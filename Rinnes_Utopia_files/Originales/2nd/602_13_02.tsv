Message	Shido	It's time for lunch.	
Message	Ai	All right. Let's do lunch.	
Message	Mai	Tohka-chan, eat with us.	
Message	Mii	The weather is nice, so let's go to the rooftop.	
Message	Tohka	"Ohhh! Lunch with everyone! Then, how about
we all exchange meals?"	
Message	Shido	"...Tohka sure has been getting closer with those
three lately."	
Message	Shido	"I want to eat lunch, but I can't find Origami. I don't
see her anywhere."	
Message	None	(Oh, well. Guess I could eat alone.)	
Message	Shido	Hm? Wait a minute. Tonomachi's over there.	
Message	Tonomachi	What is it, Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	It's been a while. Wanna eat lunch together?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Sorry, Itsuka. I don't eat lunch with guys who
have girlfriends."	
Message	Shido	What the heck...?	
Message	Tonomachi	"I'm about to hit the cafeteria. Good-bye,
Itsuka-kun. Hope your lunch is cold and sad."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tonomachi!	
Message	Shido	...Where does that bastard get off?	
Message	Shido	"Man, guess it's the classroom for me. If I can't
find Origami, I can eat by myself."	
Message	Shido	Hm. Where did Origami go?	
Message	None	(In the end, I ate by myself in the inner yard.)	
Message	None	"(Eating alone is kind of sad. I've been lucky
enough to eat with Origami lately.)"	
Message	None	(I seriously hope she's okay...)	
Message	Shido	"*yawn*... Man, I'm exhausted. Nothing worse
than the post-lunch food coma."	
Message	None	"(I can't nap in my classroom, so maybe I can
take a walk to get the blood flowing.)"	
Message	None	"(I was walking aimlessly around school before
poking my head inside of the nurse's office.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, the nurse. I don't think I've looked in
there."	
Message	None	"(I doubt I'll find Origami here, but it wouldn't
hurt to check.)"	
Message	None	(Hm...? Wait a minute. Someone's inside...)	
Message	Origami	"Are we really doing this...? What if someone
sees us?"	
Message	???	It'll be fine. Hurry.	
Message	None	"(That's Origami's voice. Who else is with her?
It sounds like a lady.)"	
Message	Origami	Will something that long... fit?	
Message	???	"It looks longer than it looks, but it fits better
than you think. Now give it a shot. Hurry
up, hop on it."	
Message	Origami	How can I hop on it...? I'm scared.	
Message	???	It's fine. Everyone does it.	
Message	None	(What the... What are they doing?)	
Message	Origami	The tip is hot.	
Message	???	"Be gentle with it. That’s right. Now, move
it slowly."	
Message	None	"(What's going on? It's not good to eavesdrop,
but I'm so curious.)"	
Message	Origami	I'll put it in. Ready?	
Message	???	Go ahead. Do it slow.	
Message	Origami	...It's in.	
Message	???	What do you think? Not too hard, right?	
Message	Origami	"Not at all. It fit in much easier than I thought
it would."	
Message	None	(O-Origami... What went in?!)	
Message	Origami	But are you sure about this?	
Message	???	"This is nothing. I'm sure you'll do this kind
of thing with your boyfriend some day. It's
better to learn how to do it now."	
Message	Origami	"With Shido... I would like... to do it...
with Shido someday."	
Message	???	"Right? If you spend time with him every day,
then it is bound to happen."	
Message	None	"(What?! What's bound to happen...?
What did Origami... Wh-What the―?)"	
Choice		Step inside.	
Choice		Keep listening.	
Message	None	"(What did Origami do...? I need to go inside
and check at once.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami!	
Message	None	"(I don't know what's going on, but I need to
find out for myself.)"	
Message	None	"(But I'm curious about Origami. What should I
do?)"	
Message	None	"(Crap! Are they leaving the room? I don't
have anywhere to hide!)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...?	
Message	Kusakabe	Ah. Your boyfriend.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you're... Origami's... Kusakabe-san?
What are you doing here?"	
Message	None	"(Why on earth is Origami's boss at our
school?)"	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh, I held a disaster prevention seminar, and
I stopped to chat with Origami. We were just
reviewing the first aid items in the infirmary."	
Message	Shido	A-And... What were you guys doing?	
Message	Kusakabe	Mm. You know...	
Message	Origami	"We were swapping out the fluorescent lights.
I had to stand on top of the chair."	
Message	Shido	S-Swapping out the fluorescent lights?!	
Message	Kusakabe	"Yeah. They were dead, so I suggested that we
change them. Origami thought it was dangerous
to replace them while the switch was flipped."	
Message	Origami	"Fluorescent lights heat up. However troubling
they may be, we must ensure they are off."	
Message	Kusakabe	"Yes. Origami admitted it was her first time
changing light bulbs, so I encouraged her to
try it out."	
Message	Origami	It was good experience.	
Message	Shido	"Ah, I see. But I overheard you mention that
she might do it with me some day."	
Message	Kusakabe	"Yes, if you are still together. It's not crazy to
think you'll have to change light bulbs some
day, right Mr. Boyfriend?"	
Message	Shido	"Aah... Well, that's thinking far ahead. Who
knows what the future holds?"	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh, why are you blushing? Origami talks
about you often. Too late to be shy about
it now."	
Message	Shido	Gah... What have you told her, Origami?	
Message	Origami	"I simply answered whatever questions she
asked me."	
Message	Kusakabe	Have you been feeling tense lately?	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no! You've only heard one side of
the story!"	
Message	Origami	Well, I may have told her about my request.	
Message	Shido	You've done too much! Where is the nurse?!	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh. A teacher got a sudden case of appendicitis
and was taken to the hospital. The nurse went
with her."	
Message	Shido	"I see... Is it okay to change the light without
permission?"	
Message	Kusakabe	"We didn't do it without permission. She gave
it to us before she left, right Origami?"	
Message	Origami	That's right. She asked us.	
Message	Kusakabe	See?	
Message	Shido	That's a relief.	
Message	Kusakabe	"If I'm not mistaken, your next class will be
a study block. I am heading home, so good
luck."	
Message	Shido	"*sigh*... Okay. Thanks for stopping by,
Kusakabe-san."	
Message	Kusakabe	Well, see you around, Mr. Boyfriend, Origami.	
Message	Shido	I didn't expect to run into her.	
Message	Shido	Why don't we head to class?	
Message	Origami	Okay, but... I have a suggestion before we do.	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Origami	We can head over, but it's only a study block.	
Message	Shido	Seems like it.	
Message	Origami	Then Shido, we should stay here in the infirmary.	
Message	Shido	You think we should ditch?	
Message	Origami	"If it is just a study block, then we are not
ditching."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. I mean, I'm not against it, but I'm shocked
that the valedictorian Origami would suggest
we ditch."	
Message	Origami	I want to talk with you... Please?	
Message	Shido	"Sure. I guess we could ditch. It's not like
anyone actually studies in the study
block."	
Message	None	"(And so, we spent the next hour inside of
the nurse's office.)"	
Message	Shido	"It is so nice and warm in here. So how are
we going to kill time?"	
Message	Origami	How about we pour some coffee?	
Message	Shido	Is there any around?	
Message	Origami	"There's instant coffee. We can boil hot water
with the kettle. All we need to do is add hot
water in the cup."	
Message	None	"(Origami emptied a packet of coffee into a
beaker.)"	
Message	Shido	You're going to put it in the beaker?	
Message	Origami	"I do not think it will affect the flavor. Is this
not to your liking?"	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it. Actually, it seems like a fun
idea. It's like we're in one of those dramas,
don't you think?"	
Message	Origami	"You may have a point. The only other thing
we can use would be the wash basin."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'll pass on that...	
Message	Origami	...It's done.	
Message	None	"(I took the coffee she handed to me, and I
looked around.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hm. I've never had the chance to look at
the stuff inside of the nurse's office before."	
Message	Origami	It is certainly well-kept.	
Message	Shido	"There are cotton swabs, alcohol, cold medicine,
anti-diarrheal... All the basics."	
Message	Origami	Shido, you can perform body measurements.	
Message	None	"(Origami pointed at the device to measure
height.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, that could be interesting. Let's see...	
Message	None	"(I got on the scale and slid the measurer
to gauge my height.)"	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Origami	170 cm.	
Message	Shido	"Hasn't changed since last time. I'll weigh
myself next."	
Message	None	"(Then, I stepped on the scale adjacent to
the height measurer.)"	
Message	Origami	...100.5 kg.	
Message	Shido	"What?! Hey, Origami! You stepped on the scale,
didn't you?"	
Message	Origami	No, I did not.	
Message	Shido	Liar. Fine. You get on next, then.	
Message	Origami	...I cannot. Regulation forbids it.	
Message	Shido	Whose regulation?! Well, whatever...	
Message	Origami	"What should we do next? Do you want to
measure your sitting height?"	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm fine now. What are other things we
can look at?"	
Message	None	"(I glanced at the objects around the room, and
saw a bed nearby wrapped in white sheets.)"	
Message	Shido	Should we rest up a bit?	
Message	None	(I threw myself onto the white bed.)	
Message	Origami	Shido, you're bold.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I've never visited the nurse's office.
It's something I always wanted to do...
HEY ORIGAMI?!"	
Message	Shido	Why are you taking off your blazer?!	
Message	Origami	You said you wanted to get into the bed...	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait. I didn't mean anything by it.	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Hey, Origami...	
Message	None	"(Origami started unbuttoning her blazer,
and mounted me lying on the bed.)"	
Message	Shido	"Origami, don't you think... this is kind of
inappropriate?"	
Message	Origami	"We're in an empty room. A bed. We are a man and
a woman. Given the circumstances, I think it
looks natural."	
Message	None	"(Origami is sitting on top of me, pressing her
weight into the top of my pants.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Crap. Don't sit like that.	
Message	None	"(I tried twisting myself, but she made it
difficult to squeeze out.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	None	"(Origami blushed, her breathing sped up.
It was like a switch was flipped.)"	
Message	None	"(She was starting to play with the buttons
on her blouse. I saw her pale white skin.)"	
Message	None	"(It was a seductive move, very enticing.
I gulped.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, can I sniff you like last time?	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay, sure. But why don't we change
positions first...?"	
Message	Origami	Today, I want to remain like this.	
Message	Shido	No, but...	
Message	None	"(This was no good. Almost unbearable. I could
feel Origami tighten her legs around me.)"	
Message	None	"(I felt a rush of blood going to my head.
Come on, Shido. Keep it together!)"	
Message	None	(I have no choice but to...)	
Choice		Ask for forgiveness.	
Choice		Scream for help.	
Message	Shido	"Origami, at the very least, could you change how
you're sitting? I'm feeling... very uncomfortable."	
Message	Origami	...Like this?	
Message	None	(Origami slid her hips a bit.)	
Message	Shido	Agh... That's no good either.	
Message	Origami	...Then, this way?	
Message	None	(She slid herself again.)	
Message	Shido	N-No!	
Message	Origami	Then, like this?	
Message	Shido	"NO! Stop moving up and down! You're
making it worse!"	
Message	Origami	I cannot find the right position to sit in.	
Message	Shido	"Th-Then, let's stop! Seriously. We can't do this
here...!"	
Message	Origami	"No, we cannot stop. My body is on fire.
Shido, be more dominant."	
Message	Shido	"On fire...? Don't say it like that! Come on now,
woman!"	
Message	None	"(Origami sat on top of me, slowly inching her
face closer to mine.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	None	"(I can't escape anymore. We're crossing a line
here...)"	
Message	None	(Just then―)	
Message	None	(I have no choice but to scream for help.)	
Message	Shido	S-Someoneeee! Help meeee!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	"We're in the middle of class right now.
This place is far from the classroom, so
no one will come. So give it up."	
Message	Shido	A-Ahhh...	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Origami	Do like when people watch...?	
Message	Shido	N-No, of course not...	
Message	Origami	"Then, what was your plan if someone really
had come?"	
Message	Shido	"I-If someone came in, then maybe you'd get
off of me?"	
Message	Origami	"To be honest, I would be paralyzed from
nervousness, and frozen in place."	
Message	Shido	What?! So, if someone came...	
Message	Origami	"They most certainly would have seen us
like this."	
Message	Shido	That's dangerous!	
Message	Origami	Only kidding.	
Message	Shido	"You were?! I guess if we're caught like this,
I'd have to do something."	
Message	None	"(My body froze from nervousness, almost like
I was being bound.)"	
Message	Origami	"If you insist, I will have no choice but to get
up."	
Message	Shido	"Don't make this into my fault! All right.
Let's get up."	
Message	None	(I tried getting up, but then―)	
Message	Student A	Excuse meeee.	
Message	None	"(I heard someone stepping into the nurse's
office.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Someone's here. Crap. Hide, Origami!	
Message	None	(We hid in the bed.)	
Message	None	"(If someone were to catch us here, it'd be
a mess. I hope we can get by.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami...	
Message	Origami	Shido, it's tight in here.	
Message	Shido	Don't talk so loud. We'll get caught.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, don't move.	
Message	Origami	But that's hard...	
Message	Shido	Ah, if you move there, I'll... *grunt*	
Message	Origami	Shido, be quiet or we'll get caught.	
Message	Shido	Hey, I said don't move... A-Ah. It tickles.	
Message	None	"(Every time Origami moved, our bodies
rubbed together, sending a shiver down
my spine.)"	
Message	None	"(Luckily, the student who came in didn't
notice and left almost immediately after.)"	
Message	None	(All that panicking tired me out.)	
Message	Shido	Man, that was close.	
Message	Origami	I found it quite thrilling.	
Message	Shido	It's because you couldn't sit still.	
Message	Origami	Shido, you were really hard!	
Message	Shido	Whoa! H-Hard...?	
Message	Origami	Your stomach.	
Message	Shido	A-Ah! My stomach! I see.	
Message	Origami	And it was big.	
Message	Shido	M-My chest, right?	
Message	Origami	No.	
Message	Shido	Then, was it...	
Message	Origami	Your arm.	
Message	Shido	Right! My arm!	
Message	Origami	And it was black.	
Message	Shido	Oh, you mean my hair?	
Message	Origami	No. Lower.	
Message	Shido	What?! L-Lower... What's down there...?	
Message	Origami	Your belt.	
Message	Shido	My belt?!	
Message	Origami	What a stimulating day. I'm quite satisfied.	
Message	None	(For some reason, my skin felt really glossy.)	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, what do you want to do next? Should
we head to class?"	
Message	Origami	"We can do that. According to the clock, class is
almost over."	
Message	Shido	Then why don't we leave separately to class?	
Message	Origami	Got it. You can go first.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	(And so, we left the nurse's office.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"Itsuka, where were you during the study
block?"	
Message	Shido	Out and about.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Come to think of it, Tobiichi wasn't there
either."	
Message	Shido	Er, well...	
Message	None	"(Man, he's sharp. If we were both gone, I guess
it was obvious.)"	
Message	Origami	We were in the infirmary togther.	
Message	Tonomachi	What?!	
Message	Shido	You don't have to tell him!	
Message	Tonomachi	Did you guys...?	
Message	Origami	It may be true.	
Message	Shido	We didn't do anything! Not a thing, okay?!	
Message	Ai	"Whoa. You're such a pervert, Itsuka-kun.
You ditched class. Where do you think he
took Tobiichi-san?"	
Message	Mai	Impure adultery. That's so gross.	
Message	Mii	So you've finally crossed the line.	
Message	Shido	N-No. Besides, Origami...	
Message	Origami	Shido, your behavior speaks for itself.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not fair, Origami.	
Message	Ai	That's so lame.	
Message	Mai	Such a turn-off.	
Message	Mii	Super ★ turn-off.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Good-bye, Itsuka-kun. You and I belong to
different leagues now."	
Message	Shido	That's not true, you guys. Listen to me―	
Message	None	"(Our secret got out to the whole school.
Soon everyone had heard about my
relationship with Origami.)"	
Message	None	"(Of course, with rumors came a flurry of
other things that weren't quite true.)"	
Message	Ai	"Itsuka-kun, I hear that you like to sniff
Tobiichi-san's underwear every day."	
Message	Mai	"I heard he's extremely tough, hard, and
big-headed. A beast. A walking X-rating."	
Message	Mii	"I heard Tobiichi-san is his 100th target. He
threw a party celebrating it the other day.
Poor Tobiichi-san. To be with a man like that..."	
Message	None	(Things went from bad to worse...)	
Message	None	(Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?)
