Message	Shido	What am I supposed to do...?	
Message	Miku	Hehe. Darling, let's go!	
Message	Shido	W-Wait!	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido. You're not going to fall for Miku's
seduction, are you?"	
Message	Shido	No, it's not like that...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Reminder. Please hurry and choose, Shido.
You should just take Kaguya's and Yuzuru's
hands."	
Message	Shido	What...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! Let's go eat kinako bread! You wanted
to have some too, right?!"	
Message	Shido	Well I guess I do, but...	
Message	Origami	"Wait, Shido. I should already be in your heart.
Remember... the day you asked me out."	
Message	Shido	W-Well that was... a little trap, kind of...	
Message	None	(Argh! Damn it! It's not settling down!)	
Message	None	"(I know! At a time like this... I'm going to have
to call the Fraxinus for help...)"	
Message	None	"(Whenever I run into issues, they always give me
some pointers or instructions. They should be
able to save me from this situation...!)"	
Message	Shido	Kotori! Help me!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, you seem to be in trouble, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Kotori!	
Message	None	"(My little sister Kotori is the Commander of the
Fraxinus. She should be a dependable advisor at
a time like this... I think.)"	
Message	Shido	Can you solve this problem for me?	
Message	Kotori	Jeez, what am I going to do with you?\nI'll bring the Fraxinus around and pick you up,\nso make a run for it to the alley.	
Message	Shido	Thanks!	
Message	Miku	Awww, where are you going, darling?!	
Message	Tohka	Wait, Shido!	
Message	None	(And that's how the Fraxinus saved me.)	
Message	Shido	Y-You saved me.	
Message	Kotori	"What are you doing, Shido? You know your
position, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"You're the only one who can seal the Spirits'
powers. You have to take them out on dates."	
Message	Shido	I-I know.	
Message	Kotori	"There are so many things we don't know about
the Spirits. Once you seal them, it doesn't
mean they won't go berserk again..."	
Message	Shido	Well... For the time being.	
Message	Kotori	"Well then, what's up with this? If you keep
doing what you just pulled, one day they might
get really mad and explode."	
Message	Shido	Well, uh... I couldn't help that situation.	
Message	Kotori	Shut up. You jewel bug.	
Message	Shido	Jewel bug...?! Hey!	
Message	Kotori	"There will be more Spirits in the future.
In other words, there's a chance that their
numbers will increase."	
Message	Shido	Then... What do you want me to do?	
Message	Kotori	"Well, at the very least, you should have chosen
someone and gotten romance points with her."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really? But if I chose one, the others
would..."	
Message	Kotori	"You could follow up with them later. Be a man
and just deal with the situation. Then the other
girls would have been impressed with you."	
Message	Kotori	"Running away from all of them was likely the
worst choice. You're less than
a Bosminopsis deitersi."	
Message	Shido	"...Just earlier I was an insect, but now I've devolved
into an organism? Gosh."	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. Who cares. Just feel bad about what
you did!"	
Message	Shido	Oof... As usual, you're such a sadist.	
Message	None	"""(She's normally an adorable sister, but when
she's in ""Commander Mode"", she's so
different. Especially because of the Spirits...)"""	
Message	Kotori	"Listen to me, Shido. Next time you run away,
I'm going to shove peanuts up your nose and
shoot them out for a high score."	
Message	Shido	What kind of game is that?! And besides...	
Message	Kotori	What?	
Message	Shido	I didn't exactly go running home.	
Message	Kotori	You're going to make excuses now?	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not that. I didn't run from my
obligations."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. Then what might you suggest you were
doing? If you say something dumb, I swear I'm
going to kick you."	
Message	Shido	You're a Spirit too, right Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	What?!	
Message	Kotori	S-So what... if I am?	
Message	Shido	I made my choice. I didn't run.	
Message	Kotori	Wh-Wh-Wh...	
Message	Shido	"Kotori. I chose you. The question was who I was
going to date; I chose you."	
Message	None	"(Kotori is one of the Spirits whose powers I
sealed. So this reasoning should work...!)"	
Message	Kotori	Wh-Wh-Wh...	
Message	Kotori	"You know what?! Wh-What are you talking
about?!"	
Message	Shido	Agh! That's messed up!	
Message	Kotori	"You're so dumb! You're just coming up with a
convenient excuse!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	I-I... I don't need to go on a d-date.	
Message	Shido	"But... With the other Spirits' emotions being
dangerous, there's a chance that you might
be in danger too, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine! I'M FINE! Don't worry about me!
I'll always care about you..."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What did you say?	
Message	Kotori	"N-Nothing! Go home already! You're getting in
the way of actual work I need to do."	
Message	Shido	What? I want to know...	
Message	Kotori	"JUST SHUT UP! I'll drop you off near the house,
so hurry up and make some dinner."	
Message	Shido	Fine. Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Hmph... Whatever.	
Message	None	"(She lectured me but... I guess I can get home
safely.)"
