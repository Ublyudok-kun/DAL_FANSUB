Message	Shido	It's so peaceful...	
Message	None	"(The time is 8 PM. We cleaned up after
dinner, and those in charge of housework were
given a moment to rest.)"	
Message	None	"(I was doing nothing in particular, simply
lazing about while flipping through TV
channels.)"	
Message	Shido	"Time for some relaxation. Now then, any
interesting shows on?"	
Message	None	"(Just then, I perked up to the sound of a
familiar voice, and suddenly someone whom
I knew quite well appeared on-screen.)"	
Message	Miku	Good evening, everyone!	
Message	Shido	Ohh, if it isn't Miku! She's on primetime TV!	
Message	None	"(Miku had been working as an idol in secret,
almost like an anonymous celebrity, but ever
since we met, she gave the OK to show her face.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. It's surreal to see her on TV... I almost
can't believe that she's my girlfriend."	
Message	None	"(It's a dream come true to be dating an idol,
after all.)"	
Message	Shido	"But... that's why, even so, it's probably for
the best to keep our relationship a secret."	
Message	None	"(It'd be terrible if there were ever a scandal.
Miku Izayoi is insanely popular, of course.)"	
Message	Shido	Maybe I should really be more careful...	
Message	Shido	"Wait, a visitor at this hour? I wonder who
it could be..."	
Message	Shido	Yes, yes.	
Message	Miku	Daaaaarling!	
Message	Shido	"M-Miku?! You're here, all of a sudden.
Wait, weren't you on TV?"	
Message	Miku	Huh? TV? But my work's done for today?	
Message	None	"(Oh, that's right. It's not a live program.
They must be playing a recording.)"	
Message	Shido	"I just saw you appear on my TV. More importantly,
what's the matter? You finished work and came
straight here?"	
Message	Miku	Yup, that's riiiight. Please listen, darling.	
Message	Shido	A-All right.	
Message	Miku	"Recently, my workload has ballooned. Goodness,
it's been difficult, working until the wee hours.
At this rate, I'll end up tired and wrinkled!"	
Message	Shido	"No, no. I don't think that would happen, but
it does sound like a lot of work. Well, maybe
being busy is a good thing for you, though."	
Message	Miku	"It's not good at all! At this rate, my chances
to see you will keep shrinking, darling!
I'll end up with Darling Deficiency Disease!"	
Message	Shido	"Deficiency. Just because we haven't seen
each other in a couple days... Can't you survive
without me that long?"	
Message	Miku	"Not "just"! For a girl who's hopelessly in love,
one day without her beloved is longer than
10,000 years!"	
Message	Shido	"Isn't the saying only 1,000 years...? Well,
it makes me glad to hear you want to see me.
You came over after working all day, right?"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, once I made up my mind, I couldn't stop
myself."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, that's flattering... I'm flattered, but
Miku-san? If your fans were to hear you
visited some guy at this hour of night..."	
Message	Miku	"Hmph. If they found out, then what? Are my
fans more important than me not being able
to see you?"	
Message	Shido	N-No, never mind. Stay as long as you'd like.	
Message	None	"(Ahh, I'm soft... I'm too soft, man.
But there's no use if she's already here.)"	
Message	Miku	"Yaaay! I got darling's seal of approval!
Then, tonight I'll be staying the night!"	
Message	Shido	"Th-That's no good! I mean, if it gets too
late, I'll take you home!"	
Message	Miku	Aw, but I want to talk with you until morning.	
Message	Shido	Well, you know, Kotori's here too... Right?	
Message	Miku	"I understand～. Then, let me stay the night
when Kotori-chan isn't around, okay?"	
Message	None	"(Urgh, I messed up... Now I'm about to put
my foot in my mouth.)"	
Message	Shido	"*sigh*... All right, I understand. I'll think
about it."	
Message	Miku	"Yaaay, then I'll be content with the attention
you give me right now, darling."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, no problem. More importantly though,
let's not stand here talking forever. Come
inside. Aren't you freezing?"	
Message	Miku	Yes. Pardon me, then.	
Message	Shido	"Are you okay with my room? If you want
to rest, the living room has a sofa. I'm sure
it'll be comfortable enough?"	
Message	Miku	"No can do. It's a girlfriend's privilege to
enter her darling's room! I said that last time,
didn't I?"	
Message	Shido	All right, then. Make yourself comfortable.	
Message	Miku	Yes, I'd love to. Hee hee hee, darling.	
Message	None	"(Ugh. Miku's snuggling up to me. I might be
tired, but I find the flushed side of her face
sexy. And her lips look really soft.)"	
Message	Miku	What are you looking at, darling?	
Message	Shido	Err, ah, no. N-Nowhere in particular...	
Message	Miku	Is that so? I felt your gaze～	
Message	Shido	I-I wasn't looking, I wasn't looking!	
Message	Miku	It's okay for you to do it...	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(Do it?! Do what?! What is it okay for me
to do?!)"	
Message	Miku	It'd be special with you, darling... Here.	
Message	Shido	Feeling comfortable, Miku?	
Message	Miku	"Yes, I feel quite comfy on top of your lap,
darling."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha...	
Message	None	"(Right now, Miku's laying her head on my lap.
I assume she's enjoying it as I stroke her hair.)"	
Message	Miku	Ahh. How therapeutic.	
Message	Shido	I hear ya. Glad you like it.	
Message	None	"(So this is what she meant by "do it".
Well, my lap's open for her any time.)"	
Message	Miku	"You really are the best, darling. All my
exhaustion from work is melting away."	
Message	Shido	"You're always busy, after all. Well, if this
relaxes you at all, don't hesitate to tell me.
I'll do anything in my power to help."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, what did you say just now～?
Do you mean you'll do anything for me～?"	
Message	Shido	"Uhh, w-well, that's just a saying. That's not
to say that I could do ANYTHING..."	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee hee. You'll do anything, anything for
me, right? Actually, there's a favor I wanted to
ask of you, darling."	
Message	Shido	A f-favor...?	
Message	Shido	Um. Is this sort of thing okay for your favor?	
Message	Miku	Yes. I wanted you to give me a massage, darling.	
Message	Shido	"But if that's what you want, wouldn't it be
better to hire a masseuse...?"	
Message	Miku	"I wanted *you* to do it, darling. Besides,
I couldn't bear the thought of another man
besides you touching me."	
Message	Shido	W-Well, if that's the case...	
Message	None	"(It can't be helped, right? This is how I found
myself giving Miku a massage, but...)"	
Message	Shido	This feels really wrong.	
Message	Miku	Darling, hurry～...	
Message	Shido	"Gaaah! Don't make it so weird, okay?!
All right, then. Please excuse me..."	
Message	Miku	Aha, that tickles. Harder, darling...	
Message	None	"(Even considering that, Miku's body is
incredibly soft. I feel like if apply too much
pressure, she'll break.)"	
Message	Shido	A-All right... Kinda like this?	
Message	Miku	"Aaaaah. No good at all. You have to press
harder."	
Message	Shido	Th-Then... Like this...!	
Message	Miku	Mmm, that's good. Just like that.	
Message	None	"(Massage. This is a massage. Nothing suspicious
about this at all. Nothing indecent happening
here!)"	
Message	Miku	"Darling? No zoning out. You must hurry and
continue."	
Message	Shido	"I-I know!
...Here we go."	
Message	Miku	...Aaaaaah.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(Gaaah. I can't do this. Touching Miku's soft
skin like this, and hearing her make those
noises, gets me feeling some kind of way.)"	
Message	Shido	"M-Miku, that should be enough, right?
I'm sure you're plenty relaxed now, right?"	
Message	Miku	"Aw, but we've only just begun. Darling,
do your best! ♪"	
Message	Shido	"Fine, all right. If I'm gonna do it, I'm doing it
until you're satisfied. Feeling stiff anywhere
else, madame?"	
Message	Miku	Hm, a bit further down if you please.	
Message	Shido	"Down? Guess near the waist...
Hm, hah."	
Message	Shido	How's that?	
Message	Miku	Mmm. Feels splendid～	
Message	Shido	"All right, then. Around here...
Anywhere else?"	
Message	Miku	Mmm, ooohh. A little more...	
Message	Shido	A little more in a different place?	
Message	Miku	Please touch, a little further down.	
Message	Shido	"Further down... Where do you want me to
touch?! You saying further than your bottom?!
Around here?"	
Message	Miku	A bit further... Like further downwards...	
Message	Shido	"Right. A bit further down... Whoa! No no no no!
Just where are you leading my hands?!"	
Message	Miku	Aww, too bad. Just a bit further...	
Message	Shido	"What do you mean, a bit further...?
If you're done, I'm stopping now."	
Message	Miku	"No, you can't. I want to flirt with you more,
darling."	
Message	Shido	"Flirt... Wasn't this supposed to be a massage?
If you insist, I'll keep going. So, where else
would you like me to massage?"	
Message	Miku	Hmm, I'll leave it to you.	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me...? This isn't a spa, you know.	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee. Touch me anywhere you'd like,
darling."	
Message	None	"(Ngh. She's totally teasing me. Then I'll be
extra thorough! If that were the case, I feel
like a choice screen should appear here...)"	
Choice		Aim for the feet.	
Choice		Rub her shoulders.	
Choice		Pretend to massage, then tickle her.	
Message	Shido	Then, I'll massage your feet.	
Message	Miku	"My feet～? Might you have a foot fetish,
darling?"	
Message	Shido	"I-It's not like that. As an idol, you're always
on your feet with singing and dancing,
right? I thought your feet might be tired, too."	
Message	Miku	"Hm. Is that so? It seemed like you had an
answer prepared, which isn't suspicious
at all."	
Message	Shido	"Ugh. I'm not being suspicious at all.
Let's get on with it already. Otherwise,
I'm done for the day."	
Message	Miku	"Goodness, guess it can't be helped.
Please go ahead."	
Message	None	"(Miku slowly stuck out one foot. It looked just
as soft as her back.)"	
Message	Miku	Hee hee, do with it as you please, okay?	
Message	Shido	"Why?! It's true there are people who are like
that. At the very least, I'm not!"	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee. You don't have to be embarrassed.
If you wanted to, darling, then I'd let you.
Here, just be honest with yourself."	
Message	Shido	"Now that you say, I'm starting to feel like I
have to—wait, wait! That isn't something I'm
into, I swear!"	
Message	Shido	"Come on, stop it with all the crazy talk.
I'm going to start, here!"	
Message	Miku	Ack. Darling, that's—!	
Message	Shido	"I'm doing a pressure point massage. It might
hurt a lot at first, but it relieves the tension,
don't you think?"	
Message	Miku	Ah, hey, wait... Aaaah!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, seems like this spot's pretty tense.
There!"	
Message	Miku	Kyaaa! Darling, stop, be more gentle!	
Message	Shido	No can do. Come on, give me your other foot.	
Message	Miku	"A-Any more... than this is...
I caaaaaan't!"	
Message	None	"(Afterwards, having thoroughly massaged
Miku's feet, despite looking exhausted,
she seemed quite relaxed. I hope it helped.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, I'm going to massage your shoulders,
so please sit down."	
Message	Miku	A classic massage. Understood.	
Message	Shido	"If your shoulders get too stiff, it can lead
to headaches. Massages are good, but it's
better to stretch every day."	
Message	Miku	"Yeeees, I know. You're acting like my
manager, darling. Or maybe, a mother?"	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. First and foremost, your boyfriend...
Well, whatever. Just try to relax."	
Message	Miku	Very well... Ahh, that's great.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, there we go. I'd like to massage around
your neck, but tying up your hair would be a
pain... Well, next time."	
Message	Miku	Yes, thank you. Whew, I somehow feel lighter.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's right. Miku, don't move for just a
second."	
Message	Miku	...? Is there something else?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, just bear with me... Here.	
Message	Miku	Oooh, a scalp massage. I see.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, they say the head has a lot of pressure
points. They do this a lot at beauty parlors,
but it feels pretty good."	
Message	Miku	Indeed. That's quite nice. Please continue.	
Message	None	"(She sure seems to be enjoying yourself.
I hear most people don't like having their heads
touched, so it's proof that she trusts me.)"	
Message	None	(...I'm starting to feel a little deviant.)	
Message	Shido	All right, Miku. Sit still for me.	
Message	Miku	Okaaaay. I understaaaand.	
Message	None	(Hehe. She's let her guard down... Here I go!)	
Message	Miku	"Huh? F-Fwhaaaa?! Wh-What are you doing,
darling?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, as I was looking at your neck, Miku,
I got the thought that it might smell nice."	
Message	Miku	"H-H-Hey, you mustn't. Suddenly smelling
someone like that."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. It must be your shampoo. It smells really
sweet, and your hair is so soft..."	
Message	Miku	Fwaaaah!! P-Please stop～!!	
Message	None	"(Surprisingly, she was flustered to an amusing
degree. Actually, I'm acting kinda perverted,
aren't I?)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, sorry. I just wanted to tease you a
little."	
Message	Miku	"To smell a woman's hair without asking...
You mustn't do this ever again, okay?"	
Message	Shido	I mean it, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.	
Message	Miku	"Goodness. I love you, so it can't be helped.
Next time, be sure to ask first. If it's you,
darling, I don't mind."	
Message	None	"(Er, no, I didn't mean it like that. Well, if
Miku's fine with it, then I guess it's okay.)"	
Message	None	"(Miku's totally open right now. I know, I need
to teach her a lesson! Sure, it sounds selfish,
but I'm sure it'll be fine.)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay then, Miku. We'll keep going.
If it hurts... I'll stop, so just say so, okay?"	
Message	Miku	All right. I understand. Please go ahead.	
Message	None	"(Hehehehe. She's totally let her guard down.
Here we go, Miku!)"	
Message	Shido	Then... I'll do this!	
Message	None	"(Over the entirety of the human body, the
spots that are most ticklish are... places where
the skin is thinnest! First, her armpit!)"	
Message	Miku	"Huh, what...? Ah, hee hee, ahahaha!
H-Hey, darling, don't!"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. I can't hear you. What's the matter,
Miku?"	
Message	Miku	Th-This isn't a massage... Th-This isn't good!	
Message	Shido	"Hmm? Did I hear you say you want me to
keep going?"	
Message	None	"(Looks like she's super ticklish. Then, time to
tickle her neck! It's one of the most sensitive
parts on the body.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, it's cliché, but here!	
Message	Miku	"Kyaa! Y-You can't do that! D-Darling, please,
have mercy!"	
Message	Shido	"Hehe, what to do? You just said you wanted
me to keep going, after all."	
Message	Miku	Y-You can't be serious!	
Message	Shido	Perhaps a little longer will do...	
Message	None	"(Oh, shoot. Kotori's here. Talk about awkward.
Miku and I fell suddenly silent.)"	
Message	Shido	D-Did she hear us?	
Message	Miku	Ummm, I'm not sure.	
Message	None	"(We were only fooling around for a bit, but
I'm starting to feel totally embarrassed. When
I realized, Miku and I sat further apart.)"	
Message	Shido	Um, I'm sorry. Let's stop for today...	
Message	Miku	Y-Yes... It felt good...	
Message	None	"(Even in our embarrassment, we both
exchanged sly smiles.)"	
Message	Shido	How do you feel? Any more relaxed?	
Message	Miku	Yes. Much better, thanks to you, darling.	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. If you ever need me, you know where
to find me. It's nice to be needed now and then."	
Message	Miku	Yes, thank you～	
Message	None	"(Perhaps Miku's words were heartfelt, as she
was blushing. Either way, I'm happy she enjoyed
it.)"
