Message	Shido	Maria, Marina! It can't end like this!	
Message	Maria	"Hee hee. I had a feeling... you would say that,
Shido."	
Message	Maria	"But I apologize. I must... disappear, along
with Marina."	
Message	Shido	No, there must be a way!	
Message	Maria	"It is too late. It is impossible to reset the
Fraxinus' authority control and for Marina
to disappear alone."	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	Maria	"I am glad you came here, Shido. Now, I can
bid you farewell."	
Message	Marina	You're right. That might be a blessing.	
Message	Shido	Marina! Are you okay?	
Message	Marina	"Shido Itsuka... You don't have time to waste,
right? What did you come here for?"	
Message	Shido	I came to save you...	
Message	Maria	"Shido, do not misunderstand. It is just that
we are not a priority for you."	
Message	Shido	Why would you say something like that...?	
Message	Maria	Shido, I have a request. Is that all right?	
Message	Shido	I don't want to hear it...	
Message	Maria	Come on, Shido. Please, let me say my piece.	
Message	Shido	...I understand.	
Message	Maria	"Soon, the Fraxinus will fall upon the Earth.
In order to prevent this, we must disappear."	
Message	Maria	"Shido, will you please erase Marina? Together,
with myself."	
Message	Shido	I didn't come here to do any of that...	
Message	Maria	"Shido, I know you are kind. And that you do not
wish to make a decision that would sacrifice any
lives. But right now, have the courage to decide."	
Message	Shido	"I can't... I can't do it! I can't abandon you
both!"	
Message	Maria	"Please, Shido. The days I spent in this world—
Tengu City—are very precious."	
Message	Maria	"That is why you must stop the Fraxinus' descent.
I wish to protect the Tengu City I saw through
your eyes."	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	Marina	"Didn't you say you would save me? I think...
That moment is now."	
Message	Shido	Marina.	
Message	Maria	"I am the Fraxinus AI. I am obviously interlinked
with the ship."	
Message	Maria	"Please do not make murderers out of Marina
and me. Even if we were created to be weapons,
I wish to protect this world, to guide you."	
Message	Shido	But, even so!	
Message	Maria	Shido! Think, who are you protecting?!	
Message	Shido	Aaah... AAAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	This is... Damn it! I... I...!!	
Message	Marina	"Aah, I see. So this is what it means to
disappear completely. It is much calmer
than how I thought it would feel."	
Message	Shido	Marina, I'm sorry... I...	
Message	Marina	"Do not apologize. Hey, Shido Itsuka...
Was I wrong this whole time...?"	
Message	Shido	"You weren't wrong...
You were being straightforward.
You were being yourself."	
Message	Marina	"Ahahaha... It's not fair that you're so kind.
Ah. There is one thing I wanted to tell you."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Marina	"When you pat my head... It brought me joy.
I thought to myself, this is what it feels like
to be shown affection by your family..."	
Message	Marina	With this, it's over...	
Message	Shido	Marina...	
Message	Marina	...	
Message	None	"(Marina looked the calmest I had ever seen
her as she faded away...)"	
Message	Maria	Next is my turn...	
Message	Shido	In the end, I couldn't save either of you...	
Message	Maria	"No, that is not true. You have done so much for
me. All the time we spent together... mattered."	
Message	Shido	Maria. In the end, I...	
Message	Maria	You kept your promise, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Pro...mise?	
Message	Maria	Yes. You taught me what love is.	
Message	Shido	"Ahh, that's right. But ultimately, the
answer wasn't..."	
Message	Maria	No, I found it. You gave it to me, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Maria	"What love is. I now understand why everyone
found it hard to answer. Putting it into words
is impossible. That's why, I'll leave with this."	
Message	Maria	Maria Arusu loves Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	Maria	Mm...	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Maria	"At the end of a date, couples partake in a
good-bye kiss. With this, I am done being
selfish."	
Message	Shido	"Don't. Don't go. I'll take you anywhere!
As many dates as you want!"	
Message	Maria	"You're so lovely when you try your hardest,
even when you know it is impossible, Shido."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Maria	"But I am happy to hear you say so, Shido.
You brought me joy until the very end."	
Message	Maria	Thank you, Shido. You are the kindest soul.	
Message	None	"(She's disappearing. That sweet smile.
She's disappearing. Leaving behind a cruel
scar.)"	
Message	Shido	Maria! MARIAAAAAAAAA!
