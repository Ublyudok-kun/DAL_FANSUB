Message	Miku	Come now, darling. Go on a date with me.	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Shido, you can't run at this point.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Recommendation. Please give it up, Shido.
Shido belongs to Kaguya and Yuzuru."	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, you'll go on a date with me!
Right, Shido?"	
Message	Origami	"No. Shido has promised to spend secret time
after school with me."	
Message	Shido	Ahhh! What do I do?!	
Message	None	(I guess I have no choice but to run for it!)	
Message	Miku	Ahhh, darling! Where are you going?!	
Message	Tohka	Wait, Shido!	
Message	Shido	No! Sorry, everyone!	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant*... This far should be good enough.	
Message	Kurumi	My... There you are, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	What...?! K-Kurumi?!	
Message	None	"(Kurumi Tokisaki. She, too, is a Spirit.
But unlike the others, we haven't sealed her.)"	
Message	None	"(Fortunately, she's integrated into society and
from time to time will visit this town.)"	
Message	None	"(I thought she'd be after my powers, but she
cooperates with me, too. I can't tell if she's
an ally or an enemy. She's very dangerous...)"	
Message	Kurumi	What a coincidence.	
Message	Shido	What are you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	Do I have to explain? It's a girl's secret.	
Message	Shido	"You'd better not have been spying on me until
now..."	
Message	Kurumi	Hm, I wonder...? Hehe...	
Message	Shido	...You're creepy, as always.	
Message	Kurumi	How rude. I am just a sweet, adorable girl.	
Message	Shido	I-I guess you're right, but...	
Message	None	"(I just can't help but feel like she's creepy...
I don't know what she's thinking.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, you're not going to deny it?	
Message	Shido	...?! Well, um...	
Message	Kurumi	You don't have to. That makes me very happy.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... So Kurumi, are you the real one?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi has the ability to manipulate time and
call her past self. There are many versions of
her, so this may not be the real her.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Why don't you see for yourself?	
Message	Shido	H-How?	
Message	Kurumi	"How, indeed... I suppose if you look inside my
skirt, you may know."	
Message	Shido	How does that help me know?!	
Message	Kurumi	My, my... You're bright red, aren't you?	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kurumi	You're so interesting.	
Message	Shido	I'm not interesting at all!	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe...	
Message	Shido	Anyways... You better not have hurt anyone.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi is the only Spirit that kills of her own
volition. I've witnessed it myself. I never want
to remember that moment.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Who knows? Maybe I was in the middle
of buying myself time."	
Message	Shido	You know...	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe, I'm only kidding. I was lucky today and
bumped into you so I'm going to go home
happy."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Is it really okay...? I feel like we
didn't resolve anything."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Then I'll be leaving...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	Good day, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"If she were just like this, she'd be a normal
girl..."	
Message	None	(...I guess I'll go home, too.)
