Message	None	"(With that said, today I'm going to spend some time
alone with Yuzuru.)"	
Message	None	"(It was a nice afternoon. I met up with Yuzuru at a
local park.)"	
Message	Shido	"I walked slowly and I ended up here right on the dot.
I wonder if Yuzuru's here already."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Call. Shido, over here. Thank you for inviting me out
on a date."	
Message	Shido	Sure. Did I make you wait?	
Message	Yuzuru	Deny. Yuzuru just arrived. Don't worry about it.	
Message	None	"(In Yuzuru's case, it's hard to know whether or not
she's telling the truth. I mean, last time she was so
early, there's a high chance that she was waiting...)"	
Message	None	"(But it's pointless to worry about it each time. If she
doesn't mind, I'm sure it's not good for me to worry
about it.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay, then let's go.	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. Do you want to go anywhere, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I thought we were going to meet up here and go
someplace else."	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru was the one who suggested meeting here, so I
thought that's what was going to happen. I guess that
wasn't the case.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Consenting. No, I was planning to spend all day here.
Is that not okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's fine. Of course I'm okay with it. But
you're okay just staying at the park? I mean, we're
on a date, so we can go where you'd like..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. I'm fine with here for today. If we went
somewhere else without Kaguya, I would feel bad."	
Message	Shido	"I see. I guess that's true. I can see Kaguya saying,
""Why didn't you take me!"""	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Kaguya is a child, so we can't help it.
Yuzuru is the mature one, so I will be satisfied
staying here so that Kaguya won't pout."	
Message	None	"(Although she says that, I can tell how much Yuzuru
watches out for Kaguya. I'm sure if we were in the
same situation, Kaguya would've said the same thing.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Shido, would you like to walk a little?	
Message	Shido	"Bring it on. I guess that's weird to say, but I was
planning on suggesting that."	
Message	None	"(Judging by the park map, there seems to be a walkway.
It'll be nice to feel the sunshine through the trees
and take a leisure walk.)"	
Message	Shido	All right, let's start walking.	
Message	Yuzuru	Silence.	
Message	Shido	Huh, what's the matter, Yuzuru?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Anger. Shido, why don't you get it? I did suggest to
take a stroll, but do you plan on going alone? You're
forgetting that I am your girlfriend."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh...! Sorry, Yuzuru... You're right.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Pardon. So long as you understand, I don't mind.
Request... Please give me your hand."	
Message	Shido	Here you go, Yuzuru.	
Message	None	(We walked together, holding hands.)	
Message	None	"(I wasn't thinking anything in particular as we slowly
strolled about. The wind blew gently, and Yuzuru
closed her eyes as if it felt nice.)"	
Message	Shido	I feel like I could easily lose track of time here.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Rebuttal. It's true that it feels nice. But since I'm
with you Shido, I don't want to miss a moment."	
Message	Shido	...That's sweet, but you're making me shy.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Doubt. Really? Yuzuru is just saying what comes to
mind."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. That's like you. I'm sure if it were Kaguya...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Attention. Shido, you are on a date with Yuzuru right
now, so wouldn't you say it's rude to bring up another
woman?"	
Message	Shido	What? Not even Kaguya?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Of course. There are times when even
Kaguya is not allowed."	
Message	Shido	Oh... I'll be careful.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Encouragement. I look forward to your efforts. We've
walked a while, so... Let's rest."	
Message	Shido	"Right. Let's sit on that bench. Should I go buy some
drinks?"	
Message	None	"(I looked around the park, but there weren't any
vending machines. But there was something else.)"	
Message	Shido	Yuzuru. Fancy going there?	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. That looks like a food truck. No problem.	
Message	Shido	Then let me go... Yuzuru, do you like coffee?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. If it's a matter of whether or not I can
drink it, there's no problem. How about you, Shido?
I hear you have to order using a magic spell."	
Message	Shido	A spell?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Commentary. For example, ""Tall double-shot with
chocolate sauce, extra coffee with whipped caramel
and cream""... Something like that."	
Message	Shido	AH?! What is that spell?!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Answer. When I went to a coffee shop the other day,
Kaguya was chanting it happily. However, when she
went to pay she screamed."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. She must have not known that they charge
for the extras... But even without that chant, I can
order."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Laugh. I actually knew. Then please, get me a regular
latte."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Wait right here.	
Message	Shido	Thanks for waiting. This is yours, Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Appreciation. I will gladly accept. Was the spell okay,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Thanks to you. I just said, ""Two tall lattes, s'il
vous plaît."""	
Message	Yuzuru	Deliberation... That's hard to judge.	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, forget what I just said... But drinking a warm
drink makes me feel so calm. Doesn't it make you
feel like you're having a nice, relaxing time?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Yes, I do feel that way. Oh, I have something
nice for you."	
Message	Shido	Nice?	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Yes Shido. Come closer. And close your eyes.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Like this...?	
Message	None	(I wonder... Yuzuru is close to me.)	
Message	Yuzuru	Appeal. Shido, I will borrow your ear.	
Message	None	"(As Yuzuru said that, suddenly gentle music came
flowing in my ear.)"	
Message	Shido	Earphones...? Oh, you brought a music player?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. I listen to this when I have the time. It's
only one side, but please bear with me."	
Message	Shido	Then the other side is...	
Message	None	"(I opened my eyes and saw that Yuzuru was leaning
against me with her eyes closed. The other side of
the earphones was connected to Yuzuru's ear.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. Shido, don't move too far away. The earphones
will come off."	
Message	Shido	...Is it only because of that?	
Message	Yuzuru	Silence. I can't answer that. You think on your own.	
Message	Shido	Is that so...	
Message	None	"(I did as Yuzuru requested and leaned against her so
that the earphones wouldn't fall out.)"	
Message	Shido	So this is what you usually listen to.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. It's healing music. This calms me the
most. Of course, I listen to other genres as well."	
Message	None	(Yuzuru played a variety of songs for me.)	
Message	None	"(Rock, pop, classical. There were also metal songs.
I'm sure that is more Kaguya's choice...)"	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru's player was on shuffle, so we listened to the
songs as they came and went, and spent a nice time
together.)"	
Message	Shido	"Thanks for coming out with me today. I had fun,
Yuzuru."	
Message	Yuzuru	Appreciation. The feeling is mutual, Shido.	
Message	Shido	It's nice to spend time like this. Let's come again.	
Choice		Just you and me again.	
Choice		Next time, it'll be the three of us.	
Message	Shido	Just you and me again.	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. Shido, what do you mean by that...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well, nothing deep. It felt different from when
it's the three of us. It's fun when we're all
together, but I feel like you were friendlier."	
Message	Shido	"So I thought you might like another day like that.
We're dating, but we don't always have to have the
three of us together, right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Unhappy. Some of your expressions are questionable,
but yes. I would like to come with you again. However,
please do not ignore Kaguya."	
Message	Shido	"I know that. That's why I said from time to time. Then
it's fine, right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Okay. Will you invite me again?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. If it would make you happy, Yuzuru. I promise.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Feverish. That makes me happy. I'm going to go home
for today... I will see you tomorrow, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Next time, we'll be sure to bring Kaguya.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Answer. Right... But I feel like from time to time, it
could just be Shido and Yuzuru."	
Message	Shido	...Huh, Yuzuru?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Leaving. Shido, thank you for today. I will be on my
way now."	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yuzuru...!	
Message	None	"(I didn't really think deeply about that. I was just
thinking of a date without Kaguya. I didn't know
then―)"
