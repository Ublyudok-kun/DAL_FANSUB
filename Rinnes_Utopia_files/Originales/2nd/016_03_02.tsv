Message	None	"(I'll go check up on Origami. She was trying to
buy something questionable earlier, so I think
I'll have to keep an eye on her.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami, I've come to help.	
Message	Origami	"No. I don't need help, even if it's from you.
This is a serious battle."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah I guess, but... You wanted to buy something
at the drug store, right? I was worried that—"	
Message	Shido	—Hey! What's that poisonous-looking bottle?!	
Message	Origami	Condiments.	
Message	Shido	"""No way! There's no way it is! And if it were a
condiment, it wouldn't have the tagline ""endless
sexual stamina""!"""	
Message	Origami	"The ultimate ideal of cooking is being creative.
By limiting yourself to conventional condiments,
you risk missing out on the best."	
Message	Shido	"But what's the point if you ignore the basics?!
Anyways, please don't mix that into your
cooking..."	
Message	Origami	"Unfortunately, I already added it in before
you came."	
Message	Shido	I was... too late.	
Message	Origami	I'm about to add the secret ingredient.	
Message	Shido	"If that wasn't the secret ingredient, what is?!
How much did you put in?"	
Message	Origami	"That's the secret part. Shido, you wait there for
me to finish."	
Message	Shido	"I just can't shake off this bad feeling... What
are you going to put in? You've already gone way
past the line of appropriate cooking ingredients."	
Message	Origami	Don't worry about it.	
Message	Shido	"Can I really trust you? Please, don't add anything
that can't be discussed over dinner conversation."	
Message	Origami	"It's okay. I promise there won't be any problems.
Relax."	
Message	Shido	Well, if you say so, Origami... Will you be okay?	
Message	None	"(But... Well, I already feel like it's too late.
I give up.)"
