Message	Tohka	"What is the meaning of this, Shido?
Explain yourself!"	
Message	Origami	"Depending on your response, it may not end well
for you."	
Message	Shido	"What do you mean, it won't end well?!
I-I mean, what kind of explanation do you want...?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... You can't avoid it now, Shido. Drop that
fake mask of yours and reveal the truth."	
Message	Yuzuru	"I concur. Kaguya is right. I would like a
satisfying explanation as well."	
Message	Shido	Well, um...	
Message	Miku	"Like I said! My dear, sweet darling is about to go
on a date with me. A DATE."	
Message	Origami	Get away from Shido this instant. Or else—	
Message	Shido	AHHHHHH! Wh-What are you going to do?!

under her skirt, and rushed to stop her.)"	
Message	Miku	"Awww, but darling and I are in love. Of course
we'd go out on dates. Right, darling?"	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Seems like you want to get burned.	
Message	Miku	"My... And all these times, you were always
approaching me."	
Message	Yuzuru	Analyzing. Kaguya is jealous.	
Message	Kaguya	"N-No, I'm not, dear sister...
Miku kept pushing that on me!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Sympathy. Kaguya doesn't have anything to push.	
Message	Kaguya	"Yuzuru! Gosh, just because you're a little bigger
than me!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Correction. It's not a little, it's quite bigger.	
Message	Shido	"Argh! Calm down, you guys! I never said I was
going on a date with Miku!"	
Message	Tohka	"I knew it! Then Shido, you must go
on a date with me!"

with me because I am his girlfriend."	
Message	Kaguya	"I beg to differ. Hehe... You come with me, Shido.
I'll show you such a good time,
you'll be in heaven."

a cake shop that's known to be delicious."	
Message	Miku	"I'm the one who invited darling on a date first.
Obviously you're going to go with me,
