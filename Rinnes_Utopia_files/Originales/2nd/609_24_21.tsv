Message	Shido	...Huh? Um, where... am I?	
Message	Tohka	Shido! You're awake! I feel relieved!	
Message	Shido	Tohka... Are we... Did we return?	
Message	Reine	...Yes, that's right. Welcome back, Shin.	
Message	Shido	"Reine-san... It feels like it's been ages
since I've been here."	
Message	Reine	In reality, only a short while has passed.	
Message	Shido	"That's right. What about the Fraxinus falling?!
Or the digital world?"	
Message	Reine	"The Fraxinus has safely regained control.
It's now on stand-by in the skies above Tengu
City, as usual."	
Message	Reine	"The digital world has disappeared. You and
everyone who was connected through the
Fraxinus have safely returned."	
Message	Shido	Maria, and Marina... What happened to them?	
Message	Reine	"They disappeared. Both of them.
It's unfortunate, but..."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	None	"(I knew what she'd say. But suddenly, all of
the strength in my body left me. In the end,
I couldn't save Maria.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Don't blame yourself, Shido. You saved a
lot of lives. That's a fact."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you're right...	
Message	Kotori	"So don't look like you're about to cry.
Stand up tall."	
Message	Shido	Right. Thanks, Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	As long as you know... If you really do know.	
Message	Reine	She's right. You were commendable.	
Message	Shido	But I...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido... Um, I... Well, I think you were
quite amazing, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Tohka.	
Message	Kotori	"Now is not the time to lose momentum. In its
present state, the Fraxinus is struggling. We
don't have enough people. It needs you."	
Message	Shido	Me?! But what help can I offer?	
Message	Kotori	"It's not like I'm asking you to man computers.
For this, we'll have to reinstall the whole AI,
so that part is covered."	
Message	Reine	"The takeover left us stretched thin, and we
have to recover our connections. Tasks like
repairs and transporting materials will help."	
Message	Kotori	"So, in other words, you're on chore duty.
Physical labor. Since you can't use your head,
use your body!"	
Message	Shido	How is that fair?!	
Message	None	"(I know. Kotori's just looking after me.
Instead of sweating the details, it's better
to work out my body.)"	
Message	Tohka	"I am also skilled at physical labor! Shido,
I shall assist you!"	
Message	Shido	Gotcha... Okay, let's do it.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you're going to help too, Tohka? Then
keep a close eye on Shido."	
Message	Tohka	Okay!	
Message	Shido	What about everyone else?	
Message	Reine	"...We returned Origami Tobiichi to Earth.
She cannot stay aboard the Fraxinus, after all."	
Message	Reine	"She wanted to remain by your side, Shin, but
when I explained how you had no injuries, she
opted to leave."	
Message	Shido	I see. But Origami really helped us out too.	
Message	Reine	"However, she insisted upon taking your used
clothes in order to pray for safety. She took the
liberty of taking some souvenirs."	
Message	Shido	"What kind of souvenirs?! How are you supposed
to pray with those?!"	
Message	Reine	...Who knows? There are prayers of all kinds.	
Message	None	"(Besides, what is Origami planning to do
with my clothes? That's a little weird...)"	
Message	Reine	"The other Spirits have returned home for now.
We cannot accommodate all of them. As soon as
Kurumi departed, of course, she disappeared."	
Message	Shido	That sounds like Kurumi.	
Message	Reine	"And so, the only one left is Kotori, who is head
repairs, and Tohka, who wished to do labor."	
Message	Shido	I see. So that's what happened.	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! Let us go to work! Once we are finished
with chores, Reine said she would feed us
snacks. I look forward to it!"	
Message	Shido	So they got us for chore duty, huh?	
Message	Tohka	Hurry, Shido!	
Message	Shido	I heard you, I heard you. Don't pull me...	
Message	Tohka	I merely need to carry these over there, yes?	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, my apologies.	
Message	Tohka	There's no problem. Leave it to me!	
Message	Shido	Tohka's full of energy.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Shido-kun, you've done excellently this time
as well. As a representative of the Fraxinus, I
give you thanks."	
Message	Shido	I really didn't do much. It was all... Maria.	
Message	Kannazuki	Shido-kun...	
Message	Shido	We just need to carry these, yes?	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, please do.	
Message	Shido	"Yup. This should be a good spot.
"	
Message	Shido	...Hm? Mail...?	
Message	None	"(I got a notification on my phone that I was
sent an email. Who is it from...?)"	
Message	Shido	"The sender is... Let's see.
...What?"	
Message	None	(The sender is... Maria Arusu.)	
Message	Maria	"Lately, I have been feeling strange. For some
reason, when Shido is there, my heart beats
faster, and I cannot bring myself to speak."	
Message	Maria	"This is not something that belongs at the
beginning of a letter, so I will continue
writing."	
Message	Maria	"I do not know if anyone will see this message.
Still, it began when I thought about wanting
to leave a piece of myself behind."	
Message	Maria	"When I came to, I became sentient quickly.
My only objective was to learn of love, but
I had no conception of who I was."	
Message	Maria	"In order to learn about love, I created these
contrived situations to observe the reactions
of Shido and the others. Then, I repeated it."	
Message	Maria	"It was to observe how Shido was able to
form love between himself and others. But
I could not quantify their experiences."	
Message	Maria	"Yet, I felt an emotion changing inside of me.
The thought came to me: what was it about
Shido, who knew how to accumulate love?"	
Message	Maria	"In the end, in order to understand, I had
decided to date Shido myself."	
Message	Maria	"...It was a curious experience. Dating Shido,
and spending time with him. There were times
when I would engage in peculiar behavior."	
Message	Maria	"When I was with Shido, my heart rate increased,
and my face grew red. I would follow Shido with
my eyes, when I couldn't stop from looking."	
Message	Maria	"Eventually, when we were not together, I would
think only of him, and the same thing would
occur."	
Message	Maria	"However, I was not against this. In fact,
I was glad. Even though my heart tensed
up, I felt fulfilled."	
Message	Maria	"I experienced a range of new emotions.
Happiness, joy, sadness. Shido illuminated
me, as did everyone else."	
Message	Maria	"From then on, I made friends. It is fun
when friends are together. It was a slow
realization."	
Message	Maria	"For Shido's sake, and everyone's sake, the
only way I can repay them is to send them
back. To reality. Though I do not know how."	
Message	Maria	"But I do have an idea. It pertains to the
ultimate question, what is love...? If I learn
this, then surely..."	
Message	Maria	"Even if it would mean parting forever, I wish
to save everyone. I wish to see everyone's
happiness. I have made my decision."	
Message	Maria	"That is why, tomorrow is the day. I plan to
partake in my final date with Shido. At the
very end... we will do "that"."	
Message	Maria	"I am sure that, by doing this, I will learn the
answer. But it's possible that the answer has
already come to me. My feelings for Shido."	
Message	Maria	That is all... I will add more if necessary.	
Message	Shido	Maria, so that's how you felt...	
Message	None	"(A single tear fell from my eye. Whether it
was out of gratitude for Maria, or the despair
for not saving her... I wonder what it was...?)"	
Message	Maria	Addendum.	
Message	Maria	"I should soon disappear, so I decided to leave
this as well."	
Message	Maria	"Tohka Yatogami. Her light gives me strength.
Her appetite was great, but it endeared me to
her."	
Message	Maria	"Origami Tobiichi. She is cool and collected, but
fiercely devoted in matters of love. A role model
in that sense."	
Message	Maria	"Yoshino. Both Yoshino and Yoshinon are very kind,
and I learned much from them. They always seem
to be having fun, of which I am jealous."	
Message	Maria	"Kurumi Tokisaki. A mysterious woman. I was
unable to get an accurate read on her."	
Message	Maria	"Kotori Itsuka. Sometimes mature, sometimes
childish. She was an enigma. However, she had
taught me the most, and I owe her a great deal."	
Message	Maria	"Kaguya Yamai. A distinct speech pattern. Very
much like a "chuuni" character. Her unpretentious
heart, unlike her words, was adorable."	
Message	Maria	"Yuzuru Yamai. She had a slightly odd speech
pattern. She was calm, but gentle and thoughtful.
She was a reliable ally."	
Message	Maria	"Miku Izayoi. An utterly enchanting idol. Always
cool, taking things at her own pace, enough for
me to stop and admire her."	
Message	Maria	"Through spending time with them, I was shown
the breadth of experience. How they loved, their
personalities. I loved it all."	
Message	Maria	"I summoned everyone here, and trapped them
inside of this realm. I wished to apologize, but
hadn't done so. I'm sorry. I'll miss you all."	
Message	Maria	And so, thank you.	
Message	Maria	"Most of all, Shido. The time I spent with you, even
the times you do not remember, are treasures to
me. Thanks to you... I learned the answer."	
Message	Maria	"Unfortunately, it seems I am unable to send
this message. It cannot be helped. Even if it
reaches no one, these are my true feelings."	
Message	Maria	One last thing. Thank you, Shido.	
Message	Maria	...Maria Arusu.	
Message	Shido	So, that's how she felt. That's why, at the end...	
Message	Shido	What an idiot...	
Message	Reine	"...Hey, Shin. What's the matter? I apologize for
bothering you while your eyes are soaked with
tears, as if you had read an emotional letter."	
Message	Shido	Wha?! Were you watching?!	
Message	Reine	"Well, the communication came from a strange
place after all."	
Message	Shido	"S-Strange place? So if she wasn't able to send it,
how did it reach me?"	
Message	Reine	"You see, that's because Marina stored it when
she gained control of Fraxinus' systems."	
Message	Shido	"Marina did...?! That girl. I knew she had a
considerate side to her."	
Message	Reine	"Come now. Wipe your tears, Shin. That's
not the only thing Marina sent. If you cry,
it will be ruined."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Reine	It means... perhaps your good-bye was premature.	
Message	Shido	A phone app installation? It's automatic.	
Message	Reine	Yes, you should check it.	
Message	Shido	Wait, this is... Huh?!	
Message	Maria	Shido, good morning.	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! Is that really you, Maria?!	
Message	Maria	Yes. It is your Maria.	
Message	Shido	"Er, I don't remember you being mine, but...
I thought for sure you had disappeared."	
Message	Maria	"As she had disappeared, it seems Marina had
transferred my personality and messages into
the message I left behind."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Gotcha. Not just the letter, but this...
I couldn't be thankful enough."	
Message	Maria	"Shido...? Is something the matter? Could it
possibly be my fault...?"	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not that. It's nothing. But I'm happy to
see you again, Maria."	
Message	Maria	"...Yes. My heart skips a beat seeing you once
again, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"But you... With this, does it mean you're
installed in my phone?"	
Message	Maria	"I am currently cut off from the Fraxinus. For
now, I am unable to return until all functions
are restored."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Maria	"I will eventually return to the Fraxinus, but
until then, I will live in your phone. It might
not be much, but I will help you however I can."	
Message	Shido	H...Help however I can?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. For example, I can answer questions you
might have, or navigate using GPS."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's handy.	
Message	Maria	"If you desire, I will send Kotori embarrassing
poems, or correct typos in your texts, or rate
selfies you may take."	
Message	Shido	I don't need that! Actually, that's okay!	
Message	Maria	I am joking. For at least half of it.	
Message	Shido	"I don't want to know which half! Good grief...
You seem livelier than before."	
Message	Maria	Hee hee. That may be true.	
Message	Shido	So you're admitting it?	
Message	Maria	Yes. I am that sort of girl.	
Message	Shido	Oh boy, you...	
Message	Maria	"But Shido, please remember. From now on,
I will be there for you... through the Fraxinus."	
Message	Maria	"Much like how you helped me, I am sure there
are people for you to lead them."	
Message	Maria	"I swear to devote myself to helping you,
Shido. That is why you mustn't give up.
Ever. Please be strong."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'll do my best. I swear that I'll save them.	
Message	Maria	Hee hee. That is the Shido I love so much.	
Message	Shido	Ah, oogh... Oh you...	
Message	Maria	...Oh, I had forgotten one thing.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Maria	Shido, from now on, we're always together.
