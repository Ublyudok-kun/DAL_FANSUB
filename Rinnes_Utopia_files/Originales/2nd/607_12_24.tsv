Message	Shido	"*sigh* I finally made it.
I'm definitely late..."	
Message	None	"(Today, I promised to go on a date with Miku.
Because of her hectic schedule, it's something
of a tryst. She's always on the move.)"	
Message	Shido	"Even though I was carefully checking my watch
to make sure I wouldn't be late, I never could've
expected there to be an accident on the road."	
Message	Shido	"I didn't think I'd be this late...
Miku didn't go home, did she?"	
Message	Miku	Ah, daaaarliiing. Over here!	
Message	Shido	"Thank goodness... She's here. Sorry for
keeping you waiting!"	
Message	Miku	"No no, it's all right. It can't be helped if
there was trouble."	
Message	Shido	"I'm really sorry... Wait, huh? I thought our
date today was secret. You're wearing your
normal clothes. Don't you need a disguise?"	
Message	Miku	"Hmph. Goodness, darling. We rendezvous
and all you talk about is my outfit? Isn't
there something else you want to say?"	
Message	Shido	"Oogh. That's right... I shouldn't be asking when
I was the late one—"	
Message	Miku	"Noooot thaaaat! I said it couldn't be helped,
right?"	
Message	Shido	Huh, really? Then, what...?	
Message	Miku	"Goodness. You truly are a big doofus, darling.
I can't believe it. A girl's gone and gotten all
dressed up, but you barely noticed, you know?"	
Message	Shido	Y-You're right, but... you know...	
Message	Miku	No ifs, ands, or buts!	
Message	Shido	You look cute today, Miku.	
Message	Miku	...That won't do. Once more, with feeling.	
Message	Shido	"Er, ah, well... For me, it's a given that you're
cute, so I guess the thought hadn't crossed
my mind."	
Message	Miku	"...!
"	
Message	Miku	Darling... How precious.	
Message	Shido	"Um, I'm sorry for not being a more thoughtful
boyfriend."	
Message	Miku	"No, the fact that you love me, darling...
is more than enough for me to understand.
This thought alone fills me with bliss."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Miku. I'm really happy, too.	
Message	Miku	Darling!	
Message	Shido	Miku!	
Message	Ai	Hey, could that be...	
Message	Mai	The idol, Miku Izayoi?	
Message	Mii	It seriously is...	
Message	Shido	"Oh crap. Did they spot us?! Let's go, Miku!
Over here!"	
Message	Miku	Eeeek! You're so pushy, darling!	
Message	None	"(Pulling Miku by the hand, we bolted from
that spot. Jeez, dating her has been a
whirlwind from the start.)"	
Message	Shido	We should be fine right here...	
Message	Miku	"Goodness, darling. I've said this before, but
I don't mind who knows about us at all, okay?"	
Message	Miku	"After all, you are the person to whom I've
promised my future, darling."	
Message	Shido	"Wait, wait. I did say that I would care for you,
Miku, but I don't remember anything about
promising our futures."	
Message	Miku	"Whaaaat?! So that means, our relationship
was just a fling for you, then.
"	
Message	Miku	*sniffle, sniffle*...	
Message	Shido	Wha? I didn't say that!	
Message	Miku	Are you suuure? Are you really serious about me?	
Message	Shido	Yes, you're always on my mind.	
Message	Miku	Do you promise to always treasure me?	
Message	Shido	"Yes, I'll always treasure you. I can promise
you that."	
Message	Miku	Then, our futures together...	
Message	Shido	"Gaaaah, you almost got me again! That's
still too soon for us, in many ways!"	
Message	Miku	"Goodness, time only moves forward.
You worry too much about the details, darling."	
Message	None	"(I-Is that true? I think it's bigger than just a
detail. I wonder what the difference is to Miku.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, either way, we'd better get going. There's
a store you wanted to check out today, right?"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, that's right～. It has plenty of cute
accessories, and it's very close to here."	
Message	Shido	All right, then let's go. Right away.	
Message	Miku	"Hmph. You're not trying to fool me, are you
darling?"	
Message	Shido	"I-I swear I'm not! I was late, remember? We
don't have much time!"	
Message	Miku	...I suppose that's true. I understand.	
Message	None	"(Whew. Still, I wonder what's wrong with Miku
today. She's acting different than usual.)"	
Message	Miku	"Wow! What a collection of accessories!
Certainly makes the trip worth it!"	
Message	None	"(This sales rack would catch the eye of any girl
who walks by. Surprisingly, there's just as
many guys as girls. Mostly in couples, though.)"	
Message	None	"(I see Miku bouncing happily from shelf to
shelf. All of the customers here seem to be
smiling, too.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, with that excited look on her face,
I guess they won't notice that she's Miku
Izayoi from the TV."	
Message	Miku	Darling, darling! Please come over here!	
Message	Shido	"I can hear you without you shouting. I'm
not going anywhere."	
Message	Miku	"Aw, someone's being grumpy again. I wasn't
even being that loud."	
Message	Shido	Sure sounded pretty loud... Good grief.	
Message	None	"(But if she's that happy, then coming here
together was worth it.)"	
Message	Shido	What are you looking at?	
Message	Miku	"See, this coffee cup. It comes in a set. Isn't
it so cute?"	
Message	Shido	I see. It is pretty cute.	
Message	None	"(Miku was looking at a coffee cup. It was
packaged with a matching saucer and a teaspoon.
It was a set of two, potentially for couples.)"	
Message	None	"(It was on the pricier side, but if it made
Miku happy, it would be the perfect gift.)"	
Message	Shido	"Then, it'll be my present to you, in celebration
of today. Perfect, isn't it?"	
Message	Miku	"Huh? Darling...? Does this mean what I think
it means?"	
Message	Shido	"Uh, what does it mean? What are you talking
about?"	
Message	Miku	"Well, buying matching tableware...
You know what that means, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	"Living together... Ack, wait!
N-No, that's not how I meant it!"	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee. Buying tableware together as a
couple is romantic, isn't it?"	
Message	None	"(Oh, I see. That explains all the couples in
the store. I'm starting to get uncomfortable.)"	
Message	Miku	"Oh, darling. How about these plates over here?
They're to die for."	
Message	None	"(Oogh. I'm hearing everything she's saying in
a new light now.)"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. You're right. It's pretty cool.	
Message	Miku	"Oh? You aren't saying it again, huh? That
you'll get one for me as a present."	
Message	Shido	"Urgh. Miku, you're trying to pull a fast one
on me, aren't you?"	
Message	Miku	"Huhhh? What are you talking about?
I haven't said anything at all."	
Message	None	(Damn it. I can see her holding back laughter.)	
Message	Clerk	"Um. Is there something in particular you're
looking for?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, no. We're just looking around.	
Message	Clerk	"Are you two possibly students?
How nice, you're so lovey-dovey."	
Message	Miku	"That's riiiiight. He said to me that, once we
graduate, we're going to live together."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Clerk	My, how wonderful!	
Message	Shido	"U-Um, she's just joking.
And we've only just started seeing each other..."	
Message	Clerk	We have plenty of customers like that here.	
Message	Shido	Erm?!	
Message	Clerk	"You know what they say. Age is just a number.
Several of our patrons here are in the same
position as you."	
Message	Miku	See, I knew it!	
Message	None	"(Hello, earth to the store attendant! I get
being good at the upsell, but this is
ridiculous!)"	
Message	Miku	"Truthfully, although the day for us may soon
come, he... hasn't come to a decision yet.
What can I do?"	
Message	Clerk	I believe you need a big push for that.	
Message	Miku	A big push, you say... Carry on.	
Message	Clerk	Men nowadays seem so terrified of commitment...	
Message	Miku	I see...	
Message	Shido	"Gaah! That's enough, thanks. Come on, Miku.
Let's go!"	
Message	Miku	Aww, darling! You're so mean!	
Message	Clerk	"We always have the perfect products in stock,
so please visit us again soon!"	
Message	Shido	Whew. I panicked. That was a close call.	
Message	Miku	I wanted to keep browsing...	
Message	Shido	"Sorry about that. I just couldn't handle the
vibe there. It felt like a little too much too
soon."	
Message	Miku	"It wouldn't be so embarrassing if you just
act more confident. However, that can't be
helped. Oh well, on to the next place～!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Miku. Is there something special about
today's date?"	
Message	Miku	Huh? Umm, what do you mean...?	
Message	Shido	"It feels like everything is conspiring to have
us live together."	
Message	Miku	"That's not true. It's just your imagination,
darling. ♪"	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Miku	"More importantly, there's something I want
right now. If I asked you, would you buy it for
me?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? Well, if it's something you want,
or something I can afford, then sure, but
couldn't you easily buy it yourself?"	
Message	Miku	"There'd be no point if I bought it myself...
It has to a present from you, darling."	
Message	Shido	"No point if you bought it yourself...
Do you mean...?"	
Message	None	"(Suddenly, as I followed Miku's gaze, I saw
a somewhat upscale jewelry shop. Something
that means more coming from me, could it be?!)"	
Message	Shido	Do you possibly mean... an engagement ring?	
Message	Miku	Is that no good...?	
Message	Shido	It's not a matter of good or not, it's just...	
Choice		Isn't it still early?	
Choice		I'm not prepared yet.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Miku.
I think it's a little too early for that."	
Message	Miku	"I thought as much. It's expensive, so the
prospect isn't so easy. Too bad～"	
Message	Shido	"No, please listen. I want to be there for you
and take care of you, so, well..."	
Message	Shido	"Even if I am a student, I'm still a kid, so I
want you to wait until I can provide for you
properly, Miku."	
Message	Shido	"Once I become worthy of you, then I'll come
back to you. Is that... not okay?"	
Message	Shido	"...Miku? Is something wrong? Your face is
all red."	
Message	Miku	Er, ah, eek! I-It's nothing at all...	
Message	Shido	"Er, nothing at all... It doesn't seem like
nothing."	
Message	Miku	I-It really is nothing!	
Message	Shido	G-Got it. If you say so. So, is that okay?	
Message	Miku	Huh...? Is what okay?	
Message	Shido	"Er, well, what I was just talking about. Were
you listening? It's kinda embarrassing for me,
but I can say it again..."	
Message	Miku	"N-No, you can't! I was listening properly!
I was listening! Those sorts of things, if
you repeat them too much..."	
Message	Shido	If I repeat them too much...?	
Message	Miku	"Erm, well, it'll ruin it! Important things only
need to be said once. That's what makes
them special..."	
Message	None	"(Special, because they only need to be said
once... I see. Guess that makes sense.)"	
Message	Shido	Right, I'll be more careful from now on.	
Message	Miku	Yes, please do.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Ai	Did you hear that just now?	
Message	Mai	Right in public and everything.	
Message	Mii	"Students these days are getting out of hand...
Seriously, they're so young."	
Message	Shido	F-For now, Miku... Let's move somewhere else.	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Miku. I'm not prepared for that yet.	
Message	Miku	"Don't worry, darling. I know you're a late
bloomer.
"	
Message	Miku	But... it's too bad...	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I want to provide for you, Miku. That
much is true. Even if your fans discover me, and
they threaten to beat me up, I won't run away."	
Message	Miku	*snort, snicker*... Aha, hahahaha!	
Message	Shido	...Huh? Miku?	
Message	Miku	"Oh, darling. Of course I'm joking. I don't think
I could get married so easily either. Don't you
worry."	
Message	Shido	"Wha? Ah, so it was a joke... I thought you
were being serious."	
Message	Miku	"I'm sorry. I just wanted to tease you a bit,
darling."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Miku	"But if you had said you would marry me,
even if you knew it'd be impossible now,
I would have been on top of the world, you know?"	
Message	Shido	"Oogh, I'm sorry. I couldn't show you that side
of myself."	
Message	Miku	"It's all right. I am pleased to have learned
that you think of me seriously, darling.
Thank you, darling. ♪"	
Message	Shido	"Of course. Thanks for putting up with such
a disappointing boyfriend."	
Message	Miku	Goodness, truly so... Hee hee hee.	
Message	Shido	Hahahaha!	
Message	Shido	"Now then, where to after this? Since we're
here, I'll let you go ahead with whatever
you had planned for today."	
Message	Miku	"Um, darling? Instead of the ring, I have a
single request. Is that okay?"	
Message	Shido	"A request in place of a ring? Sure, but...
What is it?"	
Message	Miku	That's...	
Message	None	(Miku whispered her request into my ear.)	
Message	Shido	"Well, hm. I did say that I'd do anything in
place of a ring, but..."	
Message	Miku	Is it no good?	
Message	Shido	All right, then. Miku, give me your hand.	
Message	Shido	L-Like this?	
Message	None	"(Miku's request was to kiss her finger on her
left hand, where her ring would go. Likely a
gesture of undying love.)"	
Message	Miku	"Yes. It's wonderful. Um, if you could, please
say something charming."	
Message	Shido	"Something charming, huh? Have something
in mind? I'd appreciate it if it were simple."	
Message	Miku	"Hmm, let me see... Say something cool!
Think of what a prince would say."	
Message	None	"(The bar has just been raised. W-Well, can't
be helped. Girlfriend gets what girlfriend
wants.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oof, let me see. A toast... to your eyes.
Like that?"	
Message	Miku	Not exactly...	
Message	None	(No good, huh. Tough crowd I guess.)	
Message	Shido	Hmm, um... T-To eternal love, with you...	
Message	Miku	...Yes. darling.	
Message	None	"(With my statement, I offered a reverent kiss
to Miku's hand. The thought came too late, but
I realized that I was doing this in public.)"	
Message	Miku	Thank you, darling. I'm so very happy.	
Message	Shido	Um. Are we all good now?	
Message	Miku	Aww, just a little longer pleeeease.	
Message	Shido	"All right, all right. I understand, princess.
As you wish."	
Message	None	"(For now, this is as much as I can do,
but I have to become a man worthy of
Miku. One day.)"	
Message	Shido	More importantly...	
Message	Ai	My, get a room, why don't you?!	
Message	Mai	"Right out in broad daylight. My heavens, the
scandal..."	
Message	Mii	"Young people, nowadays... Truly the end
of times."	
Message	Shido	"Them again... It's no use. Let's get out of
here, Miku!"	
Message	Miku	Aw, darling! You're so fast!	
Message	None	"(And so, for the umpteenth time today, the
two of us grabbed each other's hands and
started running.)"
