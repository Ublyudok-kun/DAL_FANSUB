Message	Kannazuki	Oh, Shido-kun.	
Message	Shido	"Kannazuki-san? What are you doing in this
alley?"	
Message	Kannazuki	Just purchasing some equipment. Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	"What's with the suspicious laugh? Just so
we're clear, why don't you show me what
you're buying?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Let me see... Perhaps as compensation, you
could assist me with something?"	
Message	Shido	Me? Sure, but...	
Message	Kannazuki	"Thank you. Then, allow me to show you...
First, this is a device which allows you to
take footage from distant places."	
Message	Shido	A hidden camera, huh?	
Message	Kannazuki	"This device allows you hear sounds from
a distant place."	
Message	Shido	So a wiretap.	
Message	Kannazuki	"And this is the centerpiece! A state-of-the-art,
airtight pack, which can enclose and contain
air!"	
Message	Shido	...I have no clue what you'd use that for.	
Message	Kannazuki	"You don't know? If I set this up in the
commander's room, then I'll always
have the commander's scent!"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kannazuki	"By the by, in order to make practical use of
this, I need human resources who can enter
the commander's room."	
Message	Shido	"I understand. We need to go to the police,
right? Then let's go. Let's go this instant."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Shido-kun! Shido-kun!! Have mercy!!
"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Ahh, but that ruthlessness is so like the
commander!"
