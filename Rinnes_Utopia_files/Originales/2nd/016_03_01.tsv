Message	None	(I'm going to go check on Tohka.)	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, I've come to help you...
What are you doing?"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, Shido! I'm going to make you eat the ultimate
meat dinner. Just you wait."	
Message	None	(On the cutting board was a big hunk of meat.)	
Message	Shido	Where did you get that thing...	
Message	Tohka	"What are you talking about? It was at the market
you took me to."	
Message	Shido	"Are you serious? Since when has the market had a
section like this?"	
Message	Tohka	"I asked a vendor at the meat corner, and he
brought me an industrial-sized portion."	
Message	Shido	Why would they do this?!	
Message	Tohka	"Just watch, Shido. I'm going to use the knife
to..."	
Message	Tohka	...Hngg...	
Message	Tohka	Hnnn... This is hard...	
Message	Tohka	Oh! I did it?!	
Message	Shido	"Hey! What's the point in cutting
the cutting board?!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm. This is hard.	
Message	Shido	No, the meat is too big...	
Message	Tohka	Anyways, let's pan fry it.	
Message	Shido	You're going to cook it as is?!	
Message	Tohka	Here we go.	
Message	Shido	"Don't just sear it on the stovetop burner!
The oil! It's getting all over! Oh, God!"	
Message	Tohka	"But Shido, I can't help it. It's not going to fit
into the frying pan."	
Message	Shido	"I'll get you a little barbecue setup. So cook it
outside... Please."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm.. Very well. I guess I'll do that.	
Message	Shido	I think that way it'll turn out more delicious.	
Message	Tohka	"Okay! Today I'm going to cook for you, so you wait
over there, Shido."	
Message	Shido	No, but... Are you sure you can cook it?	
Message	Tohka	Leave it to me! Just go over and wait comfortably!	
Message	None	"(...Fine. I guess it's pointless helping. I'll
have to give up here and place my bets elsewhere.)"
