Message	Shido	Whew... Talk about a packed day.	
Message	None	"(I let out a sigh as I rolled into my bed,
letting the exhaustion get the better of me.)"	
Message	None	"(Maria... She's starting to express a whole
range of emotions.)"	
Message	None	"(At times, she's impressed. Other times, she pouts
like a child.)"	
Message	None	"(I've also caught her laughing modestly,
or telling jokes.)"	
Message	None	"(She seems to grow day by day. Showing
more and more faces. She's a mysterious girl.)"	
Message	None	"(Even so, I'm sure I can rest easy now. I'm
gonna fall asleep...)"	
Message	None	(I look forward to whatever tomorrow holds.)	
Message	None	(Hmm? What is that noise?)	
Message	None	(The window...? Is someone outside?)	
Message	None	"(Make no mistake. Someone's throwing
pebbles or something at my window.)"	
Message	None	(Who on earth is it?)	
Message	None	(Ah?!)	
Message	None	"(When I opened the window, Maria was there...
Wait, that can't be right.)"	
Message	None	"(She looked up at me, and beckoned towards
me with a daring smile. It's the girl who
resembles Maria... The black-clothed Arusu.)"	
Message	Shido	Why are you here? It's so late.	
Message	None	"(The black-clothed Arusu remained silent,
continuing to beckon me.)"	
Message	Shido	I understand. I'll come down there.	
Message	None	"(I spun around and left my bedroom. I made
sure to sneak out carefully so as to not alert
the others.)"	
Message	Shido	...What do you want from me?	
Message	Arusu	"Ahahaha. The night sky is beautiful. So nice.
Perfect for an evening date."	
Message	Shido	"What are you suggesting? We'll catch a cold
being out this late, you know?"	
Message	Arusu	"I couldn't possibly catch a cold. It's my world,
after all."	
Message	Shido	I mean... You have a point.	
Message	Arusu	Hey, Shido Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	What is it, black outfit?	
Message	Arusu	Don't you think it's rude to call me that?	
Message	Shido	Fine then. What is it, Arusu?	
Message	Arusu	You'd better teach me what love is.	
Message	Shido	"What are you saying? Of course. Didn't I make
a promise?"	
Message	Arusu	I see... You're right.	
Message	Shido	What's wrong?	
Message	Arusu	"Ah, no. It's nothing.
"	
Message	Arusu	Then, I'll be on my way. See you.	
Message	Shido	Ah, hey!	
Message	None	(After saying her piece, Arusu ran off.)	
Message	Shido	Wait! Who exactly are you?!	
Message	None	"(Forgetting how late it was, I raised my voice
and chased after her.)"	
Message	Arusu	Ah ha ha, I'm me. I'm Arusu.	
Message	None	(Her mischievous laughter echoed in the darkness.)	
Message	None	"(Eventually, I lost sight of her when she turned
the corner.)"	
Message	None	"(In pursuit, I turned the same corner. In front
of me, I saw another intersection.)"	
Message	Shido	Which way did she go?	
Message	None	"(Looking in each direction, I blindly ran towards
the right.)"	
Message	None	(However...)	
Message	Shido	I lost her... She's surprisingly speedy.	
Message	None	"(Laid out before me was an endless sprawl
of asphalt, lit under dim streetlights,
stretching into the darkness.)"	
Message	None	(It's no use... I'll head home.)	
Message	None	"(With nothing to show for it, I return home.
Running out there gave me a burst of adrenaline,
from which I had begun to come down.)"	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	"(When I made it back to my house, I saw Maria
looking up at the night sky. Why'd she come out
all of a sudden?)"	
Message	Shido	Maria... Weren't you asleep?	
Message	Maria	I felt like I had been called.	
Message	Shido	Called? By what?	
Message	Maria	I do not know. It may have been a mistake.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Then, let's head back inside. It'd be no
good if you caught a cold."	
Message	None	"(Wait. She can't catch a cold, right? Or does
that only apply to the one in black?)"	
Message	Maria	Yes. The hour is late, so let us retire.	
Message	Shido	"Good idea. You're right. I'm tired. Don't
sneak into my bed tomorrow, okay?"	
Message	Maria	I cannot agree to that.	
Message	Shido	Are you serious...?	
Message	Maria	"I have already discovered that sleeping with
you, Shido, is a source of great comfort."	
Message	Shido	What am I, a dakimakura...?	
Message	None	(Please, give me a break...)	
Message	None	"(Letting out a sigh, I follow Maria into the
house and up the stairs.)"	
Message	None	"(But if tomorrow is like today... I'm either
going to be terrified, or I'll have a terrible
day. No, I need to make the most of what comes.)"
