Message	None	"(As a result of the day's events, we're now
shopping for a dinner cook-off at home.)"	
Message	Shido	"But our kitchen doesn't have enough space for
everyone to cook. What are we going to do about
that?"	
Message	Kotori	"There are kitchens in the Spirit Mansion as well.
They can all cook there and bring their food over."	
Message	Shido	Ah, I see. Uh... so are you participating, too?	
Message	Kotori	"Kinda. I mean, this event is right out of the gal
game book. Participating means a higher chance
we'll be able to progress further and escape."	
Message	Shido	Can... you even cook?	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I'll figure something out. Besides, aren't
there more people you need to be worried about?"	
Message	Shido	Dear sister, don't remind me...	
Message	Tohka	"Hmmm, what will be on the menu for tonight... Oh!
Something smells good!"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, Shido! What is that "pan-fried squid"?! Is
it good? It is, isn't it?!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it is. But let's not get it today. We're
about to cook together."	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami has already set herself apart as
the loser. She shouldn't be distracted by other
foods while shopping for the meal of a lifetime."	
Message	Shido	"Origami, why are you heading into the drug store?!
I saw you reading the sign just now, and you're
still going in!"	
Message	Origami	"In China, there is a saying that doctors and food
are from the same root."	
Message	Shido	"That's not what it means! And let's just stick
to the supermarket for ingredients! Please!"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, just as I suspected. Feels like everyone's
going to whip up something dangerous.
So who's left..."	
Message	Yoshino	What do I do... What should I make, Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Anything you make will be delicious if you make\nit with love! But if you ask me, you might have\nbetter success if you tell him, 'Please eat me—'"	
Message	Miku	"Oh, am I not allowed to call for help? I was going
to have a girl from the Rindouji Cooking Club help
me."	
Message	Miku	"Oh well ♪ Darling said he would be my fan until
the very end, so I'm sure he'll enjoy my cooking～"	
Message	Miku	"I'm going to squeeze out the contents of my heart
and pour it into your dinner. It will be my finest
offering, darling..."	
Message	Kotori	"...I thought she'd be okay, but she may not be the
best either."	
Message	Shido	Hey guys, is this really going to be okay?	
Message	Kotori	"Well, the Yamai Sisters and Kurumi seemed to be
confident, so you probably won't die... I mean,
in the end, this is a virtual world anyways."	
Message	Shido	"That's your reasoning?! Then you're pretty much
telling me if this were the real world, I would
probably die!"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, if you really die here, there's a chance you
might go into shock in the real world and die
there, too."	
Message	Shido	How can you say that so casually?!	
Message	Kotori	"Like I said, you'll be okay! You probably won't
die, you'll just feel like you are!"	
Message	Kurumi	"I am going to go off on my own. I don't want to
know anyone's plans or let anyone know mine.
I don't think it would be fair."	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. Please, can you make something normal?
I don't have high hopes for the others..."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. Well then, please look forward
to my cooking."	
Message	Shido	Now... Everyone, let's go in.	
Message	Tohka	Mmm! This looks delicious! I want to eat this!	
Message	Tohka	"What do you say, Shido? Don't you think it looks
good? You can pan fry or simmer meat.
It's delicious!"	
Message	Origami	"Weak. At this point we know who will
be victorious."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What did you say...?!	
Message	Origami	"You're just choosing what you want to eat. It's
not in Shido's best interests."	
Message	Tohka	"Grrr... I-I'm just choosing delicious things.
Shido likes delicious things too, you know!"	
Message	Origami	"But people have their own preferences. Also, if
you repeat the same types of cooking, you'll get
bored of it. I know all of Shido's daily meals."	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait! Why?! How do you know?!	
Message	Kotori	"And Tohka, you eat the same food as Shido every
day, so wouldn't it be the same?"	
Message	Origami	"Ever since Tohka Yatogami started to beg for food,
Shido's cooked meat-type dishes to match her
preference. It's not what he usually likes."	
Message	Tohka	"I-Is that really so...?! Grrr, then Origami
Tobiichi, what do you choose?!"	
Message	Origami	"If it were me, I wouldn't choose anything lined up
there."	
Message	Tohka	What?! What do you mean by that?!	
Message	Origami	"Shido is currently lacking the adequate vegetable
intake... I believe I heard him muttering so in
the bathroom, so I am sure of it."	
Message	Shido	"Origami?! Origami-san?! I do remember saying that!
But how did you even hear it?!"	
Message	Origami	"That's why tonight's menu will be vegetable-based.
Unlike you, Tohka Yatogami, I can say that I am
already victorious at the food selection process."	
Message	Kotori	You were about to go into the pharmacy earlier...	
Message	Tohka	"Hey... But you do lack something,
Origami Tobiichi!"	
Message	Origami	That is impossible on every level.	
Message	Tohka	"Hehehe... Yoshino told me during class that
passion yields greater results! And I like to
eat more than you do, Origami Tobiichi!"	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami's attachment to eating is
abnormal... I see. I can't let my guard down,
then."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... You have a point. A sense of attachment
will increase your abilities from time to time."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Flashback. Kaguya was victorious during the first
cooking battle. Kaguya is more of a pig compared
to Yuzuru. No wonder I lost."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... However, Yuzuru's fire of life created the
Golden Artifact. That was incredibly delicious."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Assumption. You are talking about the omelette.
This time, we can create an evolved version of it.
With your sauce, Kaguya, it will be perfect."	
Message	Shido	Hey, what happened to Miku and Yoshino?	
Message	Kotori	"They went to the shopping district. I'm sure
people will be nice to those two. They might
even get some good tips."	
Message	Shido	I see. You're not going to go?	
Message	Kotori	"How many years do you think we've been siblings?
I know everything you like. Leave it to me."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmmmm... Hm! This! This meat seems the most
delicious."	
Message	Origami	"Given Shido's current diet, his height, his
weight, and his exercise time... I'm going to
plan the perfect intake of vitamins and minerals."	
Message	Shido	I wonder how this is going to pan out...	
Message	Kotori	"That reminds me. I should probably go buy
something for indigestion."	
Message	None	"(And the cook-off has begun. I'm sure I'll be
bored just waiting around. Maybe I can help
someone.)"	
Message	None	(Who should I help...?)	
Choice		Tohka	
Choice		Origami	
Choice		Kotori	
Choice		Yoshino	
Choice		Next	
Choice		Kurumi	
Choice		The Yamai Sisters	
Choice		Miku	
Choice		Back	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... This is starting to hurt.	
Message	None	"(I may have eaten too much... And some of the
dishes were questionable, to say the least.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm kind of... getting sick. Hm...?	
Message	None	"(I just realized. There's dessert.
Who made that...?)"	
Message	Shido	"Is it pudding... or bavarois? Judging from the
color, there seem to be some fruits in it."	
Message	Shido	"...Yeah, it's a little sweet and tart.
Pineapple... figs? And some yogurt."	
Message	Shido	"Ah... This is so good. I can feel my stomach
finally settling."	
Message	None	"(It was a little over-steamed and not strained
completely, so the texture was a bit grainy but...
I didn't care. It just tasted so nice.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... That was good... I think I like this one
the most."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What?! But that's not my cooking, Shido!	
Message	Kaguya	"What...? You're going to ignore the golden egg
of the Yamai Sisters?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Objection. I would say our cooking was better.	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I was too busy thinking about cooking... Maybe I
wasn't considering Shido-san eating it..."	
Message	Origami	"Figs and pineapple have digestive enzymes. Yogurt
has the effect of regulating the intestines. "	
Message	Origami	"I have been calculating Shido's caloric intake up
to today. However, I hadn't calculated the actual
dinner to include any unpredictable factors."	
Message	None	"(I feel for Origami's cooking, it wasn't a matter
of strategy...)"	
Message	Kurumi	"It's true that I wasn't thinking to that extent.
As much as I'd hate to admit it, maybe I have
lost."	
Message	Tohka	"I see. I now understand how I lost. Besides,
it looked delicious!"	
Message	Shido	But who made this?	
Message	Miku	"It wasn't me. If it matches your tastes,
darling... Could it be Kotori-chan?"	
Message	Kotori	No. It seems like Arusu made that.	
Message	Shido	"Arusu...? Come to think of it, she was in the
kitchen too... I didn't notice..."	
Message	None	(Well, it was chaotic in there.)	
Message	Shido	Then Arusu is the winner. So, where did she go?	
Message	Kotori	She's gone... Maybe she went out?	
Message	Shido	Alone? But it's late... I'm worried.	
Message	Kotori	It's fine. This is her world.	
Message	Shido	"Even so, I can't just leave her alone. I'll go
look for her."	
Message	Kotori	Okay. Then we'll be cleaning up.	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're not going to tell me I shouldn't go?	
Message	Kotori	"I just thought if it were you... you might have
the ability to show Arusu what she's looking
for..."	
Message	Shido	"What she's looking for... You know what? Well,
fine. I'll come right back as soon as I find her."	
Message	Kotori	"Okay, okay. Go already. You're so you.
Take care, Onii-chan."	
Message	Shido	Okay!
