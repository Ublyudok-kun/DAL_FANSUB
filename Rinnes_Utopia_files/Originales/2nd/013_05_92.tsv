Message	None	"(So in the end, everyone just hung out in my room,
while I... cleaned the living room alone.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, there you are.	
Message	Shido	Oh. What's up, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	N-Nothing. I was worried because I didn't see you.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I was just cleaning up. I'm almost done,
so don't worry, just go back to the room."	
Message	Tohka	O-Okay... I guess I will, then. But before that...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Tohka	I wanted to apologize...	
Message	Shido	Huh? About what?	
Message	Tohka	A-About the infirmary. I failed, right?	
Message	Shido	"No, don't worry about it. It was like a dream.
And I guess I was only feverish then."	
Message	Tohka	Really...? But...	
Message	Shido	Anyways, Tohka... Did you figure out what love is?	
Message	Tohka	No... not at all.	
Message	Shido	"I figured. Arusu claimed that she was able to
gather data, but... I'm worried about whether
it was enough."	
Message	Tohka	"Are you sure it's not because I failed? Maybe
that's why she still doesn't know..."	
Message	Shido	No... I don't think that's the case...	
Message	None	"Honestly, even if we were successful, I'm sure she
wouldn't have gotten it."	
Message	Tohka	"I-Is that so?
Hmm... I do not understand."	
Message	Shido	"Well, like I said, don't worry about it. Similar
things to today may happen again."	
Message	Tohka	R-Right. I'll try my best not to fail next time.	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Origami, what's up?	
Message	Origami	I wanted to ask you something.	
Message	Shido	What about?	
Message	Origami	"About the phenomenon that occurred after class.
She claimed, with that information, that she was
able to obtain data on how love grows."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... so she claims.	
Message	Origami	"What sort of data is it? I haven't
the slightest idea."	
Message	Shido	Me neither.	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Shido	"I was too busy being focused on my role
at the time..."	
Message	Origami	"Likewise. I didn't even question that I was
a student who was always in the infirmary."	
Message	Shido	"Well, since we were in the middle of it all, it's
hard to tell, but maybe for someone like Arusu
who was observing, she noticed something?"	
Message	Origami	"That is a possibility. If it's going to happen
again, maybe we will figure it out then."	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Shido? Let me help you... clean.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yoshino. Thank you so much.	
Message	Yoshino	N-No problem...	
Message	Shido	Oh, perfect timing.	
Message	Yoshino	...Huh? What is it?	
Message	Shido	How did it feel to be my older sister?	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...? Well, um...	
Message	Shido	"Just tell me what's on your mind. I mean, it was
all like a dream anyways."	
Message	Yoshino	Well... um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"You were happy to be able to talk to Shido-kun\na lot, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon...!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's great. I wonder if that was what Arusu
wanted to see..."	
Message	Yoshino	I... don't know...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry, I didn't mean for you to have to answer
that. It was really nice having you as an older
sister."	
Message	Yoshino	...! Well... um... that makes me... very happy.	
Message	Shido	"Another event like today's may happen in the
future. If it does, let's get through it together,
okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	...O-Okay. Thank... you.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, were you cleaning? Would you like me to help?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi cleaning, huh...? It's hard to imagine...	
Message	Kurumi	"My, how rude. I can do all the basic chores such
as cooking and laundry."	
Message	Shido	"Well, if Kurumin is using you as a base, that
makes sense."	
Message	Kurumi	"It would be nice if an opportunity arose where I
could show you."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that might be fun.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Then I look forward to showing you.	
Message	Shido	That... seems like it might be wrong.	
Message	Kotori	I'm going to put this cup here, okay?	
Message	Shido	Sure, that's fine.	
Message	Kotori	Anyways, Shido. You'd better be thinking.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Kotori	"Arusu, of course. What else would I be
talking about?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Sorry, judging from what Arusu was saying,
if we repeat what we did today, maybe
eventually..."	
Message	Kotori	"We can't always be on the receiving end of her
whims. And besides, how's she going to know what
love is by repeating what we did today?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah... You were a magical girl, after all...	
Message	Kotori	"Seriously... Why did Arusu set up a scenario like
that... That has nothing to do with love..."	
Message	Shido	"Maybe it was like, love and courage and whatnot...
That type of thing might have potential?"	
Message	Kotori	"It's a bug, is what it is. When we get back to the
real world, I'm going to cram the one responsible
for this in a magical girl get-up of their own."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha...	
Message	None	"(I don't know who's behind all this, but I'm going
to pray for their safety...)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Verification. May I put the cups here?	
Message	Shido	Sure. Thanks.	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe. Today was truly entertaining.	
Message	Shido	"I thought the reason we gathered was not to play,
though."	
Message	Kaguya	"I know that. We gathered to figure out how to lift
our curse in this world, right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Questionable. Do you think there will be
continuing situations where Kaguya and
Yuzuru are Shido's sisters?"	
Message	Shido	"Arusu said something like that. But I would assume
the next time would be a different situation."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph. Whatever it is, it's no match for us Yamai
sisters."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Kaguya said earlier that she was
extremely embarrassed."	
Message	Kaguya	"Because... I mean, I can't help it! I-I... we were
in bed... with Sh-Shido..."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I don't think I've ever been that nervous
before... Well, I guess don't let it bother
you...?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Offense. Are you suggesting that you don't care
about us?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No... That's not what I said. I mean, when we're
in that sort of state, it's different than usual."	
Message	Yuzuru	"...Agreed. If you put it that way, I guess you're
right..."	
Message	Shido	...Well, yeah.	
Message	Miku	Darling, do you want some help cleaning?	
Message	Shido	Oh... Uh, it's fine. I'm almost done.	
Message	Miku	"Aww, how unfortunate～ I wanted to keep acting like
your fiancée."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Well, that's too bad.	
Message	Miku	I mean, I still want to be your fiancée!	
Message	Shido	"I don't know. I'm sure Arusu's planning more
things, but it probably won't be the same
situation."	
Message	None	"(Or rather, I hope it's not. I feel like if that
continues, I'm not going to last.)"	
Message	Miku	"I see. Then next time, I want to be in a wedding
dress～"	
Message	Shido	That's not what we're doing this for!	
Message	Miku	"I know～ But you might as well have fun with it,
you know?"	
Message	Shido	You have a point. Miku, you're always so positive.	
Message	Miku	"Of course～ I am an idol on a mission to brighten
everyone's day～"	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Shido	Oh, is the girls' night over?	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. It's getting late, so we're calling it
a night."	
Message	Shido	"Then let's see everyone off to the door. But it is
pretty late. Everyone okay?"	
Message	Kotori	"I figured it's best to stay near each other while
we're in this world, so I'm having them stay in
the Spirit Mansion. That's what we talked about."	
Message	Shido	I see. That's a good idea.	
Message	None	"(Everyone at the Spirit Mansion, huh... That's
unexpected.)"	
Message	Kotori	Oh, I forgot to tell you.	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kotori	"While you were out, we got really pumped looking
for houses, so your room got a bit messy."	
Message	Shido	Can you seriously not?!	
Message	Kotori	"It's your fault that you walked out.
You asked for it."	
Message	Shido	Fine...	
Message	None	(Seems like I have more work to do... *sigh*)
