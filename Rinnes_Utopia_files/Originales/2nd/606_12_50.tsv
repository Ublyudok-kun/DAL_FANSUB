Message	Shido	All right, I should leave soon.	
Message	Kotori	"Huh, you're going out, Shido? I wanted you to go to
the market for me."	
Message	Shido	"Seriously, you have to stop treating me like your
servant. I'm going on a date with Kaguya and Yuzuru
today... It's my day off."	
Message	Kotori	Ah, that's right. Hmm... I see.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?	
Message	Kotori	"Nothingggg. Well, why don't you take good care of
them. THEY are your TWO adorable, adorable girlfriends,
aren't they?"	
Message	Shido	I-I know that. You don't have to tell me.	
Message	None	"(For some reason it feels so cold. But I decided that
I'm going to take care of Kaguya and Yuzuru. I'm not
going to let this get to me!)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, I'm on my way out. I can't let my adorable
girlfriends wait, right?"	
Message	Kotori	I see. Later. Oh... Shido. I have a favor to ask you.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it? Why are you all serious?	
Message	Kotori	"I want you to buy me pudding on the way back. I'll
let you choose the kind... but you should already
know."	
Message	Shido	Okay. Well, I'll be off, then!	
Message	Kotori	Byeee. Be home before dinner!	
Message	None	"(I think I heard Kotori laughing inside the house. Do
I look that weird today? Well... I guess I do.)"	
Message	Shido	"Ah. Maybe I'm nervous. Even after we started dating,
we've rarely been on dates on my days off."	
Message	None	"(Once I became conscious of it, I couldn't stop
thinking about it. But it's fine. I did come up with a
plan. It'll be fine... I think.)"	
Message	None	"(Well... no use in thinking about it now. Thanks to
Kotori, I got rid of my nerves a bit...)"	
Message	Shido	All right, I'm heading out!	
Message	Shido	"...I arrived over 30 minutes early. It's better than
being late, but if I wander around, it'll seem like I
feel bad about getting here too early."	
Message	Shido	I'm sure they aren't here yet.	
Message	Yuzuru	Calling... Shido.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Arrived. Sorry for the wait. Yuzuru left pretty
early... Have I made you wait?"	
Message	Shido	Oh no, I just got here...	
Message	None	"(Hm? Why does it seem like Yuzuru is out of breath?
Did she run?)"	
Message	Shido	"Did you run? It's earlier than our meeting time. You
didn't have to rush."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Negative. That's wrong. I saw that you were waiting,
so I just ran here."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. I see. Sorry for making you run.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Focused. Yuzuru was the one who ran, so it's not your
fault, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Thanks. Seriously, you're as cute as always,
Yuzuru."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Appreciation. Thank you. I'm happy to hear you say
that."	
Message	Shido	Ah. Hahaha.	
Message	None	"(I feel so uneasy. I feel like I can hear Kotori
laughing at me. Her voice is ringing in my ear.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come to think of it, is it just you today? Kaguya
isn't with you...?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Since it's a date, Kaguya suggested we
leave home separately."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, I see. But... wouldn't normal couples who live
together do that?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. But I do hear that the vibe is what's
important. And besides, you can pretty much say that
Yuzuru and Kaguya are dating as well."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... I guess since the three of us are dating,
you could interpret it that way..."	
Message	None	"(It seems a bit out there, but since we still have
time, we can just hang out. I'm sure she won't be too
late.)"	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru and I talked for about 20 minutes, but Kaguya
was still nowhere in sight.)"	
Message	Shido	"You think Kaguya is going to come on time? She knows
that you left the house already, right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Reminiscence. Right. I did tell her.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Yuzuru	Silence...	
Message	Shido	"...She won't be late, will she? I mean, she's the one
who suggested it, but she's going to be late?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Negative. I'm sure it'll be all right. See look, she's
arrived."	
Message	None	"(I looked toward where Yuzuru pointed, and indeed
saw Kaguya crossing the intersection.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"...Keke, I made you wait, Shido. Coming early and
waiting for your master... I certainly taught my
servant well."	
Message	Shido	Morning, Kaguya. You look adorable in your outfit.	
Message	Kaguya	Wha?!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Attention. Shido, Kaguya is blushing. Let's praise her
more and enjoy her reaction."	
Message	Kaguya	I-I'm not blushing! A-And what are you doing, Yuzuru?!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Monologue. Yuzuru will disappear into Shido's shadow
for a while. Kaguya, why don't you converse with Shido
for a bit?"	
Message	Shido	"Yuzuru, what are you doing? Ah... Well Kaguya, I guess
you left a little early."	
Message	Kaguya	"I mean it's a date. It's not nice to make you wait,
right Shido?"	
Message	None	"(I'm sure she knew that Yuzuru came before she did.
Well, I guess I shouldn't say that.)"	
Message	Shido	So you came early for me, Kaguya? Thanks.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph... It's only obvious. That's the role of a
master."	
Message	Shido	I see, that makes me happy.	
Message	Kaguya	H-Hey... Don't pet meeee...	
Message	Shido	You're cute, Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	Sh-Shut up...!	
Message	Shido	Oh, you don't want me to do it anymore?	
Message	Kaguya	Grr...	
Message	Yuzuru	"...Taunt. What's the matter, Kaguya? Yuzuru was
totally alone with Shido for 30 minutes."	
Message	Kaguya	"Wh-What did you say?! No, it's fine... I'm fine with
that!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yuzuru... It's not like we were doing anything.
You don't have to egg her on!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Unfortunate. I thought it would be fun seeing Kaguya
blush."	
Message	Kaguya	"Forget it!
"	
Message	Kaguya	Keke... All right, Shido. Why don't we head out?	
Message	Shido	Kaguya, you're so fast at changing the pace...	
Message	Kaguya	Shut up! Let's just go!	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Let's go Shido. Time is limited.	
Message	Shido	All right, leave it to me!	
Message	Shido	"So we're here, but... Are you guys okay with this
place? I mean, we can drop by here after school."	
Message	Kaguya	"I don't mind. Hehe... It makes me boil. I can do
whatever I please for as long as I want, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's however much our wallet will allow, but I
would say we have more time now to enjoy than if we
were to come here after school."	
Message	Yuzuru	Exaltation. This place does make me feel giddy.	
Message	Shido	I didn't expect that. You like the arcade too, Yuzuru?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Yuzuru and I are 2-in-1. Whatever Kaguya
likes, Yuzuru likes as well. And we can compete with
each other."	
Message	None	"(I see, come to think of it... I guess this place is
perfect for that.)"	
Message	Shido	All right, then let me join the battle today!	
Message	Kaguya	"Wh-What?! Shido, you're going to plunge yourself in
the midst of battle with the Yamais?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, is that not okay?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analysis. Depending on the results of the battle,
we were going to determine who could do
whatever they wanted to Shido."	
Message	Shido	I see.	
Message	None	"(Ah, so naturally I'm their prize. Well, I guess it's not
just today that they've done this.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Keke. No problem. The heavens smile upon me. I'm
going to compete with Shido and emerge victorious."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. The winner can do what they want with Shido
afterwards."	
Message	Shido	W-Well, if you guys are fine with that, then I'm okay.	
Message	Kaguya	Then it's set. The first battle will be... THAT!	
Message	None	(For the first competition, Kaguya chose...)	
Message	Shido	"A racing game, huh? Where we go inside the booth and
control the handles?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Indeed. For the Yamais as fast as a gale, this game is
nothing to us."	
Message	Shido	I see. So if you're going to tell me about it, then...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Of course, Kaguya Yamai will be your opponent. Sorry,
Yuzuru. It's decided that I will be victorious."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Cheering. Shido, good luck. You must not lose until
you compete with me."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha... Well, I'll do my best.	
Message	None	(And the fateful coin was put in!)	
Message	None	(The race began, and Kaguya started with a dash!)	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... What's the matter, Shido? The one who takes
control of the beginning will take control of the
race. This battle is pretty much mine."	
Message	Shido	*grunt* It's not over yet!	
Message	None	"(As Kaguya said, this game is great for competing.
It's hard to close the gap. As a result, any advantage
won in the beginning becomes significant.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Suggestion. Shido, don't give up. Attack Kaguya.	
Message	Shido	Got it. I'll aim for her rounding the corner!	
Message	Shido	I can do it!	
Message	Kaguya	KAKAKAKA! Futile attempt!	
Message	Shido	Damn, she blocked it!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analysis. Kaguya's car is accurately defending the
line you're trying to get in, Shido."	
Message	None	"(I didn't know Kaguya was this good. She must play
a lot of racing games.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Worried. Shido, at this rate...	
Message	Shido	No, I'm fine. This is all part of my plan...	
Message	Kaguya	Wha...t?! Shido, what did you just say?	
Message	Shido	"Hehehe. Just what I said. Now let's go to the next
corner!"	
Message	Kaguya	*grunt* Do you have a plan of attack? I won't let you!	
Message	None	"(Kaguya blocked the road once again. But... that's
fine.)"	
Message	Shido	"To be in the front always means you're facing
pressure. If you try to block the road..."	
Message	Kaguya	"Wh-What do you mean? What is Shido talking about?
*gasp* Oh, no! Did I cut my wheels too much?!"	
Message	None	"(Yup, these kinds of accidents occur often. Kaguya's
car started to fumble.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confident! Shido, now's your chance! Turn the handle
to the right!"	
Message	Shido	MINEEEE!	
Message	Kaguya	Th-This can't be. I...	
Message	None	"(Kaguya lost speed due to the slip, so if I go with
it, it'll be difficult to close the distance. I am
always a safe driver. Kaguya, it's game over for you.)"	
Message	Kaguya	What? This can't be. How could I lose so easily...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understand. Shido, you purposefully let Kaguya gain
an advantage in the beginning, didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. In a game like this, you have to watch out for
any potential slips. It's difficult to handle the
turns consistently, so it's easy to change the tide."	
Message	Kaguya	"I see. That's why you let me go ahead, and then
you were banking on the final curve. *grunt*... And
I totally fell for it."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Pointer. Kaguya, you asked for a rematch twice and
you've lost a total of three times. So I don't think
his tactic is even an issue."	
Message	Kaguya	"*grunt*...! Shut up, shut up! Shido, Yuzuru is bullying
meeee..."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. Well then...	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. Yuzuru's turn next.	
Message	Shido	Got it. So... What do you want to play?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Selection. I've already decided. The stage of our
battle will be that."	
Message	None	(Yuzuru pointed at―!)	
Message	Shido	Air hockey, huh? This is another classic.	
Message	Kaguya	"Yuzuru, I won't let you lose. You bear the Yamai name,
and you will defeat Shido. It's a must!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Undertaking. Leave it to me. We Yamais are Hurricane
Children who control the wind. I will never lose in
anything with the name "air"."	
Message	None	"(Uh... wouldn't you say air hockey has nothing to do
with that?)"	
Message	None	"(Well, whatever... So our air hockey battle will now
begin!)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Defeat. I'm sorry, Kaguya. I lost.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't blame you. I mean, I have longer arms
than you do, Yuzuru, so I have a wider range I can
cover."	
Message	None	"(I'm also not going to tell her that her chest was in
the way. Not that I was watching...)"	
Message	Kaguya	Yuzuru, I had faith in you...!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Guilty. I apologize, Kaguya. The Yamai Sisters have
been completely defeated..."	
Message	Shido	Mm. So what becomes of your battle?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hm. Today's battle is a tie... Oh wait, no, that's not
right."	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. I know. Today's winner is Shido.	
Message	Kaguya	"*grunt*... Very well. Shido, you have the right to do
as you please with the Yamai Sisters. Feel free to do
whatever you want."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh, I see. Hmm... then what should I have you
two do...?"	
Message	Kaguya	"*grunt* Shido... What kind of disgrace do you plan for
the Yamais...?!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Resolve. I am prepared to do anything, no matter how
embarrassing it may be. I won't be defeated by your
punishment."	
Message	None	(What is up with them...)	
Message	Shido	You guys... Oh, I know. Let's do that.	
Message	Kaguya	That's...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confirming. Those are photo stickers. You're okay with
just that, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I want to have memories from today, so I
thought we could take them together. Is that okay?"	
Message	Kaguya	"That is one giant projection machine. Very well, I
shall acquiesce."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Servile. If you've decided Shido, of course I won't
have an issue with it."	
Message	None	"(...I'm so glad. Seems like I was able to get away
with it.)"	
Message	None	"(All right, I need to get inside and pay. But I don't
really know how to work the machine.)"	
Message	Shido	Do you think this is good?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. It seems like we will be maneuvering
that button. You've not done much of these either,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I feel like girls do this more. Guys wouldn't go
unless they had a girlfriend."	
Message	Kaguya	"I see. Then... From now on, we will do it as much as
you want."	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. Let's make lots of memories, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Oh, for sure. All right... Let's take the photo.	
Message	Kaguya	Hm. This image lacks playfulness.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. I mean this is Shido's prize, so we need
to make it more of a prize."	
Message	Shido	"What are you two talking about? Let's take the next
shot."	
Message	Kaguya	Hmm... Then let's go with that. Shido.	
Message	Yuzuru	Smirk. Please take the photo.	
Message	None	(What... are they talking about?)	
Message	Shido	Oh well. Here I go, guys.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Wh-What...	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe. Perfect. Shido, that was your prize from
earlier. Accept it."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Gift. This is a victory kiss from the Yamai Sisters.
Please accept it."	
Message	Shido	Y-You guys...	
Message	None	"(Gosh, I can never let my guard down when I'm with
them.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh! We can doodle on it! Heh... Then I will show you
what the Devil King's writing looks like."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. Then Yuzuru will handle this one. Here
you go, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	Gosh... Okay, fine.	
Message	None	(And so I saved the photo stickers with their kiss.)	
Message	None	"(As I doodled with Kaguya and Yuzuru, I was thinking
how nice it would be to have fun days like this
continue on forever.)"
