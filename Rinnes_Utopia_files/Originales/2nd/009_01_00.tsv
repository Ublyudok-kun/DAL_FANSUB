Message	Shido	Mm...mmmm... Hm? It's... morning?	
Message	None	"(Huh? When did I fall asleep? I feel like I was
with everyone just now...)"	
Message	None	"(That's right, I entered a virtual world to test
out a game. Then I met a mysterious girl... Arusu.
And then everyone was there, and...)"	
Message	Shido	"Wait... Oh, that must have been a dream... Right.
There's no way that crazy thing could have been
real."	
Message	Shido	"It sure was a weird dream... Guess I should go
make some breakfast."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Good morning, Kotori. What's the matter? You seem
to be in a bad mood right from the start."	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Uh... Arusu?	
Message	Arusu	Yes.	
Message	None	(...So it wasn't a dream.)	
Message	Shido	"Huh? But why is it morning? My memory of yesterday
only goes up to the afternoon..."	
Message	Arusu	"At that point, I restarted the world. Currently
it's morning because that is the default setting."	
Message	Kotori	"We basically started a new game. We're now at
Game Start, Day 1."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	So, why are you in our house?	
Message	Arusu	"To observe Shido Itsuka. So I can observe love and
people growing closer."	
Message	Kotori	"So you're keeping watch over Shido? Fine, got it.
While you're doing that, let's get going with
Arusu's big plan."	
Message	Kotori	"Then Shido, I guess we can start off with you...
making breakfast."	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. We can eat in the virtual world, right?
I'll get it ready now."	
Message	Shido	"I was curious about what was inside the fridge,
but it looks like I did some grocery shopping.
I don't remember getting these..."	
Message	Kotori	"The contents of our fridge aren't being uploaded
to the game in real time. I think they were just
randomly prepared."	
Message	Arusu	"I didn't change anything else other than summoning
characters for Shido Itsuka to love."	
Message	Shido	"Attainable characters, was it? That's what you
called them... Then Kotori's also—"	
Message	Kotori	"I-I'm the one responsible for the Fraxinus and by
extension, the simulator...!"	
Message	Arusu	"Kotori Itsuka was set to be an attainable
character from the beginning."	
Message	Kotori	"Ngh... Y-You said you didn't change any other
settings, right?"	
Message	Arusu	Yes. This world was originally designed for that.	
Message	Kotori	"Not surprising... There are all these typical gal
game tropes in here."	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, when I first logged in,
everyone bumped into me with toast in
their mouths..."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, they were NPCs. But I see. The general
outline hasn't changed."	
Message	Shido	"Uh, Kotori. I know it's important to figure it all
out, but let's get breakfast over with first. The
toast and sunny-side up eggs are getting cold."	
Message	Kotori	You're right... Thank you for the meal.	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	None	"(Arusu is staring at me. I guess she's already
starting her observations. I don't think eating
breakfast has anything to do with love...)"	
Message	Shido	"Arusu, why don't you eat too? Well, it's nothing
special. Just toast, eggs, and salad."	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. So I should do the same as Kotori Itsuka?
This is the first time I've done something
like this."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Well I guess so, since you're an AI Spirit.	
Message	None	"(Arusu awkwardly picked up a piece of toast and
examined it. So she really is eating a meal for
the first time.)"	
Message	None	"(Nice... The toast is perfect and the eggs are
pretty good. Arusu is copying us and eating well.)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, so now that breakfast is over, what should
we do next?"	
Message	Kotori	"We have no option but to behave like we usually
do. We'll go to school and attend classes."	
Message	Shido	"That's all? This is a game world, right? It
doesn't feel like it at all."	
Message	None	"(Breakfast tasted so real, even down to how
crisp the lettuce was. It's hard to believe a
program replicated that.)"	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. But we have no choice but to abide
by her rules. Then Shido, it's best you live
normally in this world. Events will pop up."	
Message	Shido	Events...	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Kotori	"If what she said is true, and this world isn't
much different from normal, your life will
basically be a working gal game."	
Message	Kotori	"Well... Guess it's the best environment to find
out what love is."	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	"Love... But this is a gal game. Would you actually
find real love in a place like this...?"	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. It's a misconception that love's not real
in a gal game... I think. I mean, what's the point
in complaining about it now?"	
Message	Shido	You have a point there.	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Do you want more toast?	
Message	Arusu	...Yes.	
Message	None	"(I no longer felt her gaze on me. She seems to be
totally into the toast.)"	
Message	Shido	"Be sure to eat the eggs and salad too, all right?
You can stack the sunny-side up on the toast if
you want. It's good that way, too."	
Message	Arusu	Understood... I will give it a try.	
Message	Kotori	"*Sigh*... Luckily, she doesn't seem to want to
hurt us at this moment."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I agree.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you're easy on girls, so I don't trust
your judgement. Since we can't find a way out, if
there even is one, we've no choice but to comply."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. Anyways... What kind of life will
this gal game be?"	
Message	Kotori	"Beats me. I don't know the particulars of the
events. But I don't think it's that different from
your daily life."	
Message	Kotori	Your life is pretty much a screaming gal game.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not true...	
Message	None	"(...I guess I do remember Tonomachi saying
something like that to me.)"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways, just be your usual self and don't think
about it. I'm sure something will happen whether
you like it or not."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Got it.	
Message	Arusu	*Nom, nom*...	
Message	Shido	Arusu... seems like a free spirit now.	
Message	Kotori	"What are you talking about? She's been like this
from the get-go."	
Message	Shido	Well, you have a point...
