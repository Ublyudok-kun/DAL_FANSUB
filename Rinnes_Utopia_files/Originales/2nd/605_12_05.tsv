Message	Shido	Grrrr...	
Message	Shido	...Damn it, I can't finish.	
Message	None	(I was in my classroom after school holding my head.)	
Message	None	"(I've been staring at my desk for the past 30 minutes
groaning, but I can't see the end of it. I'm sure if
someone were to see me, I'd look really suspicious.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, if I didn't have to do this, I'd want to hurry
up and go home, but..."	
Message	None	(Of course no one responded to my mutterings.)	
Message	Shido	"And besides, "Events that occurred today"? It's the
same class! As usual!"	
Message	None	"(This time, I decided to take things out on the desk,
knowing nothing was going to change.)"	
Message	Shido	...It's really sad that I'm just doing stuff like this.	
Message	Shido	*sigh*...	
Message	None	(My sigh was engulfed by the empty classroom walls.)	
Message	Shido	Man, even study hall would be better at this rate.	
Message	Shido	"There's nothing for me to write in the day duty
journal..."	
Message	None	"(Even though I spoke aloud, no one was listening.
Tama-chan... I mean, Okamine-sensei, seems to be in
the middle of a teacher's conference.)"	
Message	Shido	"Man. Tohka and the others went home already. I'm
bored."	
Message	None	"(Being left behind with no one to talk to is tough. I
can't get my mind off of things or get any hints.)"	
Message	None	"(So it'd be better to go to study hall where all I
have to do is listen to a lecture.)"	
Message	Kotori	Uh, is this it?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	None	(I heard a familiar voice.)	
Message	None	(No, it can't be. She wouldn't be here.)	
Message	Kotori	Oh, there you are. Shido, what are you doing? Ugh.	
Message	Shido	Huh? S-Seriously, Kotori, is that you?	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe. I'm here.	
Message	Shido	"What are you doing, Kotori? You promised you'd be
waiting at the school gate."	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh, how rude. It's because you took forever. I got
tired of waiting, so I came to see you."	
Message	Kotori	"I asked Tohka and the others on their way home and
they told me you were in the classroom."	
Message	Shido	"But technically, outsiders can't be here without
permission. I hope you explained yourself to someone."	
Message	Kotori	Now, now. Don't sweat the small things.	
Message	Shido	Hey...	
Message	None	"(Look at her. Sticking her tongue out, acting all cute
to try and hide things...)"	
Message	Kotori	"How much time are you spending on that journal?
Just hurry up and write something to finish it
already."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah but... If I could do that, I wouldn't be taking
so long here."	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh, you're spending so much time on this... Can't
believe that I wasted any time worrying about you."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you were worried about me?	
Message	Kotori	"Huh?! O-Of course not...!
"	
Message	Kotori	Well... I take it back.	
Message	None	"(Kotori blushed and pouted, looking away. She's so
weak against things like this.)"	
Message	None	"(But thanks to her, I was able to switch on my
willpower.)"	
Message	Shido	Hang on. I'll finish it now.	
Message	Kotori	Kaaay.	
Message	None	(Kotori looked around the classroom intently.)	
Message	Kotori	Ah. So this is your classroom, huh...	
Message	Kotori	Is this Tohka's seat?	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	And that's Origami Tobiichi's?	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Kotori	"Ah, so you have pretty girls on both sides. Flowers in
both hands."	
Message	Shido	...You think so?	
Message	None	"(I gave a suspicious look and Kotori giggled. Kotori
should know that I'm always being sucked into their
ego fights.)"	
Message	Kotori	I seeee. Ohhhh. Uh-huhhh.	
Message	None	"(She looked at the podium, the window, the locker in
the back, and eventually sat in Tohka's seat.)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido～	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	I'm boreeed.	
Message	Shido	It hasn't even been five minutes!	
Message	Kotori	Well, I'm bored. I can't help it. Give me attention.	
Message	Shido	As much as I want to, I have to finish this journal.	
Message	None	"(I want to hurry up and finish so we can go home.
Now that my brain is working again, I wished she
wouldn't get in my way.)"	
Message	Kotori	"If you're not going to give me attention, I'm going to
play tricks on you."	
Message	Shido	T-Tricks?	
Message	None	"(She spoke in a sweet voice all of a sudden, and my
heart skipped a beat. Kotori smirked and went around
me.)"	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe. YAH...	
Message	Kotori	Guess who?	
Message	Shido	"Whoa. It's dark all of a sudden. Who could it be～
...Kotori, it's obviously going to be you!"	
Message	Kotori	Awww. You caught me.	
Message	Shido	Catch you? That isn't the issue.	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, you're so boring, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"I totally went along with your joke, though. Anyways,
stop distracting me!"	
Message	Kotori	Okay, okay, fine.	
Message	None	"(Kotori pouted and fell silent. But it only lasted for
a moment. She leaned towards me.)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido, push your chair out a bit.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Why?	
Message	Kotori	Just do it.	
Message	None	"(I just did as she asked, leaving a space between my
body and my desk.)"	
Message	None	(Kotori dove in without hesitation.)	
Message	Kotori	Yah.	
Message	Shido	What the heck are you doing?!	
Message	None	(Why was she on my lap, facing me?!)	
Message	None	(She had her arms around me as she sat...!)	
Message	Shido	Get off, Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	But Shido, you won't look at me at all.	
Message	Shido	That makes no sense!	
Message	Kotori	Please, Shido. Look at me?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	(Kotori said it in the sweetest voice.)	
Message	Kotori	Tee-hee ☆	
Message	None	"(She cocked her small head and made sound effects.
She poked my cheeks with her fingers.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa...	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, why are you so turned off... It's me. Of course
no matter what I do, I'll be cute. Be honest."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(My cheeks just twitched. I realized at a time like
this, even if she flirts with me, I learned.... that
it is a little annoying.)"	
Message	None	"(It's one of those situations. The more attention I
give her, the more it escalates. It'll never end.)"	
Message	None	(Argh, just ignore her.)	
Message	Kotori	Shido?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Hey Shido?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Shido.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Grr...	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, Shido. I said, Shido. Shido. HEY, HEY, HEY,
SHIDO, SHIDO, SHIDO, HEY, SHIDO!"	
Message	Shido	SHUT UPPPP!	
Message	Shido	What do you want to do? Destroy Gestalt?!	
Message	Kotori	Wow, you know that word? You sure are a nerd.	
Message	Shido	I won't deny it! But just shut up!	
Message	Kotori	"I mean, I came all the way here, and just waiting is
boring!"	
Message	Shido	"But if that's the reason why we're going home late,
what's the point of..."	
Message	Kotori	Even so!	
Message	Shido	ARGH!	
Message	None	"(...I don't think I can just ignore Kotori. What do I
do...?)"	
Choice		Continue working	
Choice		Poke fun at her	
Message	Shido	"Okay, fine. Then I'm going to continue writing in the
journal. So just stay calm."	
Message	Kotori	Fine. I guess I'll have to manage.	
Message	Shido	Why are you acting all high and mighty?	
Message	Shido	Anyways, let me finish this up. Don't get in my way.	
Message	Kotori	Okay, okay.	
Message	None	(I totally can't trust her...)	
Message	None	"(At this rate, I'll never finish. I have no choice. I
guess I'll just have to write something random.)"	
Message	Shido	"Uh... "Seems like there are more detailed subjects
during class―"."	
Message	Kotori	―Shido, you spelled it wrong.	
Message	None	(Kotori suddenly pointed it out.)	
Message	Kotori	"Detailed. It's spelled "t-a-i-l". I bet you anything
you can't even spell girlfriend. Ugh, I can't believe
it."	
Message	Shido	Shut up! It was just a mistake!	
Message	None	"(Gosh, she's just saying whatever she wants! I fixed
the spelling error and Kotori gave a victorious
snort.)"	
Message	Shido	"Damn it... Uh... "So It's getting a little colder, so I
want to try not to get sick, but―""	
Message	Kotori	"Hey Shido. Don't use "so" twice in one sentence.
Do you even know how to live? Do you want me to
rearrange your bones so that you can feel alive?"	
Message	Shido	Don't say such scary things!	
Message	None	"(How does she go from talking about grammar to
something so harmful?! Kotori's the same as usual.)"	
Message	Shido	Gosh. Uh...	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido. Your handwriting's so messy.	
Message	Shido	That's just being rude!	
Message	None	"(I understand her correcting my spelling and grammar,
but messy handwriting is not a mistake!)"	
Message	Kotori	"Now, now. Hurry up and fill it in. Seriously, you
can't do anything without me."	
Message	None	"(Damn it... She's acting like she's all that. At this
rate, as her brother and her boyfriend, my pride will
be hurt. I need to teach her a lesson...)"	
Message	Shido	"Kotori. You said you're going to stay like this until
I'm done, right?"	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Yeah I said that.	
Message	Shido	All right, then.	
Message	None	(I smirked and opened my legs wide.)	
Message	Kotori	H-Hey, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	Don't move. You want to stay like this, right?	
Message	Kotori	N-No! I can't close my legs!	
Message	None	"(If I do that, that means Kotori's legs would widen
with mine. Since she's stuck on me, she won't be
able to close them. I have more power in my legs.)"	
Message	Kotori	I-It'll show! My underwear will show!	
Message	None	"(Kotori rushed to hold down her skirt. It's true. If I
spread my legs this wide, she will have to be
careful.)"	
Message	None	"(But I won't see it, and there's no one around, so I
feel like she shouldn't care too much.)"	
Message	Shido	Then I'll do this next.	
Message	None	(I grabbed Kotori's legs and then shook the chair.)	
Message	Kotori	Hey...!	
Message	Kotori	HAHHHHHH!	
Message	None	Kotori screamed and grabbed onto me.	
Message	Kotori	"You idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you thinking?! What
are you going to do if I fall?!"	
Message	Shido	It'll be fine. I think.	
Message	Kotori	I THINK?! That's not good!	
Message	Shido	All right, then let's do a little more.	
Message	Kotori	NOOOOOOOO!	
Message	Kotori	Stop it, Shido! Please, stop!	
Message	None	"(I saw faint tears in Kotori's eyes. Maybe I went too
far...)"	
Message	Shido	"...Sorry. I went too far. But will you promise me
you'll be quiet?"	
Message	Kotori	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	Very well.	
Message	None	(Kotori's cute when she's this honest.)	
Message	Shido	Kotori, I'll play with you, so will you do me a favor?	
Message	Kotori	Hm? Sure. What is it?	
Message	Shido	...Let me see your underwear.	
Message	Kotori	Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!	
Message	None	"(Kotori looked shocked. She wasn't expecting that
from me at all.)"	
Message	Shido	"If you don't want to, then get off. Those are your
choices. Let's make the conditions fair."	
Message	None	"(I'm going to use random reasoning to crush all her
attempts of escape. How does she like that?! I'm sure
she has no choice but to get away.)"	
Message	None	"(I feel like I've lost the bare minimum of dignity
that I had as both a person and a brother, but I'm
just not going to think about that for now.)"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	"(She's faltering. I don't blame her. Don't force
yourself, and just get off.)"	
Message	Kotori	...You wanna see it that bad?	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	"(I wasn't expecting that answer and I was confused.
Kotori looked at me with puppy dog eyes.)"	
Message	Kotori	I'm asking you if you want to see my underwear that badly...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Huh? Um, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"My skirt is a little short today, so... I think if its from
behind, you can see my underwear."	
Message	None	(WHAT THE?!)	
Message	None	"(It's true that Kotori's skirt was short. And to top
it off, she was sitting on my lap with her legs
spread.)"	
Message	None	"(Her back was defenseless. Depending on the angle,
you might be able to see it clearly...)"	
Message	Kotori	If it's you, Shido... I can show you.	
Message	Shido	GUO...!	
Message	None	(Kotori whispered in my ears with warm breath.)	
Message	Kotori	"You wanna see it? Are you okay with turning into a
pervert, looking at your girlfriend's underwear
in an empty classroom?"	
Message	Shido	W-Well...	
Message	Kotori	"You don't have to say a thing. I'm embarrassed... but
if it's for you, I don't mind."	
Message	Shido	W-Wait, wait, wait!	
Message	None	"(Just as Kotori reached for the corner of her skirt, I
couldn't take it anymore and stopped her.)"	
Message	Shido	"C-Calm down Kotori! Even if we're dating, there are
some things that are inappropriate―"	
Message	Kotori	I win.	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	"Kotori had her prim expression back as she stared at
me."	
Message	Kotori	"You're so dumb. You tried to say something weird so
you'd distract me, huh? I won't fall for that."	
Message	Kotori	Or... Were you really hoping to see something?	
Message	Shido	Idiot! O-Of course not!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, I wonder.	
Message	None	"(*grunt* She sees right through me... Kotori was one
step above me.)"	
Message	Kotori	Hurry up and write it. I wanna hurry home.	
Message	Shido	G-Got it.	
Message	None	"(I guess I was dancing in the palm of Kotori's
hand...)"	
Message	Shido	It's late.	
Message	Kotori	It's because you were messing around, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you were the one that got in the way and came
to my school. That was a part of it, right?"	
Message	Kotori	Tee-hee.	
Message	None	"(By the time we left the school gates, it had been
about 20 minutes after we submitted the journal.)"	
Message	None	"(In the end Kotori was caught by Tama-chan, a.k.a.
Okamine-sensei. She said she respected her for
coming to pick me up, but she still lectured us.)"	
Message	Kotori	But it was fun. I was able to see your classroom.	
Message	Shido	You satisfied?	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah... But considering that I can't be your
classmate, I felt a little lonely."	
Message	None	"(I put my hand on Kotori's head. She looked at me,
confused.)"	
Message	None	(But then she smiled.)	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to be my classmate. You're my adorable
girlfriend."	
Message	Kotori	...!	
Message	None	"(Kotori look dumbfounded with her mouth half-open.
But the next moment, she turned a fiery red.)"	
Message	Kotori	"S-S-S-Say that all you want, but I won't fall for it! I'm
totally going to remember that you made me wait!"	
Message	Kotori	It's all your fault for taking your time!	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay.	
Message	Kotori	Hey, are you listening to me, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, yeah. Let's make Hamburg steak for dinner.	
Message	Kotori	Y-You're totally trying to change the subject!	
Message	Shido	I'll make some salad and eggs with it.	
Message	Kotori	I never asked for that!	
Message	None	"(As she made a fuss, we went home. Kotori and I were
in our element like this.)"
