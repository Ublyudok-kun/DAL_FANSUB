Message	Maria	This is an amusement park...	
Message	Shido	How is it? Much crazier in real life, right?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Observation. Why are you acting so proud,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Leave me alone.	
Message	Maria	"There are many people, and it is very lively.
Everyone is smiling, almost encouraging me
to smile myself."	
Message	Shido	"That's a good thing, Maria. Your smile is sure
to make others smile too. It's contagious.
Make your happiness known to the world."	
Message	Maria	"The more people smile, the more fun it is
for everyone else, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, I think so... When Shido-san smiles,
I feel... very happy."	
Message	Maria	"I understand what you said, Yoshino. I am
the same."	
Message	Yoshino	...Huh? Ah, u-um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Good grief, Maria-chan. Saying you're the\nsame as Yoshino. Does that mean, with Shido,\nyou also—"	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon!	
Message	Maria	...? Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	No, nothing. Don't worry about it.	
Message	None	"(This is how it always goes with Yoshino
and Yoshinon.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Proposal. Instead of chatting, we should head
to an attraction. In all truth, no amount of time
is adequate when visiting an amusement park."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, yeah! I agree! Let's get on with it!	
Message	Shido	All right. Then, where should we go first?	
Message	Maria	"You are right. First... Why not the haunted
house?"	
Message	Kotori	...Whaa!	
Message	Kotori	"Th-The haunted house, huh? I... I just
remembered something I have to do,
so I'll wait here!"	
Message	Shido	Come on...	
Message	Maria	Do you not enjoy haunted houses, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	That's not... true.	
Message	Shido	"Ahh, Maria. Let's forget it. You see, Kotori
hates scary things."	
Message	Maria	"I see. It would be prudent for us to avoid it
then."	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine! It's fine, so go ahead! You want
to go, right Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"However, with the objective of traveling
as a group..."	
Message	Shido	"Maria. Listen to Kotori. In exchange, we'll
be able to go wherever she wants next."	
Message	Maria	But...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Proposal. I will remain behind as well. We
cannot leave Kotori alone."	
Message	Shido	"Would you be okay with that, Yuzuru?
Is it possible you're not good with
haunted houses either?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Denial. In fact, it is preposterous to suggest
anything could frighten me. On the contrary,
I would not want to be disappointed by it."	
Message	Shido	I'm not sure I believe you...	
Message	Origami	"Yuzuru, with that attitude, you'll surely miss
out."	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. Lady Origami, what do you mean?	
Message	Origami	"The essence of a haunted house, sometimes
known as a horror house, is of men and women
being thrown into the dark."	
Message	None	(I don't think that's true in the slightest!)	
Message	Yoshino	A dark place... Kind of scary.	
Message	Yoshinon	"I'm picking up what Origami-chan's putting\ndown. It's dark and scary, meaning there's a\nchance to cling onto someone, you know?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Forgetfulness. I hadn't properly trained
myself to recall the romantic potential.
Intriguing argument, Lady Origami."	
Message	Shido	"I feel like you're off base, but... What's the
plan, Yuzuru? Will you come after all?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Refusal. I still intend to speak casually with
Kotori. It might be too early. What do you say
to ice cream, Kotori?"	
Message	Kotori	"Ooooh! That sounds yummy! You guys have
all the fun you want, Onii-chan."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, you two. We'll get going, so wait here.	
Message	Yuzuru	Understood. Leave it to us.	
Message	Shido	"It's even darker than I thought it'd be.
Maria, where are you?"	
Message	Maria	"I am here. I see why it is called a haunted
house. They lower both the lighting and
the internal temperature to stage terror."	
Message	None	(Maria looks more curious than scared.)	
Message	Shido	What about you, Yoshino? You okay?	
Message	Yoshino	"...Y-Yes! I'm... fine, somehow. But Shido-san,
is it okay if I hold your hand?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh, my hand? Yeah, sure. It's dim and
dangerous in here."	
Message	Yoshinon	"All right. Atta girl, Yoshino! Subtly getting\nhim to hold your hand."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-It's not like that, Yoshinon. This is
because I cannot see well..."	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Maria	Shido. Will you grab my hand as well?	
Message	Shido	Hm? All right. Here.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Thank you.	
Message	Shido	"It's hard to walk like this, but oh well.
Let's go."	
Message	Origami	...Wait.	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Origami?	
Message	Origami	"I am frightened too. I want you to hold my
hand."	
Message	Shido	"Wait, Origami. I don't have an open hand.
On top of that, you don't look scared at all."	
Message	Origami	That's untrue. I am shivering heavily from fear.	
Message	Shido	"G-Gotcha... I mean, it's physically impossible
to hold your hand, you see?"	
Message	Origami	There is a place I can grab aside from your hand.	
Message	Shido	"Gah, hey! Don't grab ahold of my neck!
Pick a sleeve or my back or something, all
right? Just don't grab anything weird."	
Message	Origami	"What do you mean by weird? I do not
understand, so please describe it in detail.
I wouldn't mind an example as well."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, that's enough talking! Come on,
let's go."	
Message	None	(...Sheesh, it's dark in here.)	
Message	Maria	Kya!	
Message	Shido	Ooh...	
Message	Yoshino	Eeeek!	
Message	Shido	Everything is staged well...	
Message	Shido	Whoaaaack!	
Message	None	"(Urgh. I didn't think they'd get me a third
time. I let my guard down. I was so shocked
I let go of their hands.)"	
Message	Maria	Sh-Shido?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...?	
Message	None	(Um, whose hand should I grab first...?)	
Choice		Go to Maria.	
Choice		Go to Yoshino.	
Choice		Head through the center.	
Message	None	(Maria should be right this way...)	
Message	Shido	Maria, are you okay?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I am fine. I was merely startled by
the loud noise."	
Message	Shido	I see. Then, here.	
Message	Maria	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	Then, next is... Heeey, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	...Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	She sounds close. Yoshino, you there?	
Message	Yoshino	Right here...	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's good. You okay?	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, I'm sorry... Yoshinon disappeared, so...
I was panicking."	
Message	Shido	What?! Do you know where she went last?	
Message	Yoshino	Ah, um... Origami-san assisted me.	
Message	Shido	I see. Thanks, Origami.	
Message	Origami	"It is in my nature to support you, Shido.
I always have night-vision goggles on
standby for times like these."	
Message	Shido	Do you always carry those around?	
Message	None	"(Perhaps that was a question better left
unanswered.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ah, man. I gotta thank you too. Thanks,\nOrigami-chan. Almost got separated from\nYoshino back there."	
Message	None	"(There was a time when Yoshino had
lost Yoshinon and lost control of her
Spirit powers. It was dangerous...)"	
Message	Shido	Really. Thanks, Origami.	
Message	Origami	...It is nothing.	
Message	None	(I'll head left. Yoshino should be this way.)	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, are you okay? Hmm?	
Message	None	"(Feels like I stepped on something...
What's down here?)"	
Message	None	(Hm? This shape...)	
Message	Shido	This is...! It's Yoshinon! Which must mean...	
Message	Yoshino	"W-Waaaah, Yoshinon...? Yoshinon, where
are you?"	
Message	None	"(This is bad! Without Yoshinon with her,
Yoshino is going to panic!)"	
Message	Shido	"Calm down, Yoshino! Yoshinon's with me.
Don't move, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Here. It's all right now, Yoshino. Yoshinon's
here. See? Can you tell?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Ahh, Yoshinon... Shido-san... I... I...
I was scared."	
Message	None	"(For Yoshino, losing Yoshinon must be
scarier than seeing ghosts.)"	
Message	Shido	Ohh, there there. It's okay.	
Message	Yoshino	*sniff*...Yes. Thank you.	
Message	Maria	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hey, you all right, Maria?	
Message	Maria	Shido, you... No, never mind.	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Maria?	
Message	Maria	I told you. Never mind.	
Message	Shido	U-Um, okay. Grab my hand.	
Message	Maria	Okay.	
Message	None	(Right or left? No. I'll go through the middle.)	
Message	Shido	Anyone there?	
Message	Shido	I-I feel something soft. Could this be...?	
Message	Origami	Shido, are we doing this here?	
Message	Shido	Origami?!	
Message	Origami	"If you shout, the others will notice, but I do
not mind if you want to be seen, Shido."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...?	
Message	Maria	Shido, what exactly are you doing?	
Message	Shido	"It isn't what it looks like! It was an accident.
That's right. An accident! Nothing more.
Come on. Let's go. Keep going, okay?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Sighting. It looks like they've emerged.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It ended up taking a while. Sorry to
keep you waiting."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Denial. No need to apologize. Kotori and I
took our time acquainting ourselves. The
soft serve was delicious too."	
Message	Kotori	Yup, yup! Such soft and creamy soft serve!	
Message	Shido	"I see. Good to hear. Okay, time to go some
place where you two can join."	
Message	Yuzuru	Proposal. How about that?	
Message	Shido	The coffee cups, huh? How about we do that?	
Message	Maria	They really do look like giant coffee cups.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's what they are. You sit inside
the cup and spin it around."	
Message	Maria	"I know of this. However, I am curious as to
why they chose coffee cups as a vessel."	
Message	Shido	"Overseas, they call these teacups, so I'm not
sure. Maybe they wanted to give it an olden
feel?"	
Message	Maria	I see. It makes sense now.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, hey. Shido-kun. Shido-kun."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's up, Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san, um... I...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Just be honest, Yoshino. Yoshino's probably\ngonna get dizzy, so she'll sit this one out."	
Message	Shido	"Ohh. I know how bad dizziness can get.
It was noisy earlier too. Take a breather,
Yoshino. You gonna be okay alone?"	
Message	Origami	"Then, I will stay behind this time too. The
four of you can go."	
Message	Shido	You sure, Origami?	
Message	Origami	No problem. Besides, it's good to rest.	
Message	Shido	I'd rather us all go, but okay. We'll hop in.	
Message	None	"(As Maria, Kotori, Yuzuru and I sat inside of
a cup, the central mechanism started to spin
slowly as the music played.)"	
Message	Shido	"Have you ever ridden on something like
this, Yuzuru?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Recollection. I recall one battle with Kaguya.
We competed to see who could spin the most
until the music stopped."	
Message	Shido	Ahh. I know what you're talking about.	
Message	None	"(As a kid, I always tried spinning it as fast
as I could.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Regret. After we exited the attraction, our
semicircular canals were too impacted,
leaving us unable to determine who won."	
Message	Shido	That sounds... troublesome.	
Message	Maria	"Shido, the floor is spinning in time with the
music. Almost like we're dancing."	
Message	Shido	"It's super fun, isn't it? But Maria, what Yuzuru
touched on is true. If you spin the table too
much."	
Message	Maria	Ah...	
Message	Maria	This is...	
Message	Maria	I see. The cup spins as well.	
Message	Shido	"It doesn't look like much at first, but it's a
blast, right?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. A very simple, but well-designed, mechanism.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's what you're impressed by...	
Message	Maria	Hee hee. It is fine. Fun as well.	
Message	Shido	I see. Happy to hear it.	
Message	Kotori	Hey hey, Onii-chan.	
Message	Kotori	I'm getting dizzier...	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. You like it slower.	
Message	Origami	"Welcome back. Pleased to see you enjoyed
yourselves."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Thanks for holding down the fort. Now,
next is... Hey, why don't you choose, Origami?"	
Message	Origami	"I see. When it comes to amusement parks...
you can't forget that."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Processing. I know what you mean, Lady
Origami. We are done with our warm-up,
yes?"	
Message	Shido	"Wait a minute. I'm not following. Where
are we going?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ohh. You don't get it, Shido-kun? It's\nthat, of course! The roller coaster!"	
Message	Yoshino	"The roller coaster is... apparently...
really popular."	
Message	Shido	I see.	
Message	Maria	I am interested as well.	
Message	Shido	"All right. It's decided. Time for the roller
coaster."
