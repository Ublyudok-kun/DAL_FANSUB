Message	Shido	"Phew, another day I've arrived home safe. Peaceful
days are the best."	
Message	None	"(I feel like my day suddenly started with my return
home. I have no idea what I did all day today... But I
guess it was just that peaceful.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm home! Oh... No one's home?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. You're late, my dear brother Shido. Where were
you killing time?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Long awaited. We were waiting for you, Shido. Dinner
is also ready."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Kaguya and Yuzuru? Why are you guys here...?
Did you just call me brother?"	
Message	Kaguya	Hm. What's the matter, Shido? You seem spacey today.	
Message	Yuzuru	"I agree. Could you be tired, Shido? If there is
something to worry about, please tell your older
sister, Yuzuru."	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Kaguya is my little sister and Yuzuru is my
older sister...? Oh, that's right. You two are my
family."	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. That is it exactly. What about it?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, nothing. I just felt like something was off for
some reason."	
Message	Kaguya	"Gosh, Shido. What is up with you? How long do you
want to make me wait in this neverending abyss?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? What about a neverending abyss?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Clarification. Kaguya is simply hungry. Her stomach
was growling as she waited for you."	
Message	Kaguya	"N-Nuh-uh! It's a neverending abyss! The boiling chaos
was losing its heat, and I couldn't just let it die."	
Message	Shido	"The boiling chaos...? Judging by the smell... Ah, I see.
You made hot pot tonight. And that's why you were
waiting for me to come home, huh?"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry for taking so long, Kaguya, Yuzuru-onesan.
I'm home."	
Message	Kaguya	"H-Hmph. I am going to offer you this steaming
hot sacrifice. You best be thankful."	
Message	Yuzuru	Returning the respect. Welcome home, Shido.	
Message	None	"(I sensed that something was different, but I guess
we're a family... Nothing's wrong with that, right?)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, I'm going to go to my room and change. I'll
be right back, so wait for me in the living room,
okay?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Understood. We'll be waiting.	
Message	Yuzuru	"...Suggestion. Shido, let me take your bag. I'm sure
it'll be in your way as you remove your shoes."	
Message	Kaguya	"Ah! No fair, Yuzuru! And you're going to follow him to
his room, aren't you?! I'll hold Shido's bag!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. Kaguya, I have no idea what you're talking
about. This is my job as Shido's older sister. Kaguya,
why don't you go skim off the scum from the hot pot?"	
Message	Kaguya	Grrr! That is mine! It's my job!	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha... I'm fine alone, so you guys wait for me in
the living room, yeah?"	
Message	Kaguya	Grr, if you say so.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. Very well. Then I'll return to the living
room."	
Message	Shido	"...Phew. Jeez, I just barely escaped that one. I know
they're my family and all, but it's a real challenge
sometimes."	
Message	None	"(I guess this is what you call a brother complex?
They're both like this, so sometimes it gets tiring,
but they're usually so cute and kind.)"	
Message	Shido	"Not so much lately as they've been more aggressive,
but I guess all is well."	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido! I am tired of waiting! Come forth like the swift
gales of the mighty sea!"	
Message	Shido	...Oh, crap. I'll be right over!	
Message	None	"(I thought I had calmed things down from earlier, but
I guess I was wrong.)"	
Message	Shido	"Mm... It's almost morning. I somehow feel so much
pressure already."	
Message	Kaguya	Zzz...zzz....	
Message	Yuzuru	Kuuuu...kuuuu.	
Message	Shido	"...Something's off. I hear something. My instinct is
telling me to ignore it, but I feel something heavy..."	
Message	Shido	"No point in staying in denial. I'm going to check! I'm
going to face reality!"	
Message	Shido	"...How do I put this? My fear was real. I kind of wished
I was wrong."	
Message	Shido	...What am I supposed to do?	
Message	Kaguya	Mmm, Shido...	
Message	Yuzuru	Breathe... zzzz...	
Message	None	"(...Let me officially introduce my family. These two
sleeping here are my little sister Kaguya and my
older sister Yuzuru.)"	
Message	Shido	"They're both totally in love with me, and whenever I
let my guard down, I wake up like this. Jeez, they're
so much trouble... Hahaha."	
Message	None	"(...Now isn't the time to be explaining it! I was so
taken aback that I threw in all this exposition.)"	
Message	Shido	"Damn it. You guys. I saw you two go into your room
last night. No wonder you were weirdly compliant..."	
Message	Shido	"You guys aren't at the ages where this should still
be happening. Come on. Can you not come into my
bed while I'm sleeping?"	
Message	Shido	"No matter how many times I tell you, you never listen.
Damn it. What am I, your body pillow?!"	
Message	None	"(And we're of age. I don't want something bad to
happen. But they totally ignore me. Am I the one in
the wrong here?)"	
Message	Shido	"No, that can't be. If they wake up, it's not going to
end well. I wonder if I can get out before they do..."	
Message	Kaguya	Shido... You come to me... Zzz.	
Message	Yuzuru	Correction... Come closer to Yuzuru... Kuu.	
Message	Shido	"No...! I'm being pinned from both sides by something
super soft."	
Message	None	"(No... Every time they move, it just gets worse. And
they're totally holding my arms down. I need to get
out, or I'm not gonna last.)"	
Message	Shido	"If I move, they'll wake up. I have to get out in a way
that won't wake them."	
Message	None	"(Okay... Should I start with my right arm or my left
arm? If one side's free, I'm sure it'll be easier for
me to take out the other side.)"	
Message	None	"(Patience is key. If I rush things, it'll lead to disaster.
Stay calm. Think.)"	
Message	None	(Do I start with Kaguya or Yuzuru? The answer is...)	
Choice		Kaguya, you're it!	
Choice		Yuzuru, I choose you!	
Message	Shido	"If I'm level-headed about it, my analysis should yield
the best answer. I'll get Kaguya off me first...!"	
Message	Shido	"I guess on Kaguya's side, I feel less pressure on my
arm. I mean... she has a smaller chest."	
Message	Kaguya	Huh?! ...*sniffle*.	
Message	None	(Huh? Did she hear me? No, that can't be...)	
Message	Kaguya	*Whimper*... Shido. So messed up... Zzzzz.	
Message	Shido	"Ah, she's sleeping. But for some reason, she looks
sad. I feel guilty now..."	
Message	None	"(N-No. This isn't the time to feel guilty! I need to
get out of this situation. Remember, I'm a prisoner
stuck between my two sisters.)"	
Message	None	"(I can't let emotion drive my decisions. If I do,
Ragnarok awaits.)"	
Message	Shido	"...No, this isn't good, I'm off my game now. Kaguya's
thing's a little distracting. I've graduated from this."	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya sometimes looks at me with sparkly eyes
and says, "Brother, let's talk about the good old
times and the dark days," but I can't go back."	
Message	None	"(...Stop. Although I have sympathy toward my family,
I need to be level-headed. I must suppress my emotions
and get Kaguya off me first!)"	
Message	None	"(So I guess I can move my arm... Take it slow. Really
slow.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Mmm...	
Message	None	"(*Grunt*... She's clinging on so desperately. Like
she's actually denying my escape.)"	
Message	Shido	"Calm down. I still have a chance. If I move slowly, I
should be able to get free."	
Message	None	(Take it slow. Really slow.)	
Message	Kaguya	F-Fweee...	
Message	None	(C-Crap! My arm is grazing Kaguya's nose...!)	
Message	Kaguya	...A-CHOO!	
Message	None	(It's over... It's all over.)	
Message	Shido	"Yuzuru-onesan seems to be a bit more reserved, and
her grip is weaker."	
Message	None	(I have to take advantage of that.)	
Message	Shido	"Yuzuru-onesan, I'm going to move you a bit. She
seems to be in a deep sleep, so I should be fine,
right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Mmmmm.	
Message	Shido	Ouhh!	
Message	None	"(The moment I tried to slip out, she pushed her chest
further into me?!)"	
Message	Shido	"...C-Crap. I couldn't help but make a weird noise. I
feel like I touched something super soft... but it was
an accident."	
Message	Yuzuru	Request... Shido, more...	
Message	None	(...?! What is she saying?!)	
Message	Shido	"...She's sleeping, right? Yeah she is. I want to
believe that she is."	
Message	None	"(But still, my situation isn't good. I-I guess I'll try one
more time. I'll be careful, like threading a needle...)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Mmmm...mmm.	
Message	Shido	Aieee!	
Message	None	"(N-No. Every time I get closer to freedom, her
chest... Yuzuru-onesan, this is a perfect trap you've
set. You're scary!)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Hehe... Are you done checking?	
Message	Shido	Huh, wait... Yuzuru-onesan, are you awake?	
Message	Kaguya	What's going on, you guys?	
Message	Yuzuru	Awoken. Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Kaguya	Ah, the bright light. What a refreshing awakening.	
Message	None	"(This is the worst. I couldn't even escape before they
woke up. I have no choice but to run for it when I
have the chance.)"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, you two. Morning. Why are you guys in my
bed?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... You were so cold last night. So we decided
to balance you out."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. We snuck in last night. Shido, you are in our
joint custody."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see. Is that so? You guys are such trouble.
Anyways... I'm going to go make breakfast..."	
Message	Shido	AH!	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... I won't let you get away... I'm not satisfied
yet!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Warning. I suggest you give up and stay still until
Yuzuru is satisfied. That is an older sister's
orders."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. Shido. Yahh. Ahhh, I'm not going to move for
another 30 minutes."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Hehe. I guess I'll let you have the other
side, Kaguya."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... I can't run. Someone! Help me!	
Message	None	(Another day when my sisters toy with me... *sigh*...)
