Message	None	"(I waited in front of the school gates, and heard the
bell finally ring. After a little while, she arrived.)"	
Message	Shido	Heeey, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Shido?	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter? Aren't you supposed to be in
school?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, it ended early so I came to pick you up. What's up
with that reaction? You sound like a mom who's just
seen her son up to no good."	
Message	Kotori	"You know, it's common nowadays to call the cops on a
person waiting for a girl at the gates of a school."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, the world has become a terrible place.	
Message	Kotori	"We seem to have the same thoughts for the first time
in a while."	
Message	Kotori	So, did you just come to pick me up?	
Message	Shido	Yeah?	
Message	Kotori	All the way here?	
Message	Shido	"I mean, it's not that far away. I didn't have anything
better to do."	
Message	Shido	"You always come pick me up. I figured I could return
the favor once in a while."	
Message	None	"(Kotori's usually the one who waits for me to get out.
If I could use her words, she comes all the way to my
school.)"	
Message	None	"(As I was thinking about how much I appreciated it,
Kotori gave me a mean smirk.)"	
Message	Kotori	"What? Shido, you wanted to see me that badly? You
could've waited for me at home and I would've
eventually been there."	
Message	Shido	Well, that's not the... Well, I guess you're right.	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh. You're so wishy-washy. That's gonna be a real
turn-off for people."	
Message	None	"(The way she says it sounds like Kotori picks me up
because she wants to see me right away. But is that
okay?)"	
Message	Kotori	Just kidding. Thanks for picking me up.	
Message	None	"(And here she is, suddenly smiling and being adorable.
She was just toying with me. I fell silent.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, did that make you mad? Sorry about that. I'm
really happy you came."	
Message	None	"(Kotori rushed to explain herself. When she put it
that way, how could I complain?)"	
Message	None	"(Gosh, she turns so modest out of the blue. That's so
unfair.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, how did you expect me to react? I'm allowed to
tease you, you know?"	
Message	Kotori	Do you mean, as my brother? Or...	
Message	Kotori	As... a boyfriend?	
Message	None	"(She whispered in my ear, and my heart skipped a
beat.)"	
Message	Shido	The latter.	
Message	None	"(There was a pause, but this time I was able to say it
clearly... But it got me embarrassed.)"	
Message	Kotori	I see. Hehe.	
Message	None	"(Kotori gave a small smile. She should have just been
honest and said that she was happy to see me.)"	
Message	None	(But I guess her not doing so makes her cute.)	
Message	Classmate A	Oh, Kotori-chan. Bye-byeeee!	
Message	Classmate B	See you tomorrow!	
Message	Kotori	Bye, guys.	
Message	Shido	Your friends?	
Message	Kotori	Yes. They're nice to me.	
Message	Shido	That's cool. I should thank them someday.	
Message	Kotori	"Why are you acting like my guardian? Suddenly such an
important man..."	
Message	Kotori	Anyways, let's go home.	
Message	None	(Kotori offered her hand and I naturally took it.)	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido? I have homework, so help tutor me later.	
Message	Shido	There's nothing for me to tutor you in.	
Message	Kotori	"""Gosh, where's your fighting spirit? Can't you say,
Leave it to me. I can even factorize the formula of
love for you,"" or something?"	
Message	Shido	"""Leave it to me. I can even factorize the formula of\nlove for you."" That doesn't even make sense..."	
Message	Kotori	You don't have to say that. That's not romantic.	
Message	Shido	Is that so?	
Message	None	(We were chatting as usual as we headed home.)	
Message	Kotori	Hmm. Should I choose pink? Or light blue?	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido? Shido, which do you think is better?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Either or―	
Message	Kotori	"―is fine, right? If you say that... You know what I'm
going to do to you, don't you?"	
Message	None	"(Kotori smiled as she held the pink and blue
scrunchies.)"	
Message	None	"(That's right. I'm not allowed to say ""either or
during a date. Those were the basics that Kotori
instilled in me.)"""	
Message	None	(I coughed and then made my choice.)	
Message	Shido	"Why don't you go with pink? That's a pretty normal
color."	
Message	Kotori	Pink... Pink, huh? Hehehe.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori. You don't have many things in that color. I
think it's fine from time to time."	
Message	Kotori	You're right. If you say so, Shido.	
Message	None	(Kotori put on the pink scrunchie and posed.)	
Message	Kotori	Hehe. What do you think? Do I look good?	
Message	Shido	Oh, I think it's fine.	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh, that's not good enough, Shido. You have to tell
me if I look good in it."	
Message	Shido	It looks good. And...	
Message	Kotori	And...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	It looks good... and what, Shido?	
Message	Shido	...You look cute.	
Message	Kotori	Heheh.	
Message	None	"(Kotori seems happy that she was able to get the
word she was looking for. I scratched my cheek,
embarrassed.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori wouldn't let me go unless I said that much.
But whatever, she looks happy, so that's all that
matters.)"	
Message	Classmate A	Oh, Kotori-chan?	
Message	Classmate B	Oh, you're right. Heeey.	
Message	Kotori	Oh.	
Message	None	"(We looked for the voice and saw two girls around her
age.)"	
Message	Classmate A	Huh? Weren't you at the school gate?	
Message	Classmate B	"Oh yeah, I remember. The brother that came to pick up
Kotori-chan!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's you guys.	
Message	None	"(They were the friends that passed by when I went
to go pick up Kotori. If they go to the same school as
Kotori, they must live in Tengu City, too.)"	
Message	None	(It makes sense that they'd be shopping around here.)	
Message	Classmate A	"Hey, wait. Shopping, just the two of you? Isn't that
like a date?"	
Message	Classmate B	Wait, what? Is that it, Kotori-chan? Is this a date?	
Message	Kotori	Wha―?! U-Um, er...	
Message	None	"(Kotori turned bright red when they asked her
directly.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Y-Yeah. His name is Shido and he's my br... I mean,
um..."	
Message	Kotori	M-My boyfriend...	
Message	Classmate A	What? What did you say?	
Message	Kotori	B-Boyfriend! BOYFRIEND!	
Message	Classmate A・B	AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!	
Message	None	"(The girls squealed and my eardrums felt like they
were going to explode. Kotori's friends held each
other's hands and screamed.)"	
Message	Classmate A	Did you hear that?! Boyfriend!	
Message	Classmate B	Wow, a real one?! I never knew they existed.	
Message	Classmate A	M-May I touch you?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Sure, I guess.	
Message	None	"(I impulsively responded and their hands reached out,
touching all over my body.)"	
Message	Classmate A・B	WOOOOOOOW!	
Message	Classmate A	A real one! A real one!	
Message	Classmate B	I felt his body! It wasn't all in my head!	
Message	Kotori	What do you mean?!	
Message	None	"(Kotori yelled in protest, but the two continued to
touch my body. And each time they'd squeal.)"	
Message	None	"(G-Gosh, they're loud. These girls are so hyper
that I can't keep up.)"	
Message	None	(I looked over and saw Kotori was pouting.)	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Nothing. Aren't you glad to have cute girls all over
you?"	
Message	Shido	I feel like a monster or some kind of alien.	
Message	Kotori	Hmph.	
Message	None	"(Man, she's in a bad mood. I need to end it there or
she'll get completely angry.)"	
Message	Shido	Uh, guys?	
Message	Classmate A	Hmm, but don't you think its weird?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	None	"(I tried to stop them and their conversation took a
turn.)"	
Message	Classmate B	"Yeah. I mean you guys look good together, but
something is off."	
Message	Classmate A	Honestly, you guys don't seem like you're dating.	
Message	Classmate B	Yeah. It feels like you guys are close siblings?	
Message	Kotori	What...! Th-That's not true!	
Message	None	(Kotori responded strongly.)	
Message	Kotori	We're not siblings! It's true!	
Message	Kotori	Shido and I are g-going out for real! We're dating!	
Message	Kotori	Shido, say something!	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay. Don't yank me.	
Message	None	(I cleared my throat. Their gazes were piercing.)	
Message	Shido	I-It's true. We're dating. Right, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Y-Yes, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Why are you getting all uncomfortable?!	
Message	Kotori	"I-I can't help it! It's hard to talk about this in
front of my friends! Gosh Shido, can't you be more
bold?"	
Message	Shido	It's hard for me, too!	
Message	None	"(Knowing they were Kotori's friends, I suddenly became
nervous. Their gazes turned more doubtful.)"	
Message	None	(Th-This doesn't look good.)	
Message	Classmate A	Then show us proof.	
Message	Shido	Proof?	
Message	Classmate A	"Yeah, proof that you two are dating. Like... for
example, you guys could kiss?"	
Message	Kotori	K-Kiss?!	
Message	Classmate B	Oh, that's nice!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait a minute!	
Message	None	(Things are taking a weird turn!)	
Message	Classmate A	I mean, you can kiss her on the cheek or something.	
Message	Classmate B	Or can you not do it?	
Message	Classmate A	Then you guys aren't...	
Message	Kotori	I-I can totally do that! It's nothing!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori!	
Message	None	(Kotori responded before I could stop her.)	
Message	Kotori	"Sh-Sh-Sh-Shido, you stay out of this! I can't back
down now! Leave it all to me!"	
Message	Shido	Your eyes look unfocused!	
Message	None	"(She's totally thrown off! Honestly, I don't think she
can calm down at this rate.)"	
Message	Kotori	I-It's fine. It's just a peck on the cheek...	
Message	None	(Kotori trailed off.)	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's wrong?	
Message	Kotori	P-People will see...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	(Kotori looked around with her brows furrowed.)	
Message	None	"(It was the shopping district in broad daylight. There
were enough people walking about to begin with, but
since we made a ruckus, some were looking at us.)"	
Message	None	"(And of course, Kotori's two friends were glued to
our every move.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, you're shaking, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"W-Well... When you think about it, I'm out here in
broad daylight..."	
Message	Kotori	A-And there are a lot of people...	
Message	Kotori	"No... People are going to see me do something
embarrassing..."	
Message	None	"(Gosh... Look how bright red she is. She's about to
cry, yet she's acting so tough. She is a handful.)"	
Choice		Be kind and give her advice	
Choice		Fire her up	
Message	None	"(It's no use. I have to do something about this
situation.)"	
Message	Shido	Calm down, Kotori. I'll take the lead.	
Message	Kotori	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, leave it to me. You ready? Do as I say.	
Message	Kotori	O-Okay, I will.	
Message	None	(Good, she nodded.)	
Message	Shido	"Well, first put your hand on my face, and hold it so I
won't move."	
Message	Kotori	L-Like this?	
Message	Shido	Gah?!	
Message	Kotori	"F-F-F-First, I need to hold his face so he won't
move...!"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, um, Kotori-san? You don't have to put that
much power into it!"	
Message	Kotori	What's next? What do I do next? Hurry up, Shido.	
Message	Shido	She's not even listening!	
Message	None	"(I thought I could hear my head making a cracking
noise. Oh no, oh no! H-How powerful could she be?!)"	
Message	Shido	N-Now, stand straight! Try to reach my height.	
Message	Kotori	O-Okay.	
Message	Shido	And then put your face to mine.	
Message	None	"(Kotori was breathing heavily, and it tickled my
cheeks.)"	
Message	None	(Slowly, slowly, her blushing face neared and―)	
Message	Kotori	...Muah.	
Message	Classmate A・B	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!	
Message	None	"(As I felt something soft, there was major squealing
around me.)"	
Message	Kotori	...I did it. Despite everyone watching.	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Message	None	"(Kotori sounded different as she spoke, and I felt my
heart skip. But it only lasted for a second. Kotori
snapped out of it and jumped away from me.)"	
Message	Kotori	S-So, how's that? You convinced now?!	
Message	Classmate A	Yeah, totally!	
Message	Classmate B	I totally saw it!	
Message	None	"(The two girls seemed excited, grabbing Kotori's hand
giddily. As they made a ruckus, I brought my hand to
my cheek.)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	(It felt like Kotori's soft lips were still lingering.)	
Message	None	(...Man, I guess I had to take one for the team.)	
Message	Kotori	D-Don't move, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Hey, don't push yourself.	
Message	None	(I pushed Kotori back and slumped my shoulders.)	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, you won't be able to kiss me. You're still a
baby."	
Message	Kotori	...What?	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Did you not hear me? You're still a baby, so you
don't have the guts to kiss me, right?"	
Message	Shido	"This is something we can do after you mature. You're
still a wimp, so you can't do it."	
Message	Kotori	WH-WH-WH-WHAT... DID YOU SAYYYY?!	
Message	None	"(Kotori shouted as loudly as the girls did, glaring at
me.)"	
Message	Kotori	You sure have a big mouth, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Well. I mean, you're a child. I bet you don't know how
to kiss."	
Message	Kotori	"Stop calling me a baby! I know how to do it! I'm
totally gonna!"	
Message	Shido	AH?! Ow, ow, ow, ow, K-Kotori! My neck!	
Message	Kotori	If I do this, you won't move, right?	
Message	Shido	It feels like I'll never move again!	
Message	Kotori	Bring it on!	
Message	None	"(N-No! She's serious! I've gone too far! And my neck
won't move at all! How powerful is she?!)"	
Message	Kotori	You can't run now. So what do I do next?	
Message	Shido	Is this a situation where you can ask that?!	
Message	Kotori	"I applaud you for getting me pumped. But you've
underestimated me."	
Message	Shido	"I wouldn't want my girlfriend to say such a thing to
me!"	
Message	None	Are you some kind of evil emperor?!	
Message	Kotori	Shido, brace yourself. *pant*... *pant*...	
Message	Shido	"Your breathing! You're breathing heavily! Your face...
It looks wrong!"	
Message	Kotori	Here I go!	
Message	Shido	AHHHH!	
Message	Kotori	...Mm...	
Message	None	(Kotori's kiss was a lot softer than I anticipated.)	
Message	None	"(But that was just a split second. The next moment,
Kotori glared at her friends.)"	
Message	Kotori	How was that? You happy now?	
Message	Classmate A・B	Y-Yesss...	
Message	None	(They were both totally turned off.)	
Message	Classmate A	U-Um, we just remembered we had to go somewhere!	
Message	Classmate B	Y-Yeah, totally! I have to go now! Like right now!	
Message	Classmate A・B	E-Excuse us!	
Message	None	(Intimidated by Kotori's aura, they ran off.)	
Message	Shido	Phew....	
Message	None	(I sighed in relief and she yanked on my sleeves.)	
Message	Kotori	"Shido. You sure said some interesting things earlier.
We need to talk later. You'd best not run."	
Message	Shido	Ha...hahaha...	
Message	None	"(I felt sweat trickling down my spine. It was nice to
taunt Kotori, but I wasn't thinking about what would
happen afterwards.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Ah, this feels good. I feel like Shido will cater to
me all day today."	
Message	None	(God... Please give Kotori a little compassion.)	
Message	Shido	All right. We're done shopping.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori? How long are you going to pout for?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	"(Kotori's friends acknowledged us as a couple. That
was great, but ever since they left, Kotori has been
pouting.)"	
Message	Shido	"What's your problem? You keep that up and it won't
be cute at all."	
Message	Shido	You were so cute when you kissed me.	
Message	Kotori	―!!	
Message	None	"(Suddenly, Kotori looked at me with a bright red
face.)"	
Message	Kotori	"IDIOT! IDIOT! SHIDO, YOU'RE AN IDIOT! I'm never going
to do something that embarrassing ever again!"	
Message	Shido	Ou! Owwww! Don't hit me! HEY!	
Message	None	"(Kotori punched me with her small fists. I guess she
was really embarrassed kissing in front of people.
Her face was bright red.)"	
Message	Kotori	"...I-If you want to do something like that, I'll do it
a lot when we get home..."	
Message	Shido	Oh... I see...	
Message	Kotori	Yeah...	
Message	None	(Now it was my turn to blush.)	
Message	Kotori	L-Let's hurry home.	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Message	None	"(She grabbed my sleeves and we began to walk awkwardly
back.)"	
Message	None	"(I thought this side of Kotori was cute, but God knows
what she'll say if I say that, so I'm going to keep this to
myself.)"
