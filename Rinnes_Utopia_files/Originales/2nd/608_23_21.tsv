Message	None	"(That afternoon, in between classes—no, even
during classes—I explained the situation to
each girl, hoping to improve their moods.)"	
Message	None	"(But it took my entire day, right up to when
school ended.)"	
Message	Shido	Maria, are you there?	
Message	Maria	Yes, I am.	
Message	Shido	Thank goodness. You came after all.	
Message	Maria	"However, why did you ask me to meet you
behind the school?"	
Message	Shido	"Um, it could be chaotic if we're seen together
again."	
Message	Maria	"While that may be true, could we not have
met somewhere outside in the first place?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but you don't have a cellphone or
anything, right Maria? If something were
to happen, it might be hard to reach you."	
Message	Maria	I see. That is true.	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's how it is, so let's head out the
back gate."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. This means you will go on a date with
me as well today, yes?"	
Message	Shido	Yup, that's right. Let's have a date.	
Message	None	"(I'm worried about the other Spirits, and for
now I'll prioritize Maria. I do want clues on
how to escape this world, too.)"	
Message	None	"(Moreover, I want to show Maria even more
things.)"	
Message	Shido	"So today, I thought we could head near the
train station and look at all of the shops.
What do you say?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. I look forward to it.	
Message	Shido	I see. Then, let's go.	
Message	Maria	They have such a vast selection of items.	
Message	Shido	"Right? See anything that catches your
eye?"	
Message	Maria	Everything looks so enticing. What is this one?	
Message	Shido	"I think that's a coaster? You rest your cups
on top of them."	
Message	Maria	"My records indicate that they are normally
composed of paper or cloth, but it appears
some are made with metal as well."	
Message	Shido	Sure, but those aren't too common.	
Message	Maria	Shido, would this coaster be made of paper?	
Message	Shido	"Lemme see... This is a menko. Kind of a strange
thing to be selling still. Who still uses menkos?"	
Message	Maria	"Menko, you said? From what I see, it is a toy.
Although it seems one could use it as a coaster
too. Can you not rest your cup upon it?"	
Message	Shido	"Technically you could, but... that's not what
it was made for."	
Message	Maria	"How peculiar. While their intended purposes
are different, are they not used similarly for
functional reasons?"	
Message	Shido	"No, I don't think so. It's like you said, Maria,
it's the thickness of the menko's paper that
makes it similar to a coaster."	
Message	Maria	"With their similarities, one could be used as
a substitute for the other. A simple concept,
but quite amazing."	
Message	Shido	"It is. Japanese people seem to value that
quality too. In fact Maria, if there's something
you wanna get, just tell me. I'll buy it for you."	
Message	Maria	For now, I will refrain.	
Message	Shido	You don't have to hold back, ya know?	
Message	Maria	"No. I have never been shopping before, so
when asked to buy something suddenly, I
am at a loss for what to buy."	
Message	Shido	"I guess that's true. Then, if you find anything,
tell me, okay?"	
Message	Maria	Okay.	
Message	Shido	"Cool. Next time we come here, let's invite the
others to come with us."	
Message	Maria	The others? Why should we?	
Message	Shido	"It's fun to browse when everyone's pointing
things out, you know? Besides, I gotta make it
up to them somehow. Since it's my fault."	
Message	Maria	...Yes. I would like to experience that.	
Message	Shido	Right. Then, let's do that. It's a promise.	
Message	Maria	Yes, it is a promise.	
Message	Clerk	Welcome!	
Message	Maria	"This is a clothing shop, yes? Do you plan on
buying clothes here?"	
Message	Shido	"No, I didn't have anything in mind. I just
figured girls liked looking around in stores
like this."	
Message	Maria	It is very interesting.	
Message	Shido	I see. That's good then.	
Message	None	"(As I thought, Maria spent time looking through
every nook and cranny of the shop. I'll leave
her be.)"	
Message	Clerk	"Are you siblings? Your younger sister there is
adorable."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Er, ha ha ha...	
Message	Clerk	If you'd like, I can search for something.	
Message	Shido	"Um. Sorry, we're just looking around to get
an idea."	
Message	Clerk	"I see. If you find something you like, please
call me."	
Message	Maria	What were you speaking about?	
Message	Shido	"Apparently, that person thought we were
siblings."	
Message	Maria	Siblings?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Guess so. Even though we look nothing
alike. Well, that store clerk is an NPC, so it
might be an automated response or something."	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Maria	No. It is nothing. Let us go, Shido.	
Message	None	"(Maybe it's my imagination, but ever since
we left the store, Maria's been quiet... It's
a little awkward.)"	
Message	Shido	Maria, where to next... Hm?	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, Maria stopped and looked
upwards. Her eye was caught on a giant poster
for a movie that was playing.)"	
Message	None	"(On the poster, there were a man and a woman
smiling, locked in embrace. Is it a romance?
...This is perfect.)"	
Message	Shido	Maria. Let's go to that movie theater.	
Message	Maria	Movie... Right now?	
Message	None	"(In a theater, awkward silences can be smoothed
over. When it's over, I bet her mood will be
better.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Seems like a short movie. Shouldn't take
more than an hour. It won't be that late."	
Message	Maria	I understand.	
Message	Shido	...I was tricked.	
Message	None	"(There were some romantic scenes, but it was
a horror movie. What the hell was up with that
poster...?)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Maria. You okay...?	
Message	Maria	Yes, but that was rather intense...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It took me for a ride too. All right,
then. Let's go."	
Message	Maria	Yes. Um, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	What's wrong?	
Message	Maria	Would it be okay to lock arms while we walk?	
Choice		Walk with locked arms.	
Choice		Walk with hands held.	
Message	Shido	All right, here. Grab on.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Thank you.	
Message	None	"(Maria timidly wraps her arm around mine,
and we begin to walk.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I didn't expect it to be that kind of
movie. Did you have a bad time?"	
Message	Maria	No, that is not the case.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Then, why...?	
Message	Maria	"Even like this, do you think we look like
siblings?"	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	(What? Could it be...?)	
Message	Shido	"Maria, was your reason for looking at the
movie poster not because you wanted to
see the film, but instead..."	
Message	Maria	"Because the man and woman were linking
arms."	
Message	None	"(It's true, they had a romantic side plot in
the story.)"	
Message	None	"(Which means the reason Maria wanted
to link arms wasn't because she was scared.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, how do you see us right now?	
Message	Shido	W-Well, hahaha... I wonder.	
Message	None	"(Siblings who walk with linked arms...
aren't exactly uncommon, I suppose.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Maria. Then, why don't we hold hands?	
Message	Maria	Hold... hands?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Do you not want to, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"I am not opposed to it. In fact, I am glad.
But, this is..."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Maria	"Would it not appear like a younger sister being
pulled around by her older brother?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Um, I don't think so?	
Message	Shido	"Maria, is what that person said at the store
still bothering you?"	
Message	Maria	"That is not the case, but if we are on a date,
then I wish to look like a couple."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Well, I don't think it matters what other
people think, you know? We are who we are.
Their opinion doesn't change anything."	
Message	Maria	"Is that so? Couldn't one say that the first time
an outsider acknowledges your relationship is
when it becomes official?"	
Message	Shido	Hm. Is it... really like that? I don't think so.	
Message	Maria	Very well. You are surprisingly cold, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"C-Cold... I didn't mean it the way it might
have come out."	
Message	Maria	"No, you are cold. You are like ice. Surely
your mind and body are similarly frigid."	
Message	Shido	C'mon, now... Hm. Here, take my hand.	
Message	Maria	Ah...	
Message	Shido	Isn't it warm?	
Message	Maria	Yes, very warm.	
Message	None	(I took Maria's hand, and started walking.)	
Message	Shido	Where do you want to go next?	
Message	Maria	"Let me see. If we are going to have dinner,
there is a restaurant I have been wanting to
try."	
Message	Maria	"I have seen one near the station that offers
a full-course special, popular amongst couples."	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! That's a little... Sorry, but I don't have
that kind of cash in my wallet."	
Message	Maria	Hee hee.	
Message	Maria	That was just a joke, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Ah, Maria... You were kidding me?	
Message	Maria	"Hee hee. I apologize. For some reason, I
wanted to pull a fast one on you."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's okay, but I'm surprised to see
you attempt a joke, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Really?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It was unexpected.
...So, where do you really want to go?"	
Message	Maria	Let me see...	
Message	Maria	"Why not find a place where the two of us
can relax?"	
Message	Shido	Relax... That isn't some euphemism, right?	
Message	Maria	...? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	Err, sorry. Forget about it...	
Message	Maria	...?	
Message	Shido	"It's fine. Wait, let's try stopping by Takadai
Park before going home. We can relax there.
If we go now, we'll make it in time for sunset."	
Message	Maria	Yes. Then let us go.	
Message	Shido	Now then, let's go home, Maria.	
Message	Maria	Um, Shido. Today was fun.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I had fun, too. To be honest, I'm kinda
exhausted."	
Message	None	"(While taking a stretch, I gazed out at the
sunset. So much has happened over the course
of the day.)"	
Message	Shido	What a beautiful sunset.	
Message	Maria	"Yes, it is. The sky is gorgeous. I can feel
it inside me."	
Message	Shido	"The sky seems to go on forever. I'm trapped
in this world, aren't I? It doesn't feel that way
at all."	
Message	Maria	Do you wish to return to the real world, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I do. I can't stay like this forever, after
all."	
Message	Maria	This is true...	
Message	Shido	The real world, huh?	
Message	None	"(It's fine if things go back to normal,
but then... What would happen to Maria?)"	
Message	None	(Will she end up alone in this world?)	
Message	None	"(If that's the case, I wonder what I should do
to save Maria.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, we should go home.	
Message	Shido	Hm...? Ahh, you're right.	
Message	None	"(No. If everything within the game is fixed,
then we should be able to log in at any time.
If that works, then we can still visit Maria.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's go home. To our house.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Let us return.	
Message	None	"(Maria answered, and for a moment, I thought
I saw a hint of loneliness in her eyes.)"
