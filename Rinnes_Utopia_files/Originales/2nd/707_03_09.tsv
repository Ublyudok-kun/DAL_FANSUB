Message	Shido	"I heard there's a popular café around here.
Is this it...?"	
Message	Kannazuki	Oh, Shido-kun.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh. It's you, Kannazuki-san. What are
you doing here?"	
Message	Kannazuki	I'm merely checking uniforms.	
Message	Shido	Uniforms? What do you mean?	
Message	Kannazuki	"The uniforms at this café are quite top-class,
after all."	
Message	Shido	"G-Gotcha... I don't get the hype, but try
not to get yourself caught."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Now, now. Don't misunderstand me! It isn't
with a sleazy gaze that I observe these girls!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"I do, after all, hold much respect for the
wonderful women who balance work and
pleasure. As well as entertain their customers."	
Message	Shido	"Then, why are you looking at the uniforms?
That's about as sleazy as it gets..."	
Message	Kannazuki	"It's, of course, to simulate mentally a situation
wherein Commander Itsuka wears them!"	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"Now, do not misunderstand me here either.
I'm not saying I wish the commander to wear
that uniform and give a service."	
Message	Kannazuki	"In fact, it's quite the opposite! If she were
to shower me with abuse in that garb...!
If she were to trample my back and bottom...!"	
Message	Kannazuki	Rrrraaaaahh!!	
Message	Shido	"Um, manager? I think you should ban that
guy."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Wait, Shido-kun?! Shido-kun!! Ohh!
The gates of paradise are closing!"
