Message	Shido	Heeeey, Mana.	
Message	Mana	Ah, Nii-sama!!	
Message	None	"(Mana was waving her hand from a little ways
away. Her voice sure travels. Everyone's
looking over.)"	
Message	None	(Well, not that she minds. I guess it's fine.)	
Message	Shido	Did I keep you waiting?	
Message	Mana	Yes, but it's no big deal.	
Message	Shido	"Huh, really? I thought I arrived earlier
than when we agreed to meet."	
Message	Mana	"No, it was because I was so freaking stoked
that I came early. Every second and minute
I spent waiting felt like an eternity!"	
Message	Shido	Ah, sorry... Thanks.	
Message	Mana	"After all, I'm freaking hanging out with you,
Nii-sama!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, let's have fun!	
Message	Mana	Of course!	
Message	Shido	But is this place okay, Mana?	
Message	Mana	"Well all's said and done, I don't know a freaking
thing about this city. Everywhere feels new."	
Message	Mana	"Besides, anywhere I get to hang out with
Nii-sama is guaranteed to be a freaking blast!"	
Message	Shido	"Then, let's take a walk around. You've never
been here before, right Mana?"	
Message	Mana	"Yeah, it's my first time. I'm freaking excited
to see the sights."	
Message	Shido	"All right. Then I'll guide you through every
corner. Is that all right?"	
Message	Mana	Please take good care of me, Nii-sama!
