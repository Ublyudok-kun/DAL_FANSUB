Message	None	(I wonder where Arusu went...)	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, I did bump into her in a
weird place at night last time."	
Message	Shido	Hmmm, maybe I can look for her over there.	
Message	Shido	Oh?	
Message	Shido	Hey, Arusu!	
Message	Arusu	Oh, you've come. Good evening, Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	"""Don't ""good evening"" me. You disappeared all of a
sudden, so I got worried. What are you doing here
alone? It's dangerous."""	
Message	Arusu	"I see, I see... So this is the kind of person
you are."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What are you talking about?	
Message	Arusu	"Nothing. Don't mind me. I just thought you
had an interesting mindset. That's all."	
Message	None	"(She's different than usual. She was like this
last night, too.)"	
Message	Shido	"What were you doing here? Everyone's worried.
Let's go back."	
Message	Arusu	"What was I doing...? Hmm... I was watching you,
Shido Itsuka. I mean, that's what I'm here for."	
Message	Shido	"But I just got here. What are you doing alone in
the park?"	
Message	Arusu	"Hehe... You see, I know everything about this
world. You understand, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	Come to think of it... you're right.	
Message	Arusu	Hey. Do you know why I've been watching you?	
Message	Shido	"Because... you want to know what love is?
You said you can figure it out by observing me...
I personally don't get it."	
Message	Arusu	To know what love is, huh...? I see, I see.	
Message	Shido	"What? You were the one who told me that. That
you'd stick by me until you understood what it
was."	
Message	Arusu	"Ah, I did, didn't I? But Shido Itsuka, do you know
what that means?"	
Message	Shido	"You're acting strange... I know I've asked you
before, but... You're Arusu, right?"	
Message	Arusu	"Yeah, and I've answered. I told you I am, but that
I'm not... I guess."	
Message	Shido	"But yesterday you said you were Arusu. What...
do you mean?"	
Message	Arusu	I wonder...?	
Message	Shido	So is it your... other personality...?	
Message	Arusu	"I won't tell you. But I think you're starting to
realize the answer for yourself."	
Message	Shido	I don't know what to say to that...	
Message	Arusu	"I'm Arusu. That is the only thing that has been
determined. So I would not make a mistake of it.
Ever."	
Message	Shido	Hmm... I see. Then let's just go home. It's late.	
Message	Shido	Oh, and the dessert you made—	
Message	Arusu	"Ah... Sorry, Shido Itsuka. There's still something
I need to do."	
Message	Arusu	So... later.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Arusu?!	
Message	Shido	...She's gone. Where did she go?	
Message	Shido	Jeez, I have to go and find her all over again.	
Message	Shido	"There you are...! Hey, Arusu! Gosh... I was
looking all over for you!"	
Message	Arusu	Shido Itsuka? You were looking for me?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You just disappeared. What are you doing
here?"	
Message	Arusu	"...I was looking at the stars. Is that appropriate
as an answer?"	
Message	Shido	The stars?	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. I wanted to see whether they look different
from here compared to when I look at them from
your house."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it'd be the same. Stars are so far away that
moving a bit shouldn't change their appearance."	
Message	Shido	"If you're in another country or on the other side
of the world, it may be different."	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. The location of the stars was barely
different. But... other things were moving..."	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Arusu	...That was irrelevant. Don't worry about it.	
Message	Shido	Really? Well, I won't force you to answer me.	
Message	None	"(I stood next to Arusu and looked up at the stars.
They did look the same as yesterday.)"	
Message	Arusu	"...This is interesting. It feels different from
when I was looking at them on my own."	
Message	Shido	"Really? Then maybe the time was different. You
know how it was late last night?"	
Message	Arusu	Is that what it is? ...I don't really get it.	
Message	Shido	"You said earlier that you had something you needed
to do. Was this it?"	
Message	Arusu	What are you talking about?	
Message	None	"(I wonder if the other Arusu's memory doesn't
transfer over to this Arusu.)"	
Message	Shido	It seems like there are two of you.	
Message	Arusu	What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	Oh... nothing.	
Message	Arusu	...Data states that I am Arusu. However...	
Message	Shido	However?	
Message	Arusu	"Arusu... This may be considered my last name.
Then that means... I may have a name... or I could
have one. I... don't get it, though."	
Message	Shido	Do you not remember your name?	
Message	Arusu	"Correct. Rather... I don't know whether I had one
or not."	
Message	Shido	"Hmmm, you know everything about this world, yet
you don't know much about yourself... Hmm, your
name, huh?"	
Message	None	"(Maybe I can think of one like Tohka's. If it's
the date, I might feel bad and regret it later...)"	
Message	Shido	How about Maria? Sorry, I just thought of it.	
Message	Shido	"Your clothes kind of remind me of a nun's, so I
thought it'd be perfect... Do you not like it?"	
Message	Arusu	Maria... Is that... my name?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, if you don't like it, you can choose
another name! I-It just popped up in my head."	
Message	Arusu	No. I want it... Maria, Maria Arusu. My... name.	
Message	Shido	Yeah... I think it suits you.	
Message	Arusu	"...Maria Arusu. Please call me that from now on,
Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Uh... Is Maria okay?	
Message	Arusu	Yes, I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, Maria. Feel free to address everyone by
their first names. I think everyone... rather, I'd
be happy if you did."	
Message	Maria	Understood... Shido.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Then... why don't we head back now?	
Message	Maria	"...I wish to look at the stars a little longer. Do
you mind?"	
Message	Shido	Sure, that's fine. I'll stay with you, then.	
Message	None	"(I looked up at the night sky. Yeah, the stars are
beautiful.)"	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's right. You made bavarois for the
cook-off earlier, right?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Since there were so many dishes, I thought to
make something that would aid in digestion."	
Message	Shido	"It was delicious. I was full when I started eating
it, but it made me feel better. And it tasted...
kind."	
Message	Maria	Tasted... kind...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it was a dish I could imagine you making.
So, for the cook-off... I chose that.
Your dessert."	
Message	Maria	You... chose me?	
Message	Shido	It was the most delicious.	
Message	Maria	You... chose me? Shido Itsuka... chose me?	
Message	Shido	Hm? It's not a problem, is it?	
Message	Maria	No... I just never imagined I would be chosen.	
Message	Shido	I see. But it really was delicious. Thanks, Maria.	
Message	Maria	No problem... This feels different.	
Message	None	"(Maybe Arusu... I mean, Maria, is starting
to change.)"	
Message	Maria	...Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Maria	...The stars are beautiful.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, they are beautiful.	
Message	Maria	...Yes.	
Message	None	"(For a little while longer, we continued to watch
the stars.)"
