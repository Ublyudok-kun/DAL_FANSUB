Message	Shido	Hmm... Which one should I choose?	
Message	Shido	"That one? If I pick that one, then maybe
this would work too..."	
Message	Shido	No, maybe not... Hm, is this better?	
Message	Shido	Hmmm...	
Message	Yoshinon	Hey, Shido-kun. What's the matter? I see\nyou muttering to yourself... *gasp*! Has love\ngot you stressed out?	
Message	Shido	I mean, you could say th―	
Message	Yoshino	"...What?! Sh-Shido-san, um... I'll do my best!
I'll do anything, so...!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Yoshino?!	
Message	None	"(When did Yoshino and Yoshinon enter
my room? I-I didn't even notice...)"	
Message	Yoshinon	HEYYY! Shido-kun, what's the meaning of\nthis? Don't tell me you're ignoring Yoshino...\nWhoa. You're a lowlife.	
Message	Shido	Of course not! I still care about Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, d-did I do something to... upset you?	
Message	Yoshinon	Hahahahaha. Right. Ever since you became\nYoshino's boyfriend, you've become the talk\nof the town.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean... talk of the town?	
Message	Yoshinon	Oh. Well, of course, that instead of hanging\nwith the other girls, you're partial to―	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon?!	
Message	Shido	"Hey. I like spending time with Yoshino,
and that's why we're friends. I told you.
That's all it is."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... Th-That makes me... happy.	
Message	Yoshinon	Woohoo! You make me jealous! Way to\nshow me up!	
Message	None	"(I'm still figuring out how to deal with
Yoshinon being around all the time. I'm
sure Yoshinon means well, but...)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, when did you two come into
my room?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh. Kotori-san showed us the way...	
Message	Shido	Where'd Kotori go?	
Message	Yoshinon	She said she's got stuff to do at the Fraxinus,\nso she asked us to watch the house～	
Message	Shido	Ah, I see.	
Message	Yoshino	Um, do you not want us around...?	
Message	Shido	"Of course I do. I'm just surprised because
I wasn't expecting you."	
Message	Yoshinon	Now, now. What's a surprise between\nfriends? Guys do it all the time.	
Message	None	(So, they snuck in on purpose.)	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, what were you stressing about...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, about that...	
Message	None	"(I'm sure I could play it off, but Yoshino
would probably worry about it either way.)"	
Message	None	(I might as well tell her.)	
Message	Shido	You know how we plans to go on a date?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...	
Message	None	"(Yoshinon is smirking next to her, but I'm
choosing to ignore it.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, I'm not exactly sure where to take you.	
Message	None	(Yoshino and Yoshinon cocked their heads.)	
Message	Yoshino	Um, and does that... bother you?	
Message	Yoshinon	I don't think Yoshino cares, do ya Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	"I figured Yoshino would say that, but that
stresses me out even more."	
Message	None	"(I'm sure she doesn't mind where we go.
Yoshino's open-minded and isn't one to complain.
But that doesn't give me an answer.)"	
Message	Shido	"I wanted to be like, ""HERE'S A PLACE!
But I just couldn't decide."""	
Message	Yoshino	...I see.	
Message	Yoshinon	I seeee. Shido-kun, you seem to be putting in a\nlot of effort! Take a look at all those pamphlets.\nAre you that excited to hang out with Yoshino?	
Message	None	"(Sprawled across my desks were several
guidebooks and pamphlets.)"	
Message	None	"(Among them was a ""gal game"", but I swear
it's not mine.)"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Everyone lent these to me.	
Message	None	"(I borrowed them Ratatoskr, of course.
If I screw up my time with Yoshino, they'd
never let me hear the end of it.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hmm, let's see... Movies, boutiques, eateries.\nAll very typical. I kinda get the sense you're\ntrying too hard.	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, there's amusement parks... The zoo,
and aquarium, too..."	
Message	None	"(I think Reine-san or Kotori suggested those.
They sound legitimate.)"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Those sound pretty good.	
Message	None	"(I put the non-conventional options inside
of my desk drawer.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hehehe. Right. You hid all the good stuff\naway from Yoshino, huh?	
Message	Yoshino	Um... what places are... too good?	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. Places like that are too much for a student
like me."	
Message	None	(Planning a trip is worse than pulling teeth.)	
Message	None	"(But if Yoshinon is here to scrutinize, then
I need to be mindful of what I show to
Yoshino.)"	
Message	None	"(Hm...? I wonder. Yoshinon's vision is only
as good as Yoshino's. If she isn't watching me,
then am I safe?)"	
Message	None	(Man, I'm distracting myself right now.)	
Message	Shido	"Is there somewhere you wanted to go,
Yoshino? Anywhere. Doesn't have to be
on the pamphlets."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Where I want to go...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Mm. It's your first date, so be confident\nand lead the way. That's what a man would\ndo.	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon...!	
Message	Shido	"When you put it that way, I feel bad. I just
want us to have equal input. Otherwise,
what's the point, you know?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hehehe. Don't wanna make a bad first\nimpression, right? I totally get it. Yup, yup.	
Message	Shido	"Hey. It's not like our first time hanging out.
All I want is for both of us to have a great
time. Is that so much to ask?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Oh, r-right...	
Message	Shido	"So, got any suggestions, Yoshino? Don't
hold back."	
Message	Yoshinon	Hmm. All these options are overwhelming.\nShido-kun, can't you think of something?\nIt's not like you don't have ideas.	
Message	Shido	"We visited the pool the other day, so maybe
we could avoid it this time."	
Message	None	"(I'm trying my damndest to avoid Yoshinon's
subtle hints.)"	
Message	Shido	"Maybe the zoo or the aquarium would
work. It'd be nice to go some place where
we could walk at our own pace."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um...	
Message	Shido	"I had a feeling you might find it crowded
though, Yoshino. If there's a movie you
wanted to see, we could do that!"	
Message	Yoshinon	Well, Yoshino doesn't normally walk in\ncrowds by herself, so maybe this is a good\nopportunity to stretch our legs.	
Message	Shido	"Or maybe we can go shopping? If you
needed to update your wardrobe, I could
carry your bags for you."	
Message	Yoshino	Um, all of that sounds fun, but...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Yoshino	My only... wish is to be with you, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshinon	Woohoo ♪  You're so sweet. Shido-kun, how\nlucky are you, huh? What are you gonna do\nabout it?	
Message	Shido	I don't know. I mean, it is nice of her to say.	
Message	None	"(It's just that I can tell Yoshino wasn't
really into any of my suggestions.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Tsk, tsk, tsk. Shido-kun, you don't get it.\nI can't trust you with Yoshino like this.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Yoshinon	No need to apologize. Besides, it's true\nthat Yoshino has fun wherever you are.	
Message	Shido	"About that. If that's sincere, we could go
anywhere, but we should avoid places that
Yoshino wouldn't like... Hm?"	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Does that mean we don't have to force
ourselves to go out...?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Ah, Shido-kun. You get it. Exactly. That's it.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino is very shy. She only got used to
Kotori and Tohka recently, but she's not
too good with strangers.)"	
Message	None	"(And if we were to go somewhere unfamiliar
to her, she would be overwhelmed by all the
new people.)"	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um, I... I'm fine with your suggestions.
I bet I can have fun with you anywhere."	
Message	Shido	"The minute you say ""I'm fine"" leads me to
believe you are unsatisfied."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Oh, um, well...	
Message	Shido	"Maybe we should think of places where
other people won't bother us."	
Message	Yoshino	What?! Sh-Shido-san, does that mean―?	
Message	Yoshinon	Huh? Shido-kun, is that what you want?\nBeing alone with Yoshino when no one\nelse is around? Jeez, Shido-kun. Bold!	
Message	Yoshino	...Y-Yoshinon?!	
Message	Shido	Huh? OH! That's not what I meant!	
Message	Yoshinon	Aw, then what DO you mean? Come on!\nSpit it out!	
Message	Shido	"I mean, we can still hang out, but I don't
mind if we spend time at home."	
Message	Yoshinon	Hm. I see. Well, being alone inside of\na boy's room is nerve-wracking.	
Message	Shido	"My room's fine, but there's nothing to do
here."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, but you'll be here...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Yoshinon	AHEM! Well, whatever works. Why don't\nyou to strike up some cute conversation?	
Message	Yoshino	?!	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you saying? That's not what
we were getting at!"	
Message	Yoshinon	Oh, whaaaat? She's here. You embarrassed?	
Message	Shido	N...No!	
Message	Yoshino	...Am I wrong?	
Message	Shido	W-Well, it's not wrong, but...	
Message	Yoshinon	Oh, ho? Well, whatever.	
Message	None	"(There are so many weird implications here,
but if I worry about it, I'll look weird.)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, please lead the way, Shido-san.	
Message	None	"(With that, we decided to stay home instead
of planning a grand date.)"	
Message	None	(On the day of...)	
Message	Yoshinon	Hey, hey! Shido-kun! Yoshino has arrived!	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon?!	
Message	Shido	"Hey, welcome... I mean, you guys do live
next door."	
Message	Yoshinon	So close, yet so far. Can you picture how\nunbearable that is?	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino's been nervous since last night.\nAs soon as she got up, she hopped into the\nbath.	
Message	None	(Oh. That explains the fragrant scent.)	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, w-well, um...	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. Make yourselves at home. It's not
like we're doing anything crazy."	
Message	Yoshinon	So you say. Shido-kun. You're keeping\na secret, aren't you?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are you talking about?! Of course not!	
Message	Yoshinon	Hoo boy. Then Shido-kun, what's on the\nitinerary?	
Message	Shido	"Well, about that. I hope you like this,
Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	Um, is that a DVD?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I've got a bunch.	
Message	Yoshinon	None of them look rented. So, are these\nyour kinda flicks, Shido-kun?	
Message	Yoshino	...They are all for women.	
Message	Shido	Oh. My friend lent those to me.	
Message	Yoshinon	Oh, really? Any recommendations?	
Message	Shido	Well, I haven't watched all of them...	
Message	Yoshinon	Man, then you haven't done your research.	
Message	Shido	Sorry...	
Message	None	"(Realizing right now that I slipped and had
told Kotori about what we're doing today.)"	
Message	None	"(Even though we're just at home, because
I didn't make concrete ""plans"", Kotori called
me in for an emergency meeting.)"	
Message	None	"(Then, she lent me stacks of movies to kill
time. I kinda picked whatever looked good.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Heeeey, Shido-kuuun? You're staring.\nWhat's the matter?	
Message	Yoshino	Um. Are you tired...?	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. Nothing. I'm fine.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, okay...	
Message	Shido	"Kotori's out today, so don't worry about
her. Just make yourselves at home."	
Message	Yoshino	If that is the case, I will...	
Message	Shido	"If you're not interested in any of these DVDs,
we don't have to watch them."	
Message	Yoshinon	Yeah, but I think one or two of 'em caught\nYoshino's eye.	
Message	Shido	Oh, really?	
Message	Yoshinon	Yup. She's especially interested in the\nromance ones. In that sense, you've got\na good eye, Shido-kun!	
Message	Shido	Haha. Well, I'm glad.	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, I'm interested in them... not just because
they have good stories..."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Then why is that?	
Message	Yoshino	"Um... I-I'm not experienced with dating... So I
thought... it'd be a good way to study."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	"I don't really know... what to do...  I want to
learn... so I don't embarrass myself."	
Message	Shido	Don't worry about that. Just be your―	
Message	None	"(As I said that, Yoshinon made eye contact
with me.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Just be what? Come on, out with it! What\nwere you going to say?	
Message	Shido	"Well, if you find a movie you like, then
let's pop it in."	
Message	Yoshinon	Jeez, Shido-kun! Such a tease!	
Message	Yoshino	Then, how about this one...?	
Message	None	"(Yoshino grabbed a foreign drama that was
released quite a few years ago...)"	
Message	Shido	Sure. Why'd you pick that one?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, I've heard of it, but I never watched it...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino doesn't go into rental shops by\nherself.	
Message	None	"(She should just ask Kotori to grab it for
her, but I guess for Yoshino it's a matter
of principle.)"	
Message	Shido	"Then, from now on, we can visit the store
together."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, okay...!	
Message	None	"(I flashed a kind smile at Yoshino, to which
she returned a warm grin. Yoshinon, on the
other hand, gave me a funny look.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, um, I have tea and snacks.	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun, you could be bolder. I mean,\nit's just you two here.	
Message	None	"(I ignored Yoshinon's taunts. I opened the
DVD case, sat next to Yoshino on the sofa,
and pressed play.)"	
Message	None	"(I, too, had heard of the foreign film we
were watching, but I never went to see
it.)"	
Message	None	"(Not in a rude way, but I found it unexpectedly
entertaining.)"	
Message	Shido	...I thought it'd be cheesier, but it wasn't.	
Message	None	(We finished the film, and I swapped the disc.)	
Message	Yoshinon	Yeah, totally. I was expecting a total rom-com,\nbut it ended up being more of a coming-of-age.\nDidn't see it coming.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, Shido-san... Are you bored?	
Message	Shido	Of course not. I'm ready for more.	
Message	Yoshino	I see. I'm glad.	
Message	None	(Yoshino sighed with relief.)	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, was it what you expected?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes, it was. But at the same time, I am
curious about what happens after."	
Message	None	"(This time, she wasn't using her usual
rehearsed line. Looks like Yoshino is
actually enjoying herself.)"	
Message	Shido	I see. Then let's keep going.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Wanna take a break?	
Message	Yoshino	I'm not tired, but, um... can I ask you a favor?	
Message	Shido	Sure. What's up?	
Message	Yoshino	Um...	
Message	Shido	Is it tough to ask?	
Message	Yoshinon	Hehehe. It's not what you're expecting,\nShido-kun.	
Message	Shido	What am I expecting...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Oh, come on. Don't play dumb. Yoshino,\nI think you should spit it out.	
Message	Shido	"I mean, if you need something, I don't mind
helping you. Just let me know."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, what were they doing in the drama...?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	None	"(Wh-What is she referring to? The story
is about careerism, but there were a lot
of scenes with couples, too.)"	
Message	None	"(Some pretty risque ones, too. What was
Yoshino hoping for...?)"	
Message	None	(I started turning red just thinking about it.)	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, are you okay?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I think so...?	
Message	Yoshino	Okay... I'm glad.	
Message	Yoshinon	PFFFT! Oh, Shido-kun. Were you hoping for\nsomething?	
Message	Shido	"Wh-what do you mean?! I wasn't hoping
for anything!"	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What are you thinking of...?	
Message	Shido	W-Well, it's nothing really.	
Message	Yoshinon	Right, right. Shido-kun, you don't seem like\nmuch of a self-starter.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Guess not.	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um. S-Sorry for saying... that I want you
to lie on my lap."	
Message	Shido	Th-That's fine. It wasn't weird at all!	
Message	None	"(Even with the movie playing, I can barely
focus on the TV.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank you.	
Message	Shido	No need to thank me.	
Message	Yoshinon	That's right. This is a date after all. If you\ncan't be friendly, then what's the point?	
Message	Yoshino	The point...?	
Message	Shido	A-Anyway, how's your lap? Am I heavy?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, I'm fine. Because it's you, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"Let me know if your legs get numb, okay?
I mean, it's happened to me before."	
Message	Yoshino	I-It has?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. When Kotori and I were kids, she'd
fall on my lap like this when we watched
TV."	
Message	Yoshino	When you were kids...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Hey, Earth to Shido-kun. You're here with\nYoshino. It's bad taste to bring up other\ngirls.	
Message	Shido	My sister doesn't count, does she?	
Message	Yoshinon	Hmm. Dubious.	
Message	Shido	Of course not.	
Message	Yoshinon	Gotcha. If she says so. But you aren't\ntalking enough about how soft her lap\nis.	
Message	Shido	...I can't really say.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	"I mean, it's not often that I place my head
on someone's lap. But, uh, it's nice."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I see. Glad to hear it.	
Message	None	"(I mean, I just feel awkward sitting on
someone's lap who's so much shorter
than me.)"	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(I couldn't move, so I continued watching
from this crooked angle.)"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, I'm sorry...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino ran her finger through my hair,
and I froze.)"	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's fine. Just tickled.	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino put her hand on my head and
wouldn't stop. I didn't hate it, but it made
me feel more self-conscious.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hehehe. What's the matter? You look kinda\nuncomfortable Shido-kun.	
Message	Shido	Well, um, that's not true.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um... Do you want to stop?	
Message	Shido	"I mean, I don't hate it, but I'm not used to
it."	
Message	Yoshinon	Whaaaaat? You flirt with so many girls and\nyou're afraid of a little petting?	
Message	Shido	"Why do you seem so surprised? I mean,
even hanging out with Yoshino makes me
nervous..."	
Message	Yoshino	...That's a relief.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Really? Sorry.	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, no. I wasn't talking about you being
friendly with other girls."	
Message	Yoshino	"But the fact... you're also... nervous when
you're with me."	
Message	Yoshinon	Jeez, Shido-kun. You're useless on that\nfront.	
Message	Shido	...Sorry.	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I didn't say... it was bad. I just feel...
relieved."	
Message	Shido	...Yeah? I feel so pathetic.	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um, I wouldn't like it... if you were used to
this."	
Message	Shido	"You wouldn't? I was just thinking to myself
that I wished I was there for you more."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, you're always there for me...	
Message	Shido	...You think so?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes. If not, I don't think... I would have fallen
for you."	
Message	Shido	...Thank you, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um...	
Message	Yoshinon	Woohoo! Oh, Yoshino. You're gonna tell\nhim? My, someone's feeling bold.	
Message	Shido	I...  I like you too.	
Message	Yoshino	...Oh! I appreciate that...	
Message	None	"(We looked at one another, giggling as the
ending credits played on the TV.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, the show's over.	
Message	Yoshino	Should we... rewatch it?	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	None	"(While Yoshino pet me on her lap, I fell
into a state of relaxation. I was soothed,
and suddenly felt very sleepy.)"	
Message	Yoshino	...Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Mm...	
Message	Yoshinon	Ahh. Shido-kun looks sleepy. Actually, he's\nalready passed out. He's horrible.	
Message	Yoshino	That's not true... Shido-san is...	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun is what...?	
Message	Yoshino	...An amazing person.	
Message	None	"(As I fell into a slumber, I thought I could
hear them talking, but it might have been
the TV.)"	
Message	None	"(I let the day wash over me, and slipped
into a deep sleep.)"
