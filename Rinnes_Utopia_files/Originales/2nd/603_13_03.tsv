Message	None	"(Since we were neighbors, whenever I got home
from school, Yoshino would come over to visit.)"	
Message	None	(Well, we are close, so it's not too surprising.)	
Message	None	"(The same occurred today, and Yoshino sat
in the living room, watching me work in the
kitchen.)"	
Message	Shido	"Want to have dinner with us tonight, Yoshino?
The menu is already set I'm afraid, so I can't
take any requests."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um... I-I'd love to join.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ah. Thank you so much, Shido-kun. I appreciate\nall of your hospitality."	
Message	Shido	"I don't mind. I mean, it's only one more serving,
so it isn't extra work or anything."	
Message	Yoshino	"The food you make... is delectable, Shido-san.
I understand why Tohka-san is so fond of it."	
Message	Shido	"I've made this dish plenty of times. It's not
like an especially good cook."	
Message	Yoshinon	"But men who cook are one in a million.\nMakes my heart skip a beat! You win points\nwith me!"	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. Thanks.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, Shido-san. I have a favor.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Yoshino	"After dinner, or any other day really, can
we have a sleepover...?"	
Message	None	(I froze.)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Woooooow! Yoshino, bold move! I can't\nbelieve you're making a move on Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	"At night? I don't mind, but why do you ask?
Did something scary happen?"	
Message	Yoshino	"No, it's not that... I wanted to go somewhere
else."	
Message	Shido	"Somewhere else? Sure. I can go with you.
Did you have somewhere in mind?"	
Message	None	"(Spirits were far, far older than they appeared.
Even so, it wouldn't be good for Yoshino to
walk alone at night.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Uh...	
Message	None	(After dinner, Yoshino returned to the house.)	
Message	None	"(Once the time to meet got closer, I quietly
snuck out of my house so I wouldn't wake
Kotori.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"At the end of the day, Shido-kun, you always\nput Kotori's needs first."	
Message	Shido	Only if it's within reason, okay?	
Message	Yoshino	Thank you... so much!	
Message	Shido	"You're welcome. I mean, I don't mind your
requests."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Does that mean you'd do anything that cute,\nlittle Yoshino would ask..."	
Choice		Within reason.	
Choice		Of course.	
Message	Shido	"That's not what I mean. I more so meant that
hers are easy to comply with."	
Message	Yoshino	I see..	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, I think you need to think before\nyou speak."	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yoshinon! That's what... makes Shido-san
special."	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay... Um. Thanks Yoshino.	
Message	None	(Hearing her say that makes me blush.)	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, u-um... That's how I really feel.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Woohoo! You two are too adorable. It's\nimportant to communicate if you want to\nget closer."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I... I... I'm not cute.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about? Yeah, you are.	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank you... very much.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun really looks dead serious, which\nmeans―"	
Message	Shido	Why...?	
Message	Yoshino	"Sh-Shido-san, if I weren't cute anymore, would
you not listen to me?"	
Message	Shido	I don't think... that would happen.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh. Why so hesitant?"	
Message	Shido	"If I can, then I want to be here for you however
you need me. It has nothing to do with how cute
you are, Yoshino."	
Message	Shido	"But we're here for each other now, so, um...
I do find you cute. At the end of the day, I'll
be there for you."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um... I-I don't know what to say...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido, you're such a smooth operator.\nYou're getting a kick from Yoshino's shyness."	
Message	Shido	That's not what I was trying to do!	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, but... Um... That makes me very happy.	
Message	Shido	Haha. You're going to make me blush.	
Message	None	(With that, Yoshino wanted me to take her to...)	
Message	Yoshino	Is this the place... with the lovely view?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You can see almost the entire city from
up here."	
Message	None	"(There are crater ruins in the middle of Tengu
City that are visible from Takadai Park, situated
beneath a gorgeous expanse of sky.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Amazing, Shido-kun! The fact that you fulfilled\nYoshino's request so quickly shows you've leveled\nup!"	
Message	Shido	Maybe. I'm happy you're both enjoying yourselves.	
Message	None	(Yoshino requested to see the stars...)	
Message	Yoshinon	"So, you decided to go out walking at this\nhour? Yoshino, you're such a bad girl..."	
Message	Yoshino	"S-Sorry... Yoshinon, but... I'm with Shido-san,
so I thought it'd be okay."	
Message	Shido	"Right. If you were alone, I would have said
no."	
Message	Yoshinon	"For some reason, I was afraid that Yoshino\nwould be in danger walking around with you,\nShido-kun."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san isn't... dangerous though?	
Message	Yoshinon	"I don't know about that. I mean, Shido-kun\nis a gentleman and all, Yoshino, but he is a\na man at the end of the day."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Besides, he seems to have taken a liking to\nhow cute you are. Anything can happen, don't\nyou think?"	
Message	Shido	I would never do anything to harm Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah, Yoshinon... I'm fine.	
Message	Yoshinon	"As long as he keeps his word."	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, sit over here. I'm sure standing
gets tiring after a while."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, okay...	
Message	None	(Yoshino walked over and sat beside me.)	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, do you enjoy looking at the stars?	
Message	Yoshino	Um, I don't know...	
Message	Shido	You don't know?	
Message	Yoshino	"All this time, I've never taken the time to
star-gaze..."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	"That's why... I was always curious. Now,
I have the chance to look at them. I have
you to thank for that, Shido-san..."	
Message	Shido	"I see. I'm happy to hear I could fulfill
your wish."	
Message	Yoshinon	"But she exchanged the favor with a kiss\nback then. Pretty courageous of her."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon...!	
Message	Shido	Oh, uh... Sorry about that.	
Message	Yoshino	"D-Don't apologize...! I don't think you did
anything wrong."	
Message	Shido	Glad to hear it.	
Message	Yoshino	I-Indeed...	
Message	None	(Yoshino then looked up at the sky.)	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	Hey, are you enjoying stargazing...?	
Message	Yoshino	S-Sorry... I don't know what to talk about.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, be romantic and discuss\nconstellations with her."	
Message	Shido	"Unfortunately, I don't know much about them.
I can point a few out, but that's about it."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gotcha. Yeah, you don't seem the type to\nstargaze as a hobby."	
Message	Shido	Right?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Totally. Unfortunately, Yoshino's not too\nversed in the subject either."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, really? I figured you would be, since you
suggested we come here."	
Message	Yoshino	S-Sorry...	
Message	Shido	"No need to apologize. I wish I looked up some
facts beforehand."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, no point in saying anything now."	
Message	Yoshino	"Even if I don't know much about stars,
I always thought... they were pretty..."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. They're real pretty, aren't they?	
Message	Yoshino	So... I think do... enjoy stargazing...	
Message	Shido	It's easy to get lost in.	
Message	None	"(It'd be far more enjoyable if I could point
out planets or different star clusters.)"	
Message	None	"(But putting that aside, there's something to
be said about staring up at the galaxy.)"	
Message	Shido	"Let me know if you'd like to do this again.
Hopefully next time, I'll have some facts to
share."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, right. I'll... do some research as well.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Why don't we visit a planetarium next time?	
Message	Yoshino	A planetarium...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I visited one on a field trip for school.
It's not space travel, but you see some neat
stuff."	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, I think I saw one on TV once. There were...
a lot of people."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, there are. It's like being in a theater.
I guess that doesn't appeal to you, huh?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, if it's with you Shido-san, I would like
to go some day."	
Message	Shido	I see. Then, let's go someday.	
Message	Yoshino	"Okay, but... the stars we see tonight...
So many of them... It's breathtaking."	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	None	"(Even though we couldn't tell any of the
stars apart from each other, it was, as she
said, breathtaking.)"	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san, have you ever seen such a starry
sky...?"	
Message	Shido	...Maybe once or twice recently.	
Message	None	"(Even so, there wasn't ever enough time to
take it all in.)"	
Message	Shido	I hope we can go with you someday, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't say 'someday'. Why not immediately?"	
Message	Shido	"Hm. I feel like I can to a certain extent, or
maybe not."	
Message	Yoshino	Really...?	
Message	Shido	Like... I can ask Kotori.	
Message	Yoshinon	"What, you have to rely on another girl?\nShido-kun, that's lame."	
Message	Shido	Agh...! Point taken... Sorry.	
Message	Yoshino	I... I'm fine, even if that were the case...!	
Message	Shido	"I don't want you to be be fine with that.
You know what? I won't rely on anyone else.
I'll show you the starriest sky that ever was."	
Message	Yoshino	Hehehe. I look forward to it.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, leave it to me.	
Message	Yoshinon	"But Shido-kun, you're a busy boy.\nI wonder when you'll actually do it."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I... can wait. Shido-san, I have faith...
that you'll keep your promise one day."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino leaned back on me, and I put my
arm around her shoulder.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Hehe. You're warm...	
Message	Shido	...So are you.	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, Shido-san, could we talk about something...?
What did you learn from the planetarium when
you went with your school?"	
Message	Shido	"The story has to do with a different season.
Is that okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes. I want to hear... what you have to say.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Well, it was about the constellation,
Cygnus."	
Message	Yoshino	...Cygnus? So... in the milky way?	
Message	Shido	"No, not exactly. Cygnus has this star called
Albireo, and―uh, what was it...?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hahaha. You're so unreliable."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, the field trip took place a long time
ago. It's not like I was paying attention the
whole time."	
Message	Yoshino	What else do you remember...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, hm... I believe Albireo is a binary star.
From afar, it looks like one star, but there's
actually two."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh. Color me impressed, Shido-kun."	
Message	Shido	Don't patronize me.	
Message	Yoshino	...I'd like to see that some day.	
Message	Shido	"Next time, we can bring binoculars. I've
heard using those allows you to see the
whole sky clearly."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Man, Shido-kun, never knew you had\nthat kind of info in you."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, sorry... I'll make sure to have some stuff
for us to look at next time."	
Message	Yoshino	...I already cannot wait.	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino continued to ask me questions about
random tidbits I knew. Before we knew it, it was
almost midnight.)"	
Message	Shido	...Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Mm... Zzz...	
Message	None	(Looks like Yoshino fell asleep on me.)	
Message	Shido	...She's knocked out.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...san...	
Message	None	(Yoshino was leaning on me, dead asleep.)	
Message	None	"(It might be tough to wake her up, and I'd
feel bad for doing so.)"	
Message	Shido	It is pretty late....	
Message	None	"(Yoshino wasn't much of a night owl, so it
wasn't a surprise.)"	
Message	None	"(Until Yoshino woke up, I lost myself in the
stars.)"
