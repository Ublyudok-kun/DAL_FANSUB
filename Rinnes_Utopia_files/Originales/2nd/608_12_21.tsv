Message	Shido	Mm... Mmmh... Hm? It's... morning.	
Message	None	"(Huh? When did I fall asleep? I feel like I was
just with everyone else.)"	
Message	None	"(That's right. I was testing a game, and entered
the digital world. There, I met a mysterious girl.
Maria Arusu. Then, everyone else followed...)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, it was just a dream. Of course. Something
that crazy couldn't possibly be real."	
Message	Shido	"I just had the strangest dream...
I guess I'll make some breakfast."	
Message	None	"(Huh? Is that noise coming from the kitchen?
That smell, it smells like miso soup.)"	
Message	Shido	Who's making breakfast?	
Message	Kotori	......	
Message	Shido	"Morning, Kotori. What's wrong? Why the
long fa―Good morning..."	
Message	Maria	......	
Message	Kotori	......	
Message	Shido	Um, Maria...?	
Message	Maria	Yes.	
Message	None	(...So it really wasn't a dream.)	
Message	Shido	"Huh, but how is it morning? I only remember
up to yesterday afternoon..."	
Message	Maria	"Yesterday, I had reset this world. It is morning
because the world is currently restarting its
cycle."	
Message	Kotori	"In other words, at the time, it looks like a
""New Game+"". The game's restarted on the
first day."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	So, why are you in our house?	
Message	Maria	"To observe Shido, so as to ascertain the origins
of love and how it is nurtured."	
Message	None	"(Wait, I thought she only referred to me as
Shido Itsuka. For some reason, she's calling
me by a different name.)"	
Message	Kotori	"So you're watching Shido now, are you?
Whatever. For now, we decided that we'd go
along with Arusu's scheme."	
Message	Shido	I see. That's why you're in our house, Maria.	
Message	Kotori	...Shido. Is this girl's name Maria?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Of course it is. Maria Arusu. She asked me
to call her Maria."	
Message	Maria	Yes, I did in fact ask you this.	
Message	Kotori	...Is that so? Hmm... Well, whatever?	
Message	Shido	So then, what's for breakfast?	
Message	Maria	"I prepared something this morning. I will serve
the meal on the table, so please wait."	
Message	Shido	You made this, Maria?	
Message	Maria	Yes. Please sit down, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. Maria, so you cook... That's, um, sort
of unexpected."	
Message	Maria	"I have accumulated recipe data up until now,
which explains how my cooking has improved.
My cooking is on equal footing to yours, Shido."	
Message	Kotori	"That's quite the claim. Since Shido's only real
skill is cooking."	
Message	Shido	Only real skill... That's a little harsh.	
Message	None	"(Still, ""data up until now"" is a little peculiar.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, why don't we dig in? We have class soon,
after all."	
Message	None	"(Maria had finished laying out the dishes
onto the table.)"	
Message	Shido	"Rice, miso soup, and grilled fish.
Talk about a balanced meal."	
Message	Maria	"According to the database, this meal is common
for the Itsuka household."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's true. Did you really make this,
Maria?"	
Message	Maria	Yes... Um, is there an issue?	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it. It's just surprising, maybe
something just feels off."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, she made us breakfast, so just eat it
or we'll be late."	
Message	Shido	Y-You're right. Thank you, Maria.	
Message	Maria	"Of course... All I did was predict your
breakfast patterns."	
Message	None	"(Maria was acting timid. They called her an AI,
but she really looked no different from a normal
girl. Kinda strange.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. Time for breakfast.	
Message	None	"(As I put my hands together in gratitude for
the meal, Maria seemed to follow suit.)"	
Message	Maria	Time for breakfast.	
Message	None	"(Maria mimicked my posture, and very
carefully fed herself a mouthful of rice.
It was so natural.)"	
Message	None	"(I also took a bite of the salmon filet, and
sipped the miso soup.)"	
Message	Shido	"Delicious. Not too thick or too thin, just
the right amount of flavor."	
Message	Kotori	"It can't be, but there's no mistake. It tastes
exactly like the breakfast you make, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. Now that you mention it,
the flavors are really similar."	
Message	Maria	"Because I am precisely recreating Shido's
cooking methods, the taste should be
indistinguishable."	
Message	Shido	Wow. Amazing. I'm impressed.	
Message	Maria	"I do not have much experience in actually
cooking, so I was uncertain as to whether or
not I could reproduce it faithfully."	
Message	Shido	"Even if you learned just by observing, that's
still a big accomplishment. Maria, you might
have a talent for cooking, you know?"	
Message	Maria	"No. It is because your cooking is delicious,
Shido. I only copied you."	
Message	Shido	Don't be so modest, Maria.	
Message	None	"(And so, while we continued praising Maria,
she continued displaying humility, and we
all finished our breakfast.)"	
Message	None	"(After our meal, Maria began washing the
dishes.)"	
Message	None	"(Although I offered to help, she refused,
so I sat in a chair next to Kotori while she
enjoyed a cup of tea.)"	
Message	Shido	"It was almost a perfect recreation. Do you
think it's because we're in a simulation?"	
Message	Kotori	It'd be reasonable to think so, but...	
Message	Kotori	"Are such minute details like your cooking
habits really being logged into a database?"	
Message	Shido	"Wouldn't Reine-san or someone else have
set it up?"	
Message	Kotori	Hmmm...	
Message	None	(Hmm...)	
Message	Kotori	"Well, whatever. Either way, we should think
critically about what we're to do from here."	
Message	Shido	Do from here? Aren't we heading to school?	
Message	Kotori	"Correct, but if we follow our routines aimlessly,
then we may never get to escape from this world."	
Message	Shido	"I guess our best move would be to find the
answer to the question Maria is wondering
about. What is love...?"	
Message	Kotori	"To that end, we're stuck living in this digital
world, right? Doesn't that mean we should act
while we know Arusu's gathering info on love?"	
Message	Shido	"You can't be telling me that I need to date
Tohka and the others again..."	
Message	Kotori	"That's exactly it. We're in a dating sim, so even
if we wait, some event might trigger. We have
to take advantage of it whenever it does."	
Message	Kotori	"If she were just making you play a dating sim,
then NPCs would have worked, but that's not the
case. Arusu brought us here. That means something."	
Message	Shido	"Then people who were originally targets to
date were summoned here too, right? Well, I
guess that isn't much different than real life."	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. Either way, do your best to find
out what the meaning of love is."	
Message	Shido	"I guess it means I should go on a date. Hmm.
I wonder if that will help us get to the bottom
of it."	
Message	Maria	On that note, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Maria. Are you finished washing the dishes?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I made sure to clean all of them.
So, about where to go from here, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Maria	Would you kindly go on a date with me?	
Message	Shido	Huh?! With you, Maria?!	
Message	Maria	"It is true that observing your cultivation of
love is informational to me. However, there is
much I won't understand until I experience it."	
Message	Kotori	I see. Makes sense to me.	
Message	Shido	So you want me to go on a date with you, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"In this world, the only person suitable to date
me is... you, Shido. You are the only one."	
Message	Shido	That may be true, but...	
Message	None	"(Like Maria says, the only guy in this world
who isn't an NPC is me, so this is quite the
sudden proposal.)"	
Message	Kotori	Hmm... It's fine, don't you think?	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, even if we decided to follow through,
there's no guarantee I'll do it right, you know?"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I'll leave the final decision up to you,
Shido. Doing so might be the key to our escape."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I suppose experiencing it first-hand
is better, but..."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. By doing so, I am expecting to obtain
valuable data on what love is."	
Message	None	"(The problem is in whether or not I'll be
able to do things right, but I guess there's
no sense in being indecisive.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. I'll think about it.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Thank you very much. I do not wish
to force you into it, so please do what feels
right in your heart, Shido."	
Message	Kotori	"Hm. Well then, now that's decided, let's head
to class. Arusu, you're coming to school with us,
right?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. I am set to be a transfer student.	
Message	Shido	"So you'll become our classmate, Maria.
That means all of us will be at the same
school, huh?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It seems to be the best method of
constructing necessary events."	
Message	None	(This sounds like a lot to handle...)	
Message	None	"(When I opened the front door, the Spirits
living in the Spirit Mansion had gathered.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm. So Arusu will be coming with us as
well?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that seems to be the case.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm... Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Good morning, Yoshino. You're going too, huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino's become a teacher! Isn't it amazing?\nShe'll give you a lesson you'll never forget!	
Message	Shido	I see. So that's your role, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	"Umm. I'm not sure... if I can do it, but I'll
try my best!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I'm looking forward to learning from
you too."	
Message	Kaguya	"Ku ku. To think that the ""World Administrator
herself would participate. What a tangled web
we weave. Heh. The winds rage onward."""	
Message	Maria	"I have no desire to cause an uproar. Let us
get along."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Question. Is your decision to join us at all
influenced by yesterday's matter? By accompanying
us, you will be educated in matters of love."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. An accurate deduction. I am observing
everyone in order to learn about love. I think
spending time with you all will aid me."	
Message	Shido	Well, whatever the case is, please be nice.	
Message	Kotori	"There are a couple of people absent here,
aren't there?"	
Message	Tohka	"Come to think of it, I do not see them. Perhaps
they are traveling separately?"	
Message	Kotori	"I mean, we'll probably run into them at school.
No need to worry. For now, let's get going."	
Message	None	(Afterward, we all walked together to class.)	
Message	Kaguya	"So you've come here as a transfer student, Arusu.
Which class is yours?"	
Message	Maria	I will be in Shido's class.	
Message	Tohka	Ohh, then it is the same as me.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Dissatisfaction. It's unfair that only Kaguya
and I are in a different class. We'd like to be
with Shido."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, not everyone's gonna be in the same class,
right? There wouldn't be enough desks. It looks
like I'm in this room, since I skipped a grade."	
Message	Shido	"If everyone were together, that'd be chaos,
so this works, doesn't it? Either way, we'll
all get together at break, right?"	
Message	None	"(It's already gotten so noisy, and not
everyone is here yet.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh my. Look at all the happy faces grouped
together."	
Message	Shido	Whoa, Kurumi. Where'd you come from?	
Message	Kurumi	"I was in the neighborhood. It seemed like
a lovely day to take a stroll by your school."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... You just happened to take a stroll.	
Message	Kurumi	"Since I'm here already, I will join you.
Despite the nuisance from Arusu-san."	
Message	Maria	"I suppose in normal circumstances, having
this many people walking together would
present a logistical issue."	
Message	Shido	"Nah. I don't think there's a reason to let
that kind of stuff bother you. Don't you think?"	
Message	Kurumi	"It's as Shido-san says. This is a transient world,
after all. We must find a means with which to
escape as soon as we can."	
Message	Maria	Yes. I suppose that is true...	
Message	None	"(Maria's reaction to Kurumi's comment was
forlorn, and she pointed her eyes at the ground.
It was the most human-like I'd ever seen her.)"	
Message	Miku	Helloooo, darling. Good morning.	
Message	Shido	Oh. You're coming too, Miku?	
Message	Miku	Oh, is Arusu-san going to school too～?	
Message	Maria	Yes. I wish to broaden my scope of experiences.	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee. You're adorable. Hey Arusu-san,
wanna get tea with me some time?"	
Message	Maria	"Tea? Sipped over light conversation at a
café? Am I correctly framing the proposal?"	
Message	Miku	Yep. We can talk all day and take our time.	
Message	Shido	Hey hey, don't start trying to pick her up.	
Message	Miku	Goodness. Feeling jealous, darling?	
Message	Shido	"Of course not. Come on. We're going to
be late."	
Message	Miku	Aww, darling. You're so mean!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, this is where I go...	
Message	Shido	"Ah, gotcha. You're heading to the teacher's
office. See ya later."	
Message	Maria	"Shido, I will also head to the office. I am a
transfer student after all."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.	
Message	Maria	Looking forward to what?	
Message	Shido	"Well, for you to become our classmate,
Maria."	
Message	Maria	Oh, yes... Um, I will be seeing you...	
Message	Shido	Hmm? She was acting a little strange.	
Message	Shido	"No. I'm just reading too much into it. I'd
better pull myself together and head to class."	
Message	Shido	...Oh?	
Message	None	"(Just then, I bumped into someone trotting
out of the classroom.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami. You're early.	
Message	Origami	"I arrived here to check if there were any
dangerous items hidden around."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. It's true. The world might not look
much different, but it is."	
Message	Origami	"There was nothing particularly suspicious.
There are, however, more desks inside of the
classroom than usual."	
Message	Shido	"It's because Kurumi and Maria have transferred
here, huh?"	
Message	Origami	"Most likely, yes. I learned of this by collecting
information from the staff. I was able to
ensure nothing here will endanger you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Right. Is that why my gym clothes are in
your hands?"	
Message	Origami	I was checking for dangerous items.	
Message	Shido	"In my gym clothes? You said you came early
to investigate, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, what's the matter? Are you not coming
to class?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'm going now.	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, there are more people in class than
usual, but it's exciting."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you're right. Class is always pretty lively,
but this time feels different for some reason."	
Message	Shido	"It doesn't feel like how it used to be at all.
Why is that? Oh well."	
Message	Tohka	Yes, Shido. Let's head into class together.	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami. Only two persons can fit in
through a classroom door at one time. Shido
has already decided to enter class with me."	
Message	Tohka	"Rgh. Shido will enter with me. You can
follow behind us, Origami Tobiichi."	
Message	Origami	You should be the one to enter afterwards.	
Message	Tohka	I was thinking the same for you!	
Message	Shido	I'm going ahead...	
Message	None	(Um, I guess some things never change...)
