Message	None	"(Okay, I'm going to go check on Miku. I wonder if
she's ever cooked before.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey Miku. I came to help.	
Message	Miku	"Aww, darling... Did you come here to watch
me cook?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I came to help.	
Message	Miku	Oh, you came to help me? I'm so happy.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I was kind of bored... So what are you
making, Miku?"	
Message	Miku	Curry rice. I figured that boys loved it.	
Message	Shido	Curry, huh? That's great.	
Message	Miku	Yay～ My darling praised me.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I just heard what you were making. I still
can't let my guard down. It's too early to be
happy."	
Message	Miku	Then please give it a taste.	
Message	Shido	Let's see... *grunt*...!	
Message	Miku	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Miku... you were making curry, right?	
Message	Miku	Yes, I was.	
Message	Shido	"Th-This is weird... Whatever's in the pot doesn't
look like curry."	
Message	Miku	"I called my friend at school, and she gave me so
many tips! Before I knew it, the curry ended up
like this!"	
Message	Shido	"It sounds like you took too much advice... Uh, how
did it turn out like this?"	
Message	Miku	"Don't worry. The color may be a bit on the exotic
side, but it should taste like curry!"	
Message	Shido	"But look at it. I don't even know what color
to call it."	
Message	Shido	"At the very least, I don't think it's a color you
should put in your mouth."	
Message	Miku	"It'll be fine. It smells like ordinary curry,
after all."	
Message	Shido	Y-You have a point.	
Message	Miku	Now darling, give it a go.	
Message	Shido	"Th-Then... I guess I'll approach it like I'm
bungee-jumping."	
Message	Shido	...*Grunt*! This is...!	
Message	Miku	What do you think?	
Message	Shido	"I-It's ordinary curry... Just ordinary curry to
the point that I don't even know what to say."	
Message	Miku	"Right? I'm almost done, so you wait over there,
okay darling?"	
Message	None	"(...Something doesn't feel right. How could it
taste so normal with that color...)"
