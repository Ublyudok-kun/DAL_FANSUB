Message	Shido	...*Gasp*!	
Message	Shido	Where... am I?	
Message	Shido	School... hallway...?	
Message	Shido	This isn't good. I can't remember anything.	
Message	Shido	I must have left the classroom to go somewhere.	
Message	Tonomachi	Hey, Itsuka. There you are.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	What's the matter? Are you in a daze or something?	
Message	Shido	Oh. Tonomachi. What's the matter?	
Message	Tonomachi	What do you mean? I was looking for you.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What do you want?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Nothing at all. But you should know a certain club
senpai is looking for you. I just came by to deliver
the message since I figured you missed me too."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Club? Tonomachi, you're in a club?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah! One might argue that I'm the MVP of the ol'
swim team, despite what others might think."	
Message	Shido	"Swim team? I bet you anything you're after girls'
swimsuits, aren't you? God, you're so predictable."	
Message	Tonomachi	Well, that is true! But... HEY! You're a member, too!	
Message	Shido	Oh... that's right, I am...	
Message	None	"(He's right. Tonomachi and I joined the swim team
together. We both said something about... wanting to
be more free.)"	
Message	Shido	Ah... So I was heading to the swim club.	
Message	Tonomachi	...What's gotten into you, Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	Nothing.	
Message	Tonomachi	"You're pouting because you couldn't enter the swim
meet, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	Swim meet?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah. The one we were timed for the other day. The
one where you didn't qualify?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, really?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Itsuka, now isn't the time to be nonchalant. With that
kind of attitude, you really won't be able to enter.
Don't forget how mad Tama-chan got at you for it."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Come to think of it, you're right.	
Message	Tonomachi	Really now. You're a swimmer, not a surfer.	
Message	Shido	Well... Uh, don't worry about me.	
Message	Tonomachi	That's probably why your times aren't improving.	
Message	Shido	You could be right.	
Message	Tonomachi	But, thanks to that you're... Ugh, damn it!	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Don't give me that, you con-artist! I told you our
senpai is calling for you. She wants to talk to you
specifically about your times."	
Message	Shido	Talk...? So, who wants to talk to me?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Argh! Damn it! I'm so bitter! I don't even want to
tell you anymore!"	
Message	Shido	Uh, tell me...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Miku-tan Senpai, you idiot! The one with the big
boobies! The ace of the swim team! She said she
wants to talk to you on the rooftop! Alone!"	
Message	Shido	Oh.	
Message	Tonomachi	Why don't you care?! Ugh, I'm so jealous.	
Message	Shido	You're so honest about your desires...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Shut up! I mean it's Miku-tan Senpai we're talking
about! All of us on the team joined because of her!
Why do you get all her attention?!"	
Message	Shido	"But she's going to talk to me about my time, right?
That means she's going to scold me..."	
Message	None	"(And what does he mean, I get all her attention? I
don't remember getting any attention...)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah! Lucky bastard! What I wouldn't give to see
Miku-tan all hot and bothered about me!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sure, sure... Anyways, I guess I'll go see what
she has to say. The rooftop, right?"	
Message	Tonomachi	What?! Hey?! Don't ignore me. Hey!	
Message	None	"(Hm... I heard him keep talking, but whatever. It's
Tonomachi.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	Damn it! I hope you get cursed!	
Message	None	"(I'm going to ignore his negativity and focus on going
upstairs.)"	
Message	None	(Well, here I am.)	
Message	None	(Senpai will be here, right?)	
Message	Shido	Hm? That's...	
Message	Miku	There you are, darling. I was waiting for you!	
Message	None	"Just as Tonomachi said, the one that approached me
was... Um, how do I put it... A student with large
breasts."	
Message	Shido	Senpai... right? Of the swim club.	
Message	Miku	That's right, darling.	
Message	Shido	Um... You call me darling?	
Message	Miku	Yes. What about it?	
Message	Shido	Well you don't call the others that...	
Message	Miku	Huh? But your name is darling, isn't it?	
Message	Shido	*Cough*! Of course that's not my name!	
Message	Miku	"What? Really～? I always thought it was something
like Gagaring or Sterling. Some name like that, you
know～"	
Message	Shido	What am I, some foreigner?! I'm 100% Japanese.	
Message	Miku	"Oh is that so～ But I remember you as darling～
Listen to it. The way it flows out of my mouth...
It suits you."	
Message	Shido	"But, why did you remember me as that in the first
place..."	
Message	Miku	"But I can't change it now～ Can't we just say darling
is your nickname?"	
Message	Shido	Fine... This is tiring, so whatever. Go ahead.	
Message	None	(It feels pointless trying to argue with her...)	
Message	Miku	Hey, darling? Let's cut to the chase.	
Message	Shido	Sure. So you want to talk about...	
Message	Miku	"The meet, darling. I heard you didn't meet the
minimum time to enter the race."	
Message	Shido	I-I heard...	
Message	Miku	"At this rate, you'd be the only person on our team
who can't enter."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. So I'm the only reject...?	
Message	Miku	That's right～ Your friend Tonomachi-kun is the ace...	
Message	Shido	What? What did you just say...?	
Message	Miku	I told you, Tonomachi-kun is our great ace.	
Message	Shido	"What?! No way! That's a lie! THE TONOMACHI?!
I mean, are we talking about the same guy here?!"	
Message	Miku	"I'm not lying～ Judging by his time, I'm sure this
meet will be his chance to aim for a personal best～"	
Message	Shido	"What... I never thought Tonomachi would beat me at
that. For some reason, it's really disturbing..."	
Message	Miku	Right? Then you have to practice.	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay... But practicing now would probably be too
late."	
Message	Miku	"There's still time to enter, so if you train hard, you
can improve!"	
Message	Shido	"Train hard... If that's what's going to make me
faster."	
Message	Miku	Let's do it, darling. I'll practice with you.	
Message	Shido	You... will?	
Message	Miku	"Well, I'll do some one-on-one coaching with you until
the meet. Brace yourself!"	
Message	Shido	What?! You will?! I mean, one-on-one with you?!	
Message	Miku	It'll be our secret training.	
Message	Shido	The two of us?!	
Message	Miku	Yes, the two of us!	
Message	Shido	What... Well, that kind of makes me happy.	
Message	Miku	"Hehe. I'm glad～ So, let's start. How about to warm
up... 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats, and..."	
Message	Shido	"What?! H-Hey, that's pretty hardcore from the get-go!
I mean, this is the rooftop!"	
Message	Miku	No questions asked. Now start!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay!	
Message	Shido	*Wheeze, wheeze*...	
Message	Miku	Okay, this is the perfect warm-up.	
Message	Shido	"*Pant, pant*... This is... a warm-up... I'm at my
limit..."	
Message	Miku	"What are you talking about, darling? You have to do
at least this much every day, or your time won't
improve～ So let's go and practice at the pool now."	
Message	Shido	...Th-This is harder... than I anticipated...	
Message	Miku	Now, darling. Have you changed?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes...	
Message	None	(Of course she's in her swimsuit, too. Her figure...)	
Message	Miku	What's the matter, darling? Let's get started.	
Message	Shido	"Yes, Boo... I mean, uh... W-We're going to get in the
water?"	
Message	Miku	"Yes～ But before that, which race do you want to
enter?"	
Message	Shido	Which race? Oh yeah, huh...	
Message	Miku	"Depending on which one you're going to do, the
practice menu will be different so we should decide
on that first."	
Message	None	(Hm...Which one should I enter?)	
Choice		Freestyle.	
Choice		Backstroke.	
Choice		Relay with Senpai.	
Message	Shido	I was thinking the freestyle.	
Message	Miku	Freestyle, huh? I think that'll be fine.	
Message	Shido	Y-You think?	
Message	Miku	"Looking at your personal best, I think you'd have the
best chance at the freestyle."	
Message	Shido	I-I thought so, too. Freestyle is my only chance!	
Message	Miku	"And besides, I also feel like freestyle is the best in
general. I think a man that's fast at freestyle is
amazing～"	
Message	Shido	Oh, those words. Totally pumping me up!	
Message	Miku	*Giggle*... Then let's give it our all!	
Message	Shido	Okay!	
Message	None	"(Whoa.. At first I was worried, but I feel like she's
cheering me on. Now I feel like I can do it.)"	
Message	None	"(I mean, the swim team ace—Miku-senpai—is going
to train me herself.)"	
Message	None	(Alone. Just the two of us!)	
Message	Miku	All right, let's stretch and get in the water...	
Message	None	(Oh, no...?!)	
Message	Miku	What's the matter, darling?	
Message	None	(Because I had unnecessary things on my mind...)	
Message	None	(I'm super conscious of Senpai's body...!)	
Message	Miku	Hey, darling?!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?!	
Message	Miku	Don't look at me like that! I'm getting embarrassed!	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... Sorry. I let my guard down...	
Message	Miku	Gosh... You bad boy～ Now, let's start practice.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. I'll do my best.	
Message	Shido	I want to do the backstroke.	
Message	Miku	So you prefer the backside, darling?	
Message	Shido	"What?! Backside...? I don't know if... I prefer it or
not..."	
Message	Miku	Darling, is there something wrong?	
Message	Shido	Huh? What are you talking about?	
Message	Miku	"Gosh, darling. I was talking about the backstroke.
Where you swim on your "backside"!"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh yeah. Of course I'm talking about swimming,
too. Well, I like the backside. Yes."	
Message	Miku	Is that true? Gosh...	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. See, you know how when you're doing a
backstroke, you're on your back? I like to look up at
the stars while I swim in the outdoor pool."	
Message	Miku	What... darling...	
Message	Shido	...Did I say something weird?	
Message	Miku	"No. You have the same reasoning as me...! The
reason why I like the backstroke."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you too?	
Message	Miku	Yes, so my backside is really developed!	
Message	Shido	I-I see.	
Message	Miku	"But, hmm... If you like backstrokes, then I can totally
teach you."	
Message	Shido	That's nice, but please go easy on me...	
Message	Miku	No. If I'm teaching you, I need you to hit your time.	
Message	Shido	Ahhh!	
Message	Miku	Now, let's go. Follow me, darling!	
Message	Shido	"I would like to do the relay with you. It has to be
you."	
Message	Miku	Darling... You're so serious...	
Message	Shido	Please Senpai. I... I'll do it!	
Message	Miku	But, darling... I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	Y-You don't want to...?	
Message	Miku	"You see, there are no relays in this meet... Not to
mention they wouldn't pair a male and a female
together."	
Message	Shido	I-I knew that...!	
Message	Miku	"It's touching to hear you say that, but let's not mess
around. Let's be serious, okay?"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry!	
Message	Miku	"Gosh. So, let's have you enter the freestyle. That'll
be the most promising."	
Message	Shido	Okay, let's go with that.	
Message	Miku	Let's do this, darling.	
Message	Shido	Okay, Senpai. Please train me!	
Message	None	"(Practicing alone with her. Although she was strict,
it was such a nice time spent together...)"
