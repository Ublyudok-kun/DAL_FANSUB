Message	Shido	ACHOO!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido? What's the matter? Are you cold?	
Message	None	"(While walking home from school, I had an
intense sneeze, prompting Tohka to get up
close to me.)"	
Message	Shido	"You know, it's been getting chilly recently,
hasn't it? You okay, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	"Don't worry. I'm just warm and fuzzy from
being with you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	...Ah, right!	
Message	None	"(Tohka puffed her chest out proudly. I had
no idea how to respond.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing. I was just feeling shy.	
Message	Tohka	R-Really? Sorry...	
Message	Shido	No, no. It's nothing to apologize for.	
Message	None	"(I shook my head and played off the fact
that I was taken aback.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka had a gift for startling me. I thought
I'd get used to it by now, but it's still
something I get shy over.)"	
Message	None	"(Especially when Tohka doted upon me.
Ever since we started dating, she's been
willing to wait on me, hand and knee.)"	
Message	None	"(But there are times when I can't help but
feel shy about it. Especially when it comes
from out of nowhere.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, what is the matter? Are you ill?	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm fine. Got some stuff on my mind.
It's not a cold or anything."	
Message	Tohka	"Are you certain? When temperatures drop, I
hear it is easier to get sick. I do not want you
to get sick."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'll be careful.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, do you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Shido	..T-Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm. You are not hot.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Thanks.	
Message	None	"(Tohka's cool hand felt nice on my forehead,
but being in the middle of the street made me
panic. At least it was just her hand...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, your face is turning red. Perhaps you
are sick."	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm totally fine! It really isn't a cold,
so don't worry about it."	
Message	Tohka	Hm. You are sure? Well, okay... BUT!	
Message	Shido	But what?	
Message	Tohka	"If you feel any symptoms, be sure to tell me,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Tohka. Take care of yourself too, okay?	
Message	Tohka	Right! So long as I have you, I'll be fine!	
Message	None	"(There she goes again with that stuff.
I pretended to shrug it off as I continued
walking.)"	
Message	None	(But in truth, it warmed my heart a bit.)	
Message	Shido	"It's only going to get colder, though. I need
to start wearing layers."	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, you don't have many
winter clothes, do you?"	
Message	None	"(Tohka's life is supported by Ratatoskr.
I bet they give her new clothes, too.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Reine gave me some, I believe. However I
have yet to purchase some for myself."	
Message	Shido	"All right! Then, why don't we take a look
at some outfits tomorrow?"	
Message	None	"(I just realized this is Tohka's first winter.
She's never picked out winter clothes before,
so it could be a new, fun experience for her.)"	
Message	Tohka	Okay. It's a date! I can't wait!	
Message	Shido	Yup. It's a date.	
Message	None	"(Saying that still makes me blush, but I should
be used to it. We've gone on plenty of dates
by now.)"	
Message	Shido	"Let's meet tomorrow at the shopping district
at 11."	
Message	Tohka	Understood! I am already so excited!	
Message	Tohka	"So the plan is for Shido... to pick exactly
whichever outfits he prefers me in, right?!"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Tohka	N-Nothing! See you at supper!	
Message	Shido	Okay, later.	
Message	None	"(It was the next day, 11 on the dot. Tohka
had arrived right on time.)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido. I am sorry. Did I keep you waiting?	
Message	Shido	No, I just got here too. Morning, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Okay, morning!	
Message	Tohka	So, um, what do you think? Is my outfit strange?	
Message	None	(Tohka asked me sheepishly.)	
Message	None	"(She wore stockings and a mini-skirt. Her
legs were so long and alluring.)"	
Message	None	"(Bu-But that skirt sure is short. Well, her
outfit wasn't anything out of the ordin―)"	
Message	None	"(What am I doing...? We're about to go on
a date, and I'm having these thoughts.)"	
Message	Shido	"If you were worried about being late, you
could've just come with me."	
Message	Tohka	"N-No, I can't! Then it would not be like a
date, right?"	
Message	Shido	Well, not to me...	
Message	Tohka	"Ai and the girls had said so. They said, in
order for it to be an official date, we must
meet separately."	
Message	Shido	"Sure, I guess that makes sense. Oh well.
Whatever. Let's go."	
Message	Tohka	Okay! On the hunt for winter clothes!	
Message	Shido	"All right. Let's get going. I hope we can find
you something nice."	
Message	None	"(There were plenty of clothing stores, but I'm
not too aware of what they sell. Guess we can
hit stores we're used to.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm. A breeze keeps tingling my legs.	
Message	Shido	Tohka, what's the matter?	
Message	Tohka	Fue?!	
Message	Tohka	A-About what?	
Message	Shido	Oh. You just seemed uncomfortable.	
Message	Tohka	Th-That's not true at all!	
Message	Shido	You sure? If you say so.	
Message	None	"(For some reason, Tohka's having difficulty
walking. I wonder if her feet hurt. But I think
she would've said something.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I guess I'll just keep an eye out for
that.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, we're here.	
Message	Tohka	OH! So many cute clothes.	
Message	None	"(There was a section for winter attire, which
immediately caught Tohka's eye.)"	
Message	Shido	"Looks like they've got a seasonal section.
Why don't you pick out what you like?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Just one? Kotori said I can purchase
however much I want..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry. That's not what I meant. I'll buy
you one outfit myself. It's your first winter,
right? Let's ring it in in style."	
Message	Tohka	Are you sure about that?	
Message	Shido	Of course. That's why we came here.	
Message	None	"(It's a celebration. I can't afford designer
clothes, but I can do this much for her.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori told me she would spot me if I didn't
have enough, but I denied it. It's pointless if
I can't buy it with my own money.)"	
Message	None	"(I have to look dependable. When I said that
to Kotori, she just laughed.)"	
Message	Tohka	"But there are many shopgoers. I am unsure
if I can wear it and get your opinion."	
Message	Shido	"Go ahead and choose what you want, Tohka.
You might find that you'll want to shop more
in the future, too. It's all good experience."	
Message	Tohka	Got it! I shall pick out items for myself.	
Message	Tohka	Hey, Shido? What's this?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Is that a scarf?	
Message	Tohka	Scarf? What interesting fabric. How do I use it?	
Message	Shido	"You wrap it around your shoulders, knees, or
body. It's pretty cozy."	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Like this?	
Message	Shido	Right. You look great in it.	
Message	None	"(After wrapping herself in the checkered
scarf, Tohka looked totally different.)"	
Message	None	"(She looked like a bookish librarian. Her long
hair was tucked neatly inside of the scarf, which
hugged her thin frame. Cute pattern, too.)"	
Message	None	"(If she were reading a book, sitting beside a
windowsill, it would be a lovely scene.)"	
Message	Tohka	"...But Shido, this makes it difficult to eat.
I think I would get it dirty."	
Message	None	(Seems like she had other plans in mind.)	
Message	Shido	"Well, you'd be wearing clothes underneath it,
so you could just remove it before you eat."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, I see! That should be fine, then.	
Message	None	"(Tohka appeared satisfied, and placed the scarf
back on the rack.)"	
Message	Tohka	"There are too many clothes to choose from.
Shido, what catches your eye?"	
Message	Shido	"Um... Wait, no! Today, you're choosing for
yourself, right Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes... That's true, but...	
Message	Shido	You can do it.	
Message	Tohka	Okay, I'll try! Hm...? There are shoes, too.	
Message	None	"(Tohka stopped at the back of the store.
Come to think of it, something was bothering
her earlier. Maybe her shoes don't match.)"	
Message	Shido	"Wanna try these out? Sit there. I'll grab you
a pair."	
Message	Tohka	Then, can you get me those boots?	
Message	Shido	Sure. Leave it to me.	
Message	None	(Okay, these boots.)	
Message	Shido	Sorry for the wait.	
Message	Tohka	Okay. Thanks Shido. Hold on.	
Message	None	"(Tohka slipped her foot into the boots, but
she, not being used to the high top, was
having trouble.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm. These are difficult to put on.	
Message	Tohka	Yo... Mm... Like this...? No, that's wrong.	
Message	Tohka	Sorry, Shido. Help me.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Hold on.	
Message	None	"(I kneeled down in front of Tohka and took her
shoes off. I tried reaching for her foot, but...
I froze.)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(Obviously, Tohka had removed her shoes, and
now I could see her toes. Seeing them wrapped
in stockings was strangely captivating.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm...? What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Ugh... S-Sorry!	
Message	Tohka	Huh...?	
Message	None	(I jumped, startled by her sudden question.)	
Message	None	"(There's no way I could tell her that I was
mesmerized by her legs. I need to calm down.)"	
Message	Tohka	Are you okay, Shido? Are you ill after all?	
Message	Shido	No, I'm fine! It's nothing!	
Message	None	"(I spat out a swift response and reached for her
foot.)"	
Message	Tohka	Mm...	
Message	None	"(When I touched her, Tohka let out a small
grunt.)"	
Message	Tohka	Mm, Shido.. Aah...	
Message	Shido	Whoa...	
Message	None	"(Tohka's legs are so smooth. I can feel her
warmth through her stockings...)"	
Message	Tohka	Mmm.	
Message	Tohka	"Sh-Shido, it's a bit strange to feel you touching
my legs..."	
Message	Shido	Hey! Don't make this weird!	
Message	Tohka	However strange it may be... I don't mind it.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	(What is she saying?!)	
Message	None	"(It almost feels like I'm doing something very
wrong.)"	
Message	None	"(I need to look away! If I don't look, it might
seem less suspicious...)"	
Message	Shido	AH?!	
Message	None	"(On the other hand, I'm kneeling right in front
of Tohka. Her knees are at my eye-level.)"	
Message	None	"(I can almost see the inside of her skirt
from between her knees. But I'm not looking!
I'm not...!)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...?	
Message	None	"(I froze, and Tohka looked down confusingly
at me. She blushed almost immediately.)"	
Message	Tohka	...!	
Message	None	(Tohka clamped down her skirt.)	
Message	Tohka	W-Were you looking, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	No! I didn't! I couldn't!	
Message	Tohka	Really?	
Message	Shido	Really!	
Message	Tohka	Really really?	
Message	Shido	Really really!	
Message	Tohka	Then I believe you...	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(Uuunh... I feel terrible. Sorry, Tohka.
I promise to wipe the memory...)"	
Message	Tohka	How do they look, Shido? Are they ravishing?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, they are. Hey, why don't you grab that
scarf you pulled earlier, too?"	
Message	Tohka	Very well! I shall. How's this, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Perfect. They pair together nicely.	
Message	Tohka	"Then, Shido, is it okay for me to ask you if
can purchase it for me?"	
Message	Shido	"Sure thing. Are you sure? You can buy clothes
if you want."	
Message	Tohka	"Clothes can only be worn every so often,
but these accessories can be worn with any
outfit, understand?"	
Message	Shido	...Got it.	
Message	Tohka	I-Is that not okay...?	
Message	Shido	"No. As long as you care for them, then I'm happy
to get them for you."	
Message	Tohka	Okay!	
Message	None	"(*sigh* That was an ordeal, but we did what
we came here to do. Except for buying clothes.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Seeing the winter section was such a treat.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I want to wear
the shoes and scarf already!"	
Message	None	"(Tohka was giddy as she exited the shop.
It was a pleasure for both of us. I'd call it
a successful date.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'm sure it'll get colder, so it's good that we
got our shopping done ahead of time."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I cannot wait! Mm...	
Message	Shido	Whoa...	
Message	None	"(Tohka was shivering. An icy gust just blew
through the air.)"	
Message	None	(I wonder if Tohka's cold.)	
Choice		Casually block the gust.	
Choice		Stay put.	
Message	None	(I stepped in front of Tohka.)	
Message	Tohka	Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I was hoping to shield you from the wind
if at all possible."	
Message	None	"(Tohka's hair blew back from the headwind.
The gust's intensity died down a bit, so maybe
my act was in vain.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, you are too kind.	
Message	Shido	Not really.	
Message	Tohka	"You don't think so? I mean, the wind slowed
down."	
Message	None	"(Tohka flashed a grin, and suddenly another gust
of strong wind blew.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Tohka	Aaah!	
Message	None	"(The wind messed up my balance, and I tipped
over.)"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	AAAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka! I can see!	
Message	Tohka	I thought you were blocking the wind!	
Message	Shido	Okay! I'll do it, so just hold down your skirt!	
Message	Tohka	Urgh... Mm...	
Message	Tohka	Aah!	
Message	Shido	Tohka! Your skirt flipped again!	
Message	Tohka	NO! I told you not to look!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry! Just hold it down!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido, you hold it down!	
Message	Shido	I can't do that!	
Message	None	"(So we embraced, fighting against the frigid
chill and her lively skirt.)"	
Message	Tohka	Mm... It is getting rather cold.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. I know, huh?	
Message	None	"(Tohka saying it made me realized that she
still wasn't dressed in winter attire, so she
no doubt would be affected by the cold.)"	
Message	None	(It would be for the best if we went indoors.)	
Message	Tohka	"If the wind picks up, I would not want to be
outside."	
Message	None	"(Just as she muttered, a sudden gust of wind
blew.)"	
Message	Tohka	AAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	BU!	
Message	None	(What I saw almost made me choke.)	
Message	None	"(Because I was a few steps behind Tohka, it
came into full view. Her skirt had lifted ever
so―)"	
Message	Tohka	"WH-WH-WH-WH-WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!
YOU FOOL!"	
Message	Shido	SSSSSSSSSSSORRY!	
Message	Tohka	Yah!	
Message	Shido	Aah!	
Message	Tohka	Whoa!	
Message	Shido	WHY?!	
Message	None	(Talk about timing!)	
Message	Tohka	"N-Not again, Shido! You had better not be
slithering behind me on purpose!"	
Message	Shido	Of course not! Just hurry up and fix your skirt!	
Message	None	"(And so, we were at the mercy of the blustery
wind.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Tohka.	
Message	None	"(The wind slowed down, giving me time to
apologize.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka was still pouty, but I couldn't blame
her. I'm sure it'd be annoying for the wind to
keep blowing up your skirt.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, you needn't apologize. I'm, um, sorry
too..."	
Message	Shido	No. You did nothing wrong. I'm the one who saw.	
Message	Tohka	That's not it.	
Message	Tohka	"You see, today... My skirt was shorter than
usual."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Really?	
Message	None	"(I had a hunch it was shorter, and it was.
Glancing up and down at her, I noticed her
legs were more visible.)"	
Message	Tohka	D-Don't ogle me!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry. I couldn't help it.	
Message	Shido	"W-Were you worried about that? Is that why
you were walking funny?"	
Message	Tohka	"I had felt as though... the smallest thing would
flip my skirt."	
Message	Shido	Isn't that to be expected with a shorter skirt?	
Message	Tohka	"I was told that, by doing so, you would be
happier..."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Tohka	"Ai, Mai, and Mii said so. That wearing a shorter
skirt would be alluring."	
Message	None	"(That's...disgraceful. Seriously... They...
Yeah, I guess I can thank them.)"	
Message	Tohka	"They also had said that miniskirts are like
magnets to the eyes of men."	
Message	Tohka	Shido, um... So were your eyes glued?	
Message	Shido	"Well, glued or not, I guess I saw under...
Sorry."	
Message	None	"(I was honest, but hoped it wouldn't embarrass
her. She could react any number of ways.)"	
Message	Tohka	"No, it's okay. It means you were looking at me,
right Shido? I can take solace in that."	
Message	Shido	You're not mad?	
Message	Tohka	"Mad? Why, of course not. I did it with the
intention of showing you. If I were mad, it
would defeat the purpose."	
Message	Tohka	But... I was a tad embarrassed.	
Message	Shido	"Understandable. I'm glad then, Tohka. Thanks
for doing all of that for me."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	None	(Tohka smiled meekly, then whispered...)	
Message	Tohka	I am glad I mustered up the courage.	
Message	None	(Tohka gripped her skirt.)	
Message	Tohka	"B-But you can't stare too much! It is still
embarrassing!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, got it.	
Message	None	"(Yeah, uh. I guess skirts are best at a moderate
length, but short skirts are nice now and then.)"
