Good luck, me.)"

Message	Miku	Hey, heeey. Hello!	
Message	Shido	Someone's here?! And she came right away!	
Message	Miku	I'm a new nurse, just passing by～	
Message	Shido	Just a passerby?!	
Message	Miku	Please call me Miku, darling.	
Message	Shido	Why are you calling me, darling?!	
Message	Miku	"You seeee, I belong to a sect that calls all patients
darling."	
Message	Shido	That has nothing to do with sects!	
Message	Miku	So what's the matter today, darling?	
Message	Shido	Can you not keep going as if nothing happened?!	
Message	Miku	"It'll be all right! Don't be afraid～ Let's take your
temperature."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Um, sure.	
Message	Miku	"...My, you seem to have a fever. It's like... 98
degrees."	
Message	Shido	That's average!	
Message	Miku	And you seem to be injured. Does it hurt～?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? How can you not tell a patient's condition?!
Are you really a nurse?!"	
Message	Miku	Why yes, of course. Although just in passing.	
Message	Shido	"I don't feel safe! And you're close! Too close for
comfort!"	
Message	Miku	"Okay, okay. No need to panic. I'll take good care of
you."	
Message	Shido	"How are you going to take care of me when you don't
know how I'm doing?"	
Message	Miku	"I will! I totally will. I mean, I'm an angel
dressed in white～"	
Message	Shido	That's impossible! Sorry, but can you try again...?!	
Message	Miku	"Hmm. Then perhaps, eating first? I'm sure you can't
eat like that."	
Message	Shido	"You're not even listening to me! But it's nice to know
you have a normal thought process."	
Message	Miku	Hold on a minute, okay～	
Message	Shido	What... What was all that about?	
Message	Shido	"She claimed to be a nurse and that everything would
be all right. I couldn't believe a word she said..."	
Message	Shido	"And first of all, how did she even show up like that?
It's too mysterious..."	
Message	Miku	"Hey, hey. Sorry for the wait, darling～ It's time for
your meal!."	
Message	Shido	"Whoa, so fast?! She came back already?! And she
brought some kind of hospital food?!"	
Message	Miku	The angel Miku is going to feed you, okay?	
Message	Shido	Hey... Close! Too close!	
Message	Miku	Here you go, darling. Open wiiiiide.	
Message	None	"*Grunt*... It smells so good... I can't endure this on
an empty stomach."	
Message	Miku	"Let's open up a lot more enthusiastically～
Now, say ahhhh..."	
Message	Shido	A-Ahh.... *nom*.	
Message	Miku	Once it's in your mouth, be sure to chew a lot.	
Message	Shido	*Nom*... *cough*...	
Message	Miku	Very good. Now let's eat more～	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Miku	Oh?	
Message	Shido	"S-So spicyyyyyyyyyy! What the hell is this?! No way
you'd be feeding this to someone who's bedridden."	
Message	Miku	"Oh, dear me... I thought that was salt. I guess I
messed up and put in chili paste... Tee-hee♪"	
Message	Shido	"How do you mess that up?! No matter how cute you
are, that's something I can't let slide."	
Message	Miku	Booo. I'm sorry～ I haven't been a nurse for long.	
Message	Shido	"That has nothing to do with you being new...
*grunt*... *cough*.. anyways, I need water..."	
Message	Miku	Here you go. I only have hot, though.	
Message	Shido	Hot! It burns. It burns. I—	
Message	Shido	—BAH! Is this some kind of torture?!	
Message	Miku	Okaaay. So after water, open wide again～	
Message	Shido	"No... Wait a minute. That's it! Yeah, I'm actually not
that hungry."	
Message	Miku	Is that so～ That's unfortunate～	
Message	None	(It's unfortunate I can't eat an actual meal...)	
Message	Shido	"During a time like this, I don't want to touch anything
if I don't know what'll happen."	
Message	Shido	Man... I'm so bored...	
Message	Shido	Oh well... I guess I have no choice but to sleep.	
Message	Shido	.....	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Oh, no...?	
Message	Shido	I see a woman... I guess I'm starting to see phantoms.	
Message	Miku	Um. Excuse me, I'm not a phantom.	
Message	Shido	Hunh...?	
Message	Shido	Wait... That's really a person....?	
Message	Miku	Yes, I am～!	
Message	Shido	When did you... Wait... Who are you?	
Message	Miku	Oh me? I'm a nurse～	
Message	Shido	"Nurse... Did someone call you over? I had no idea,
but... what a relief... When did..."	
Message	Miku	"You poor thing... Your memory must be hazy due to
your injury. I'll take good care of you, so fear not,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	I see. So that's why I didn't notice...	
Message	Shido	...Hey wait?! What are you doing?!	
Message	Miku	*Giggle*... I'm taking your pants off～	
Message	Shido	"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA?! Why?! Why would you do such
a thing?!"	
Message	Miku	"Judging from your appearance, it seems like you won't
be able to go to the bathroom by yourself. That's
why～"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but still! It's embarrassing to do this out of
nowhere!"	
Message	Miku	Okay, okay, no need to be embarrassed～	
Message	Shido	Oh! Your hand! It's coming inside the blanket!	
Message	Miku	Ei～☆	
Message	Shido	...Hahh!	
Message	Miku	Okay, don't move.	
Message	Shido	Ahh... ahh... wait, no...	
Message	Shido	That area... AH!	
Message	Miku	Okay, I'm going to go all out.	
Message	Shido	Um... Excuse me, Miss Nurse?	
Message	Miku	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Close... Your chest is... um...	
Message	Miku	How odd? Can't do it at all.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes... Um, I'm so nervous it went away....	
Message	Miku	Oh, is that so? That's unfortunate.	
Message	Miku	Let's go to the bathroom another day.	
Message	Shido	...Phew.	
Message	Miku	So, next...	
Message	Shido	...What? There's still more?	
Message	Miku	Tadaaaa. Time for your shots～	
Message	Shido	Sh-Shots?!	
Message	Miku	It'll be fine. This won't hurt a bit!	
Message	Shido	That's not even the issue... Do I need a shot?	
Message	Miku	Yes, of course. That's what I came here for.	
Message	Shido	What? Really?	
Message	Miku	Yup, yup～	
Message	Shido	Just out of curiosity, what kind of shot is it?	
Message	Miku	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Wait... Why are you going quiet? I mean, there has
to be a reason for it. What kind of shot is this for?"	
Message	Miku	Uh... I'm a new nurse.	
Message	Shido	"NO! That's something you SHOULD know as a nurse,
new OR old! The bare minimum!"	
Message	Miku	Okaaay. Now, roll up your sleeves～	
Message	Shido	She ignored me! Noooo, I'm scared! But I can't move!	
Message	Miku	First, I'm going to disinfect it!	
Message	Shido	Miss Nurse? Excuse me?! EXCUSE ME?!	
Message	Miku	Yes～?	
Message	Shido	What's not an antiseptic. That's a bath bomb!	
Message	Miku	Oh, my... *giggle*	
Message	Shido	"That's not something to giggle about! Look! It's
foaming up! LOOK!"	
Message	Miku	"It'll be fine. It'll be over before you finish counting
the stains on the ceiling."	
Message	Shido	"There aren't any! What is this, some kind of old
school love hotel?!"	
Message	Miku	And let's move onto the shot—	
Message	Shido	AHHH! I'm scared! SUPER SCARED!	
Message	Miku	My! Ooops!	
Message	Miku	I dropped the needle～	
Message	Shido	Th-That's so dangerous...	
Message	Miku	Where did you go...?	
Message	None	(Wait, she left the room.)	
Message	Miku	Mr. Shot～ Come out, come out, wherever you are～	
Message	Shido	D-Did you find it?	
Message	Miku	Mmm. No. I wonder where it went...?	
Message	Shido	...Maybe the shot got scared and ran for it, too.	
Message	Miku	Hm? Huh? Huh?	
Message	Shido	WHOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	None	"(Why is she dressed like this?! I mean, when did she
change...? That doesn't matter right now.)"	
Message	Shido	Um, I would guess that it's under the desk...	
Message	Miku	What? This way?	
Message	Shido	Not that way. A bit closer...	
Message	Miku	Whaaat? Then this～?	
Message	Shido	Yes, yes, I think it's that way...	
Message	Miku	Oh there it is! Under the desk～	
Message	Shido	"That's nice. Then please hurry up and pick it up and
stand up. Or else... your positioning. Um... it's
been, you see..."	
Message	Miku	Awww, I can't reach it～	
Message	Shido	WHAT...?!	
Message	None	"(She's squirming to try to reach for the needle, so
her hips are swaying back and forth in a suspicious
way...!)"	
Message	None	"(A-Amazing... Even her breasts are swaying back
and forth!)"	
Message	Miku	Awww, nooo. It's so deep inside. I can't... do it...	
Message	None	(Whoa... She's starting to sound...!)	
Message	Shido	Ummmmm, Miss Nurse?	
Message	Miku	Yes? What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Why don't you give up? I mean, you won't be able to
use a needle you dropped anyways. And at this rate,
um..."	
Message	Miku	Huh? My, my...	
Message	Miku	Is my outfit too revealing?	
Message	Shido	N-No! I didn't see anything!	
Message	Miku	Very well.	
Message	Miku	Then let's end our shot session.	
Message	Shido	Phew... I was saved in so many different ways...	
Message	Miku	Then, what do you want to do next?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Can't you just go home...?	
Message	Miku	No, I can't! I'm going to take care of you all day!	
Message	Shido	No, please. Just please go home!	
Message	Miku	*Giggle*... Then next, we can do bath time.	
Message	Shido	AHHH STOP! Don't take my clothes off. AAAAH!	
Message	None	(And the new nurse's care continued...)
