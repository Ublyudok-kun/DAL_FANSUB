Message	Miku	Huhhh? Where am I?! Why are you here, darling?	
Message	Shido	"Miku... Right back at you. What are you doing
here?"	
Message	Miku	"Hehe～ I don't know what's going on, but I feel
like something wonderful's happened～"	
Message	Shido	"Don't tell me you had a dream where you were at my
house and claiming to be my fiancé."	
Message	Miku	"What? How did you know, darling? Can you tell
because we've been connected by fate?"	
Message	Shido	I don't know about that... Haha...	
Message	Miku	I honestly don't mind at all being your fiancée～	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Miku	"But I'm going to go home now, okay?
Bye-bye, darling!"	
Message	Shido	"Miku... seemed unfazed. That's unexpected. Maybe
it's because she's air-headed. Or maybe it's just
her experience as an idol and being on stage..."
