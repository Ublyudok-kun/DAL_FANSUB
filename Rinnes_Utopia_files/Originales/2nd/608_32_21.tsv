Message	None	(Mm. I sure feel refreshed.)	
Message	None	(It's nice and sunny today, too.)	
Message	Kotori	Heeeeey, Onii-cha...	
Message	Kotori	Wait, huh? You're awake!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori. Morning. You're early.	
Message	Kotori	"Good morning, Onii-chan. I thought I'd
wake you up, since it's been a while."	
Message	Shido	"Too bad. More importantly, Kotori, you
seem pretty cheery this morning."	
Message	Kotori	"Because today's the day we're playing
with everyone, right?"	
Message	None	"(That's right. We're supposed to meet with
the group at the amusement park. That's
why I got up so early.)"	
Message	Shido	"You seem ready to go, Kotori. Now that I
remember, Maria's not here."	
Message	Kotori	She's already downstairs!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see. I guess she's looking forward to it
too."	
Message	None	"(Well, I'm sure she's never gone to an
amusement park before. It's natural for
her to be excited.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Onii-chan, are you possibly sad that Arusu
didn't sleep with you here? You pervert～!"	
Message	Shido	Of course not!	
Message	None	"(It's true that not seeing her here was
kind of odd...)"	
Message	Kotori	Whaaaat? Are you suuuure?	
Message	Shido	"Of course I'm sure! Forget it. Let's eat
breakfast and head out."	
Message	Kotori	Okaaaay!	
Message	Maria	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Morning, Maria. You got up early today.	
Message	Maria	"We are going on a day trip after all. The
breakfast preparations are finished, so
please feel free to eat."	
Message	Shido	Right. Thank you. I'll have some right away.	
Message	Maria	"I also prepared a bento for everyone. When
the time comes, let us eat them there."	
Message	Shido	"Ohh. So you made bento for us too. You
sure are prepared."	
Message	None	"(Her expression doesn't say as much, but
could it be... that Maria's actually excited
about today?)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Maria. You know what to expect at an
amusement park, don't you?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I have an understanding of what we will
see. However, it will be my first time visiting
one."	
Message	Shido	"Huh, figures. Then let's make the most of our
day. Today, the people going are me, Maria,
Kotori..."	
Message	Kotori	"Onii-chan, don't forget, okay～? Origami-san,
Yoshino, and Yuzuru are coming too!"	
Message	Shido	I see. So Kotori, going with white today?	
Message	Kotori	Hmmm? Whatcha talking about?	
Message	Shido	Um, never mind.	
Message	None	"(I wonder if that means she's planning to
have as much as fun as possible at the park.
Being on-call as Commander wouldn't help.)"	
Message	Shido	Everyone else should be arriving soon, right?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Let us wait outside. That way, meeting
up will not be an issue."	
Message	Shido	All right. That's a good idea.	
Message	Maria	Yes.	
Message	Shido	"Maria, once we make it to the amusement park,
do you have any rides you want to hit first?"	
Message	Maria	"I have some potential candidates, but I could
not select one. To be frank, I wish to see all of
them."	
Message	Shido	"I see. All of them... Wait, all of them?! It's a
holiday. I mean, it won't be an issue, since
we're in a game world after all."	
Message	Maria	"I understand that many people flock to
amusement parks, making them crowded.
If I do something about it, will we have fun?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, that's right. One of the charms about
attending an amusement park is waiting
in line, though."	
Message	Maria	"Very well. Then, it would be okay to set the
conditions to default, yes?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. While you're lining up, your adrenaline
hits from the waiting. It's fun to talk to your
friends in line too."	
Message	Maria	Yes. I look forward to it.	
Message	None	"(Yeah. All that matters to me is that Maria
enjoys herself to the fullest.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, good morning...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hiya! Did we keep ya waiting?"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, morning. And you too, Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino was so excited yesterday that she\ncouldn't sleep, could ya?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oogh... Um, um...	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. I'm pretty excited too. Let's all have
a wonderful time."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... I'll do my best.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah! We'll give it our all, Yoshino. Who\nknows what surprises are in store."	
Message	None	"(That sounds kinda like an evil scheme,
but oh well...)"	
Message	Shido	"By the way, are Yuzuru and Origami together?
I guess I don't see why they would be."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, Yuzuru-san is, um... still not...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yuzuru-chan, you see, was so regretful\nabout leaving Kaguya that she took too\nlong, so we left her behind."	
Message	Shido	Ahh. The usual.	
Message	Origami	Which means the only one not here is Yuzuru.	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Good morning, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Maria	"Good morning, Origami Tobiichi. Let us
get along today."	
Message	Origami	Yes, let's.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Origami. Perfect timing. Mind if we chat?	
Message	Origami	What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Ah, well... I wanted to ask a little favor.	
Message	Origami	Understood.	
Message	Shido	Huh?! You haven't even heard it yet!	
Message	Origami	"Today, you intend on prioritizing Maria
Arusu's enjoyment. You wish for me to
assist you. Am I incorrect?"	
Message	Shido	Oogh. You read me like a book...	
Message	Origami	"I am your *girlfriend*, Shido, so this insight
should not be unexpected."	
Message	None	"(She said girlfriend so emphatically. Man.
Now I feel guilty, like I'm being pressured
by her aura.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, that's how it is, so please help me out.	
Message	Origami	"Leave it to me. I know the best way to
optimize stimulation at an amusement
park. In practical terms, it will be simple."	
Message	Shido	Hearing that assures me... I think.	
Message	Origami	There's no problem.	
Message	Yuzuru	Apology. Please pardon my tardiness.	
Message	Shido	Oh. You made it, Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Regret. It was my intention to bring Kaguya
too, but she insisted it was unfair to have two
days with you when I was home yesterday."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. How very like Kaguya to be so logical.
All right, let's head in."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah～! Full steam ahead!	
Message	Maria	Yes. We are ready.	
Message	Shido	Yuzuru, a moment of your time?	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Maria... doesn't have much experience going
out with everyone like today. I was wondering
if you could make an effort to bond with her."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understanding. However your concern is
unnecessary."	
Message	Shido	Unnecessary?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmation. Without having to put forth
too much effort, I and the others will easily
make Arusu comfortable."	
Message	Shido	I... hope so.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Amusement. You are overprotective, Shido.
It's okay. Leave it to us."	
Message	Shido	If you say so. I trust you.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. How much enjoyment can one derive
from an amusement park? Kaguya and I once made
a contest of it. I was the winner. Fret not."	
Message	Shido	"When you say that, it worries me... Wait,
it's not that difficult to enjoy an amusement
park. Oh well. I'll trust your judgment, okay?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Assertion. I have an interest in befriending
Arusu too. Look, Yoshino is doing her
best as well."	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Yoshino	M-Maria-san. Let's... go together. And... chat.	
Message	Maria	Yes, Yoshino. I wish to chat as well.	
Message	Shido	"Haha. Chat as much as you'd like. We have
plenty of time. Okay, let's enter the park."
