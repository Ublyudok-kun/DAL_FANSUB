Message	Tohka	O-Oh, Shido... Welcome back.	
Message	Shido	Hey... uh, I'm home.	
Message	None	"(...It's hard to look her in the eye after what
happened earlier. I guess I'll have to do my best
to not lead the conversation that way.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, so you got back first, huh?	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah, I realized I was back here after the date.
So, um... Master?"	
Message	Shido	*Cough*! T-Tohka... Forget about that. Please!	
Message	Tohka	N-No, Shido! I just made a mistake!	
Message	Shido	"Let's forget that it happened. Both of us.
Okay...?"	
Message	Tohka	"Y-Yeah, that is probably for the best!
Let's do that."	
Message	Shido	Phew...	
Message	Tohka	But, I honestly didn't mind that about you...	
Message	Shido	What?! T-Tohka, did you say something?	
Message	Tohka	"N-No, nothing! Anyways, Shido... Maria isn't
back yet."	
Message	Shido	Maria?	
Message	None	"(According to Tohka, Maria didn't come back from
school. Come to think of it, I totally forgot that
I was looking for Maria at school.)"	
Message	Shido	"She said she wanted to look around school a
little more, but she should have just gone home
with us."	
Message	Tohka	Shido, I'll go with you to get her.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, thanks Tohka. Two heads are better than one,
right?"	
Message	Tohka	Well that, too... but I also want to be with you.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Then, shall we?	
Message	None	"(I wonder what's up? Maybe because of what just
happened, she seems more forward.)"	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, what do you think is going through Maria's
mind?"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What do you mean by that?	
Message	Shido	"I'm just wondering if I'm doing a good job at
showing Maria what she wants to see."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, what Maria wants to see... I don't know.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I guess...	
Message	Tohka	"But I don't think you've been wrong about it.
I mean, you've done well thus far. You saved me.
That's why it should be fine!"	
Message	Shido	...Thanks, Tohka.	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, where is she? Can you look over there,
Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Okay, I will!	
Message	Shido	Oh, nevermind... I found her.	
Message	Maria	So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Maria	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Shido	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Maria	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart
skips a beat, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	Tohka	"H-Hey! You can step away now! If you're too close
to Shido... Um, well, you just can't!"	
Message	Maria	Understood.	
Message	Tohka	"Okay, good response. Shido, we found Maria, so
let's go home and eat dinner."	
Message	Shido	Hey wait, Tohka! Don't pull me so hard.	
Message	Maria	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	None	"(Maria slowly walked beside me, and I took her
hand. The three of us began to walk home together.
Maria has truly become part of our family.)"	
Message	None	"(We continued to hold each others' hands as we
walked home.)"
