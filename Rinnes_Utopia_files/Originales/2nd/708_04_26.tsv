Message	Mikie	Hm. Just a little more...	
Message	Shido	Huh? That girl...	
Message	Mikie	"I-I can't reach... No, I can't give up! If reaching
doesn't work, then on my tippy-toes...!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, don't do it!	
Message	None	"(Is she taking off the poster? With that height,
there's no way she'll reach!)"	
Message	None	(Wait. Just as I thought, her balance—!)	
Message	Shido	Watch out!	
Message	Mikie	Whagyah!	
Message	Shido	Ow... Ouch. Guess that's to be expected.	
Message	Mikie	...Huh? Wha? It didn't hurt...	
Message	Shido	I get it, so it'd be great if you got off of me.	
Message	Mikie	Hyeeeek! I-I'm sorry!	
Message	None	"(In the nick of time, I prevented her from
getting hurt... by getting crushed.)"	
Message	Shido	"Good grief. You're reckless. With that stool,
there's no way you could've reached."	
Message	Mikie	"I was asked to take it down, so...
"	
Message	Mikie	Ah! No good! I'm getting called!	
Message	None	"(Perhaps her phone was in silent mode.
It was lighting up even without vibrating.)"	
Message	Mikie	"Thank you for helping me from getting
seriously injured!"	
Message	Shido	Next time, go ahead and ask for help, okay?	
Message	Mikie	Yes, I'll be careful!	
Message	None	"(I'm sure she's a good kid who tries her
hardest. But it'll help no one if she's hurt.)"	
Message	Shido	...Hm? Ah, hey! You dropped your wallet!	
Message	Mikie	H-Hawaaaah!
