Message	None	(It's morning.)	
Message	Shido	Oogh...	
Message	None	"(Feeling the burn of light on my eyelids,
I tossed in my sleep.)"	
Message	None	"(Being awake, but wanting to stay nestled in
your sheets... makes for a frustrating morning.)"	
Message	None	(Hm? What's this?)	
Message	None	"(This soft sensation. So warm and cuddly.
What could it be?)"	
Message	None	"(I'm sure it's just my pillow or blanket.
I can't let go once I've cuddled it. Well, not
true, but I held on tighter regardless.)"	
Message	Shido	Mmm...	
Message	None	"(I wonder where this warmth is coming from.
I'll never get out of bed at this rate.)"	
Message	Maria	Mm...	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	None	(...Wha?! What's going on?!)	
Message	None	"(I snapped wide awake in shock. Was Maria
sleeping next to me?!)"	
Message	None	"(I was half-asleep and ended up hugging her...
Why is Maria in my bed...?)"	
Message	Maria	Mm...	
Message	Maria	Oh...	
Message	Maria	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Good morning... Maria. Why are you here?
Didn't you sleep in your own bed last night?"	
Message	Maria	Yes, I did.	
Message	Shido	Then why are you here?!	
Message	Maria	"People who date, boyfriends and girlfriends,
are often depicted in bed together in my data.
It felt like a logical conclusion, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"How'd you come to that conclusion? Even if
we were dating, we're still just students!"	
Message	Maria	"No, that is incorrect. You have previous
experiences similar to this."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that is true. Kotori... No, that's safe.
Kaguya and Yuzuru crawled in, but they're
siblings—hm?"	
Message	Maria	Is something wrong, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Ah. Er, no. It's nothing. So, is that why you
crawled into my bed?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. That is why I excused myself to be
next to you."	
Message	Shido	Your calmness is disconcerting...	
Message	Maria	It was an extremely enchanting night.	
Message	Shido	Would you mind not saying stuff like that?!	
Message	Maria	It is a joke.	
Message	Shido	Joke or not, it's out of line!	
Message	None	"(Where in the world did she get that sense
of humor... Jeez, whose influence was that?!)"	
Message	Shido	"Please refrain from surprising me like this
in the future. It's no good for my heart."	
Message	Maria	"I understand. If that is what you wish Shido,
it is disappointing, but I will let it go."	
Message	Shido	It's disappointing, huh...	
Message	Maria	"Of course. This act is necessary in order to
build trust... in addition to teaching me about
love."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but it's kind of an ethical concern.
You shouldn't enter people's beds without
asking."	
Message	Maria	"I was not aware that any laws were being broken.
There is no issue. Even if it was illegal, there
is no judge in this world. I wouldn't allow it."	
Message	Shido	"Why are you being obtuse? It's true that
nothing illegal happened, but it's still wrong.
If someone had seen us..."	
Message	Kotori	Like how I saw? Quite thoroughly, I might add.	
Message	Shido	Gah, Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	"It's a little rude to greet your cute sister
like that, don't you think?"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I don't get the circumstances, but
you're fine, Shido. If you were always this
innocent, you'd be doing me a favor."	
Message	Shido	Hey, you look kind of upset. Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	"It's nothing at all. Come on. If you're awake,
then let's eat breakfast."	
Message	Shido	"Heads up, Kotori. It's not like I was doing
anything weird..."	
Message	Kotori	"No excuse needed. It doesn't matter as long as
you're making progress with her. But if today's
breakfast isn't up to par, your secret will slip."	
Message	Shido	Hey! Kotori-san?!	
Message	Maria	Shido. We should proceed.	
Message	Shido	Another day, another headache.	
Message	Shido	Um, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	What?	
Message	Shido	"Are you... upset? Was Hamburg steak good
enough for breakfast?"	
Message	None	"(I did the best I could with what I had, but
I can't prepare certain dishes without the
right ingredients.)"	
Message	Kotori	*sigh*...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm not upset about anything. Just thinking
about stuff."	
Message	Kotori	"Why do you ask? Is there something I should
be upset about? Did you have some kind of...
ulterior motive, or something?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No! That's not it! This morning, Maria climbed
into my bed, but it's not like we did anything!"	
Message	Kotori	"You don't have to yell it. I already know how
spineless you are, Shido."	
Message	Shido	That's pretty harsh.	
Message	Kotori	"Just speaking the truth. Either way, if Arusu's
taken a liking to you, then you might be able
to attract her."	
Message	Shido	Attracting Maria... Hm.	
Message	Kotori	"If her goal is to figure out the meaning of
love, then it'd be easiest for her to experience
it herself."	
Message	Shido	I guess.	
Message	Kotori	What's wrong? Something on your mind?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I can't really explain it, but there's
something different about Maria."	
Message	Kotori	"Different? She's a lot wiser than she used
to be, but that's only because she's been
observing us for a while now, right?"	
Message	Shido	"I mean, that makes sense, but I don't think
that's why."	
Message	None	"(She knows, but she doesn't. When I look at
Maria, that's the sense I get from her.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Huh. Well, it might be a hint. Keep that in mind
the next time you get that feeling."	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Maria	Shido. I finished cleaning up.	
Message	Shido	"Thanks. Sorry for always leaving it for you to
do."	
Message	Maria	"Is that an issue? This is the least I can do
considering I am living off of your courtesy."	
Message	Shido	But you don't have to do it all alone, you know?	
Message	Maria	"But I was taught that this was the best way
to attract a partner. She who controls the
kitchen... controls Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Who in the world told you something
as crazy as that?"	
Message	None	"(If I think about it, there's only one person
crazy enough...)"	
Message	Maria	It was Origami Tobiichi.	
Message	Shido	Figures...	
Message	Kotori	"That does sound like something that'd come
out of its mouth."	
Message	None	(Oh sister, don't call her "it"...)	
Message	Maria	"Now then Shido, please prepare yourself to
leave for school."	
Message	Shido	School? Isn't it kinda early?	
Message	Maria	"If we leave the house at the usual time,
we will be heading to school with a large
crowd as we had yesterday."	
Message	Shido	"So, in other words, you want to leave for
school as just the two of us?"	
Message	Maria	"I believe it is a good opportunity to experience
actions a couple would perform. It is early, but
if we use detours, we will arrive on time."	
Message	Shido	So, what should I do here?	
Message	Kotori	"Of course, the answer is obvious.
Go ahead."	
Message	Shido	"Wha, that was a quick response! I was
hoping you'd persuade her not to!"	
Message	Kotori	"If you went with the other Spirits, they'd
just get in the way. I think it's worth trying
to head to class with just you two."	
Message	Shido	I guess. You have a point.	
Message	Kotori	"I'll sidestep everyone else somehow.
See you later, Onii-chan."	
Message	Shido	"Urgh. If this is really happening, I should get
ready to go."	
Message	Maria	Yes. I will be waiting at the front door.	
Message	None	"(I heard a hint of cheer in Maria's voice
as I stifled a yawn.)"	
Message	None	"(If Maria's happy, then this might be for the
best.)"
