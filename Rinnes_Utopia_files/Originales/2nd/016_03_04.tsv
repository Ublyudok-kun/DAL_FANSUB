Message	None	(I'm going to go check on Kurumi.)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kurumi. I'm here to help.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Shido-san. What is the meaning of this?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well... I think this is my first time seeing
you cook, Kurumi."	
Message	Kurumi	Is that so? Then, you'll help me a little?	
Message	Shido	"Sure. It already smells delicious. What are you
making?"	
Message	Kurumi	Pot-au-feu.	
Message	Shido	"I see, a soup dish. That seems like it'll
take time."	
Message	Kurumi	"Not really. If I use a pressure cooker, it won't
take very long."	
Message	Shido	"You have a point... I didn't know you were so
knowledgeable about cooking."	
Message	Kurumi	Isn't it only natural as a girl?	
Message	Shido	"I don't know... I was really impressed hearing you
talk about it... Maybe I don't need to help, then?"	
Message	Kurumi	"No. I mean, you're here, I might as well have you
join."	
Message	Shido	What do you want me to do?	
Message	Kurumi	Hmm. Then...	
Message	Shido	Whoa... Wh-What?	
Message	Kurumi	Please don't move.	
Message	Shido	W-Wait... You're too close.	
Message	Kurumi	I'm taking time with your heartbeat, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	You don't have to use mine...!	
Message	Kurumi	"I couldn't find anything that worked. Or, do you
not want to help me?"	
Message	Shido	Well, it's not that...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	S-Stop! Don't put your fingers on my spine!	
Message	Kurumi	"My, your heartbeat seems to be a little fast now.
It's hard to get an accurate sense of time."	
Message	None	"(*Grunt*... This isn't... good. If I'm here any
longer, God knows what she's going to do to me...)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! Sorry, I forgot I had to do something!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, already? How unfortunate.	
Message	Shido	I look forward to your pot-au-feu! Later!
