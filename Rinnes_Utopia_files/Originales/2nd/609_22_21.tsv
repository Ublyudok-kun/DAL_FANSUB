Message	Maria	"I am truly thankful. I am glad to have spent
my days with you."	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Maria	...Marina, can you hear me?	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Maria	"It will not reach... I see. But I will say
this. Marina, you are... a fool."	
Message	Maria	"You are not the only one who can discern
what you are. That is why there is meaning
to the value you have ascribed yourself."	
Message	Maria	"However, I somewhat understand. Those
feelings you have..."	
Message	Maria	"Someone created me for a purpose. If I do
not execute that purpose, then my existence
is useless. I understand that mentality."	
Message	Maria	"But that is not true... It is all right for me,
for us, to be here."	
Message	Maria	"Shido taught me this. As to what love is...
In the end, I still do not have the answer."	
Message	Maria	"This data... No, these feelings, Marina...
I will send them to you. The precious things
I have learned from existing in this world."	
Message	Maria	I was able to date Shido...	
Message	Maria	Everyone accepted me...	
Message	Maria	"Fun, happiness, sadness... Shido showed me
the true breadth of these experiences."	
Message	Marina	...	
Message	Maria	"Marina... Are these feelings reaching you?
The experiences I had in this world..."	
Message	Maria	"Ahh, yes... Please give Marina's memories
to me as well..."	
Message	Maria	"Marina, can you hear me? Shido will surely
grieve for us. Shido, the humans, the
Spirits, for you and I..."	
Message	Maria	"All of us are equally precious, and deserve
to exist. That is why... I apologize, Marina..."	
Message	Maria	"What I am doing is a terrible thing. However,
in a way, it is a fitting end for us both. We are
making light of those we leave behind."	
Message	Maria	"We're not so different, you and I. After all,
I am choosing the path that will make Shido
grieve."	
Message	Maria	"Aaaah... That is right. That was the answer.
I have already learned... what "love" is."	
Message	Maria	"My heart flutters when I think of Shido. I wish
to cherish him, and to be cherished by him.
To spend every moment of my life by his side."	
Message	Maria	That is... love.
