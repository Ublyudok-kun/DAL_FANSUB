Raizen High School.)"

true.)"	
Message	None	(But not anymore...)	
Message	None	"(It seems as though I've awoken the
true me from within.)"	
Message	None	"(I may look like a normal sophomore in high
school, but it's not true. My true nature is...)"	
Message	None	(That's right―a master!)	
Message	Shido	And Tohka, my loyal servant.	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes... Master...	
Message	Shido	"Hehe. You sure look pathetic, Tohka. But it looks
really good on you."	
Message	Tohka	"D-Don't look at me so much... I-I'm getting
embarrassed."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... You must have forgotten how to speak to me,
Tohka. You do know your place, don't you?"	
Message	Tohka	...Y-Yes... My apologies, Master.	
Message	Shido	"Good girl. So do you know what I'm going
to do to you?"	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What are you going to do...?	
Message	Shido	"Hehehe. I wonder what it could be...?
Try to guess."	
Message	Tohka	...*Grunt*.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter? Tell me. Tohka, what is going
to happen to you? All dressed up and bound like
that... What is your master going to do to you?"	
Message	Tohka	...I-I can't say. It's... too embarrassing.	
Message	Shido	"My, my. Tohka, do you think that I'm going to do
something embarrassing to you? You're a bad girl."	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*... Mm... Kaaah.	
Message	Shido	What's the matter, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	...That's not fair, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hmm? What are you supposed to call me?	
Message	Tohka	M-Master...	
Message	Shido	"That's right, Tohka. All right, then let me give
you a treat and do something embarrassing,
just as you wanted."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, no... I can't...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Tohka, you don't want to?	
Message	Tohka	Oh...?!	
Message	Shido	"Then let's stop and go home today, Tohka.
Hmm, maybe I'll call Origami or someone else to
play with."	
Message	Tohka	Y-You can't do that, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"What? Then what do you want me to do?
Say it, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	"...*Grunt*. P-Please... Do whatever you want...
with me... Master..."	
Message	Shido	"Good answer, Tohka. Then let me do as you please.
I can do whatever I want to you, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"*Grunt*... Y-Yes. I... I will do... whatever
Master says..."	
Message	Shido	Hehehe. Then let's first start off with...	
Message	Shido	Start off with...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(Hm... that's troubling. Uh, what am I supposed to
do at a time like this?)"	
Choice		Give her a quiz.	
Choice		Take her to tickle hell.	
Choice		Make her smell some food.	
Message	Shido	All right, Tohka. I have a quiz for you.	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes, Master.	
Message	Shido	What's a kind of bread that you shouldn't eat?	
Message	Tohka	"*Grunt*... A-A bread that you can't eat? How
troubling... What is it?"	
Message	Shido	So, what's a bread that you can't eat, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"*Grunt*... Hmmmm... I-I don't know. I don't know
at all, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Do you give up?	
Message	Tohka	"I give up... I don't know what kind of bread there
is that you can't eat. That's terrible. It's so
unnatural."	
Message	Shido	"""I see. Then you've failed. By the way, the answer
is a ""purebred"". I must punish... those who got it
wrong."""	
Message	Tohka	What?! ...What are you doing?	
Message	Shido	Hmm. Let's see... Let's spray you with water.	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What... But that'll be cold!	
Message	Shido	Well, it is a punishment. Here we go.	
Message	Tohka	Hyaah...	
Message	Shido	"Hehehe. Second question. Who could drive all their
customers away but still make money?"	
Message	Tohka	"...Hmmmm. I-I don't know. Who could do something
like that...?"	
Message	Shido	"Failed again. The answer is a taxi driver. Another
punishment for Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Hyah...	
Message	Shido	So, third question...	
Message	Tohka	I... I don't know...	
Message	Shido	Fourth question...	
Message	Tohka	...I don't know at all.	
Message	Shido	Fifth question...	
Message	Tohka	I-I... give up.	
Message	Tohka	...*Pant, pant*.	
Message	Shido	How's that, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*... I give up.	
Message	Shido	That's 10 questions in a row you got wrong, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Hah... hyah...	
Message	Shido	You're pretty wet now.	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*... Don't come here.	
Message	Shido	Oh, look at you. You're so wet, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Ahhh?! You can't come near me, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Amazing. You're completely drenched, all the way
to a place like here..."	
Message	Tohka	N-Not there...	
Message	Shido	Ahh, look at how wet you are.	
Message	Tohka	"D-Don't look... at my back... too much. M-My
bra... will be visible..."	
Message	Shido	"Do you have time to worry about that, Tohka?
You're wet down below too, aren't you?"	
Message	Tohka	D-Down below...?!	
Message	Shido	"Your socks, Tohka. When your socks are wet, it
feels very uncomfortable, doesn't it...?"	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*... That's true, it does feel awful.	
Message	Shido	Fine. Then let's end the quiz here.	
Message	Tohka	Is... it over?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. The quiz, that is.	
Message	Tohka	Y-You're... still going to do something?	
Message	Shido	"Ah. This is only the beginning. Next, I'm going to
use this German-brand cloth that sucks water up
like crazy to wipe the water off of you."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What?! What is this interesting cloth?!	
Message	Shido	"Look at this. See how much it's sucking the water
up. I've always wanted to see how much I can
suck out."	
Message	Tohka	That's not fair, Shido! I want to do it, too!	
Message	Shido	You can't. Tohka, you can only watch.	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*... Curse you, Shido... Huh?!	
Message	Shido	Hahahaha!	
Message	None	"(And the sketchy relationship between master and
servant continued all night...)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, I'm going to tickle you like crazy. I'm
going to take this feather toy and tickle you
everywhere."	
Message	Tohka	Hi... I-If you do such a thing... it'll tickle!	
Message	Shido	Of course it will. Welcome to tickle hell.	
Message	Tohka	Haah... St-Stop, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"""Don't you mean, ""Please stop, Master""? Here.
Tickle, tickle."""	
Message	Tohka	Fwaaaaa... Aha...kuyha.	
Message	Shido	Here. Tickle, tickle.	
Message	Tohka	"Hahhaha...aha. P-Please stop... Ma—HAH!—ster...
Ahahaha..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, but I won't. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.	
Message	Tohka	Hahahaha... Mm...mmmm...mu. N-Nooo.	
Message	Shido	Here, this way... Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.	
Message	Tohka	A-Ahhhh. Not there... Aha...ahh.	
Message	Shido	Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...	
Message	Tohka	Ah...ah... ah...kufu... Hauuuun.	
Message	Shido	Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...	
Message	Tohka	...Hah...aunnn...	
Message	Shido	Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...	
Message	Tohka	Ahh, no... No... Noooo.	
Message	Shido	Here, here, here, here.	
Message	Tohka	Haaaaa...aha... Ahahaha...!	
Message	Shido	There, there, there, there.	
Message	Tohka	AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA.	
Message	Shido	Here, here, here.	
Message	Tohka	UHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.	
Message	Shido	There, there, there.	
Message	Tohka	AHAHAHAHAHAHA!	
Message	Tohka	"Hah... Hah... No, Shido... I can't...
No more, or—!"	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant*... Ah, I'm getting tired too.	
Message	Tohka	"I just can't bear to laugh anymore. I thought I
was going to die."	
Message	Shido	Hm. Good children shouldn't try this at home.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, that was a very good lesson.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Let's keep it at that.	
Message	None	(And this is how I enjoyed my time as a master.)	
Message	Shido	Hmm. I'll have you smell some food.	
Message	Tohka	What?! What are you going to do, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"Here you go, Tohka. Here's a Hamburg steak with
demi-glace, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*. That smells so good.	
Message	Shido	Right?	
Message	Tohka	Shido! I'm getting hungry!	
Message	Shido	That's right. Then I'll let you smell it, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Just the smell?! That's torture!	
Message	Shido	Hmm? Oh what? You want to eat this, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	I-I want to eat... Of course I do!	
Message	Shido	Then you know what you need to say, right Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Master! Master, give me the Hamburg steak!	
Message	Shido	Hmm... Here you go. Open up.	
Message	Tohka	Ahhh.	
Message	Shido	I'll come closer.	
Message	Tohka	Ahhh.	
Message	Shido	"Now, I'm going to make it look like you can eat
it, but... Yoink."	
Message	Tohka	HEY?! What are you doing, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"No good, Tohka. If you ask that way,
you won't get it."	
Message	Tohka	I-It's not nice to be mean, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"No, but... I'm a master. Tohka, you know who has
more power here, right?"	
Message	Tohka	P-Please...!	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Tohka	"Please Shid—I mean Master. The steak... please
give me the steak!"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... Right. Then, one more time. Here you go.
Ahh."	
Message	Tohka	A-Ahhh.	
Message	Shido	"Then I'm going to put the steak near your mouth.
Is that good? But you can't eat it until the
master says you can..."	
Message	Tohka	W-Wha... das so messed up...	
Message	Shido	If you talk with your mouth open, you'll drool.	
Message	Tohka	"Th-This isn't the time to worry about that.
Hurry... Hurry and let me eat!"	
Message	Shido	Hmm. What should I do?	
Message	Tohka	*Pant, pant*. H-Hurry!	
Message	Shido	Then I guess I'll eat it... *nom*.	
Message	Tohka	"Ah?! You ate it yourself?! What... What
torture...!"	
Message	Shido	Mmm. It's so juicy. It's just melting in my mouth.	
Message	Tohka	"Curse you, Master! It's not fair,
you get everything!"	
Message	Shido	I told you that I'd let you smell it, Tohka. Here.	
Message	Tohka	MMM! *Grunt*... That looks so good!	
Message	Shido	Right?	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt* Don't just leave it in front of my nose.	
Message	Shido	Well then, I think I will for a bit.	
Message	Tohka	Stop! Stop it! I'll go mad...!	
Message	Tohka	*Pant, pant*... *pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	Your drool. It's starting to drip.	
Message	Tohka	"*Grunt* This is painful... Please, I'll do
anything. I'll do anything, just please
give me a taste of that steak..."	
Message	Shido	No.	
Message	Tohka	"Gosh... This isn't good... My consciousness is
fading..."	
Message	Shido	That's an exaggeration...	
Message	Tohka	...*nom*...	
Message	Tohka	...*blow, blow*... *nom*...	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Tohka	...*nom*...	
Message	Tohka	...*huff*...	
Message	Tohka	...*nom*...	
Message	Tohka	...*nom*...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Shido	She's eating a steak in her imagination?!	
Message	Tohka	Mmm... *nom*.	
Message	Tohka	...Ah... *nom*.	
Message	Tohka	...Hm... *gulp*...	
Message	Shido	"An invisible steak... That sure is commitment...
What do you say, Tohka... Is it good?"	
Message	Tohka	...*nom*...	
Message	Tohka	...Hah.	
Message	Tohka	...Ah. Yes... It's delicious...	
Message	Shido	I-I see... That's great...	
Message	None	"(All right, I guess I'll let her eat in a little
while.)"	
Message	None	(And so our night continued...)
