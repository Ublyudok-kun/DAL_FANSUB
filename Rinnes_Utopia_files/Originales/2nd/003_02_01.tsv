Message	Shido	"I-If I have to pick one person... I guess I'd
choose Tohka."	
Message	Kaguya	"I don't get it, Shido. Why aren't you saying that
you want to come with me?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Questionable. Why did you choose Tohka?
I request an explanation."	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, uh... Because I made plans with her a
long time ago. I told her that we'd go to eat
some kinako bread. Right, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh! Come to think of it... You're right, Shido!
You did promise me that you'd let me try
kinako bread!"	
Message	Miku	"What?! No fair, Tohka-sannn. Darling, last time
we had to cut our afternoon tea short."	
Message	Origami	"Even if you promised, it doesn't have to be
now. It can be 10 years from now, or 20 years
from now. Shido, you should choose me."	
Message	Shido	Ngh... It's no use. This is getting out of hand.	
Message	None	"(I know! At a time like this... I'm going to have
to call the Fraxinus for help...)"	
Message	None	"(Whenever I run into issues, they always give me
some pointers or instructions. They should be
able to save me from this situation...!)"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you seem to be in trouble, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Perfect timing, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(My little sister Kotori is the Commander of the
Fraxinus. She should be a dependable advisor at
a time like this... I think.)"	
Message	Shido	Can you solve this problem for me?	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm. The girls in front of you, aside from\nOrigami, may possibly go berserk if you\nhurt them carelessly. You know that, right?"	
Message	Shido	I know that. That's why I'm struggling.	
Message	Kotori	"And you're going to choose Tohka, knowing\nthat?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it seems like I have to choose someone
now... So I thought I'd choose Tohka, since I
made plans with her before."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Well, surprisingly, it looks like you've\nthought it through for once. Then you do that.\nI'll handle the others."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Thanks.	
Message	Shido	All right, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Let's run for it.	
Message	Tohka	What?!	
Message	None	(And so, Tohka and I ran off toward town.)	
Message	Tohka	Ah, this kinako bread is quite delicious.	
Message	Shido	Really? That's great. Then eat it all, okay?	
Message	Tohka	What?! I can eat all of this?	
Message	Shido	"Of course you can. But it'll be dinnertime when we
get back, so don't overeat, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	B-But I thought you wanted some too, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Well, it wasn't exactly that. I ran
because... I guess I didn't have time?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh... Really? Th-Then... Why?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Tohka	"Um... You chose me, didn't you?
You didn't have to fulfill your promise today..."	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess so. But I just decided to do it.	
Message	Tohka	Just because you promised me?	
Message	Shido	"I told you that wasn't the case, right? I chose
you because... Well, because it was you, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	What does that mean? I don't get it...	
Message	Shido	"W-Well... I haven't been able to talk to you
much lately. And besides, it's thanks to you
that I can be here like this."	
Message	Tohka	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Up until this spring, I had a life that had
nothing to do with Spirits or girls. At least,
as far as I remember."	
Message	Shido	"But things have changed. I was able to meet a
Spirit for the first time and talk to her. That
was you, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	"Right! Back then, there was no Yoshino,
Kaguya, Yuzuru, or Miku, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Exactly. When I met you back then, you were so
different. You never listened to what we had to
say..."	
Message	Tohka	W-Well, the Mekameka guys...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I know... The AST attacked, right?
That's why you thought everyone in this world
was your enemy."	
Message	Tohka	"But you changed that view, Shido. You told me
I was no different from a human."	
Message	Shido	Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	And you taught me about kinako bread, too!	
Message	Shido	That's right, I did. It's delicious, isn't it?	
Message	Tohka	Yes! It's the best!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, you chose me because I'm the first Spirit
you ever met, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's not the only reason. I just thought
if I had to choose one person, it'd have to be
you."	
Message	Tohka	...?! I-It'd... have to be me...?!	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Tohka?!
Did you choke on the bread?"	
Message	Tohka	"N-N-N-No, it's nothing. Y-Yeah... This kinako
bread is so delicious!"	
Message	Shido	Haha, you're funny...	
Message	Tohka	I-I'm not funny, Shido! It's the kinako bread.	
Message	Shido	That's not what I meant...	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Nothing.	
Message	Tohka	Thank you, Shido. I appreciate it.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I've been meaning to have you try this
bread."	
Message	Tohka	"Th-That's not what I meant... U-Um... the fact
that you chose... Ahh..."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Tohka	"Nothing! All right, let's go back and have
supper!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're right. Let's go home.	
Message	Tohka	Okay!
