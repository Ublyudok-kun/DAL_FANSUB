Message	Shido	Mmm... Morning already.	
Message	None	"(I woke up feeling very refreshed. I still can't
believe that we're inside of a game.)"	
Message	Shido	"If I'm not careful, I'll forget the difference.
As well as why I'm in here in the first place.
That's almost a compliment for the game."	
Message	???	Zzz...	
Message	None	"(As expected of a game made by Ratatoskr.
It's almost a waste of technology.)"	
Message	None	"(On top of that, time passes here faster than
in the real world. Wouldn't that be helpful
for when I'm forced to study...?)"	
Message	Shido	"I feel like I read a manga about that recently.
It was something and the ""Room of Time,
I think."""	
Message	???	...Zzzz...	
Message	None	(Hmmm...)	
Message	Shido	"I should probably check in with the real
world now. This bed is awfully comfy,
but I think I hear someone close to me..."	
Message	None	"(Just like yesterday, I felt a very soft
sensation.)"	
Message	Shido	This sensation. Could it be...?	
Message	Shido	"Ahh, I knew it. I wonder if she crawled back
in this morning. Or if it was when we went
our separate ways last night."	
Message	None	"(Even though I asked her not to before we went
to bed...)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, she didn't agree to it herself, so it's
not her fault. Either way, I gotta wake up
Maria. I don't want another freak-out."	
Message	Shido	Hey. Wake up, Maria. I said wake up.	
Message	None	(She won't wake...)	
Message	Shido	"Maria, please wake up. It's morning.
Please, open your eyes soon.
Or else Kotori's gonna come in again."	
Message	Maria	...Zzz...	
Message	None	"(Hmm. Didn't seem to work. I'll either have
to shake her or she won't wake. Here it goes...)"	
Choice		Try shaking her awake.	
Choice		Try poking her cheek.	
Message	Shido	Hm... For now, I'll try shaking her.	
Message	Shido	Maria, wake up.	
Message	Shido	Mariaaa.	
Message	None	"(Maria sure is light and soft. Just like a
real girl.)"	
Message	Shido	...Wha?! No no no!	
Message	None	"(Damn it. Begone, evil thoughts! All I want
to do is wake up Maria!)"	
Message	Shido	Maria, please, wake up...	
Message	Maria	Mm...mmm...	
Message	None	"(I'm afraid of touching her body, so what
should I do?)"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. I wonder if poking her cheek is okay.
It's just her face, so I'm sure she'll wake up
quickly... All right."	
Message	None	"(I've made my decision. All I need to do
is follow through.)"	
Message	Shido	Here goes nothing... YAH!	
Message	Maria	Mrgh...	
Message	None	"(Oh. She reacted that time. Am I on the
right track?)"	
Message	Shido	All right. One more time. Oryah!	
Message	Maria	Please...do not...Shido...	
Message	Shido	"She's not fully awake, I guess. Is Maria
dreaming?"	
Message	None	"(Wait. Can Maria even dream in the first place?
If she can sleep, I guess it isn't beyond the
realm of possibility that she could dream.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's irrelevant. Anyways, I have to
wake her. One more time!"	
Message	Maria	Shido...you are...mean...	
Message	Shido	"That pillow talk would be terrifying if someone
were to overhear."	
Message	None	"(It's no use. No matter what I do, she shows no
sign of waking. In fact, I feel like this whole
thing turned out weirder than I wanted it to.)"	
Message	Shido	"Can't be helped. Guess I need my last resort.
I wanted to avoid it at all costs, but..."	
Message	None	"(There was only one way to do it. A technique
that was sure to wake Maria.)"	
Message	None	"(However, doing so would surely ruin Maria's
restful sleep. It might even hurt. But I can't
delay any longer. Maria, don't hate me!)"	
Message	Shido	Here I go!	
Message	None	"(Allow me to explain. This technique involves
suffocating the target, only slightly, to jolt
them awake. I'm only using blankets, though.)"	
Message	Maria	"...Mmm?
Mm, mrph, urf!"	
Message	None	(Ah, is it working?)	
Message	Maria	Ah. Whew. It seems as though I'm safe.	
Message	Shido	Morning, Maria. You slept in.	
Message	Maria	"Organizing all of that data took up time. It is
much later than when I set my alarm to go off."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'm glad you're awake. Let's go to the
living room and eat."	
Message	Maria	It is already that time, I see. Understood.	
Message	None	"(Maria looked at the clock, and seemingly
understood the situation.)"	
Message	Shido	"Listen, Maria. I need you to stop climbing
into my bed from now on."	
Message	Kotori	"Um, sorry to interrupt, but why are you two
still in bed?"	
Message	Shido	Kotori?!	
Message	Maria	Good morning, Kotori Itsuka.	
Message	Kotori	"Good morning, Arusu. And you too, Shido.
I see she crawled in again, just like
yesterday."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Seems like it.	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I have no intention of throwing a fit,
but take responsibility and watch after her,
okay?"	
Message	None	"(She shrugged and left, closing the door behind
her.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, do we not have to go?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. You don't have to ask, we're going.	
Message	None	(Somehow or another, another day has begun.)
