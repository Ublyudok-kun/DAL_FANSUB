Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido. Let's watch a movie.	
Message	Shido	Movie?	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. This one. I rented it.	
Message	None	"(I was hanging out in the living room when Kotori
brought out a movie.)"	
Message	Shido	"Cherry Blossom"? Is it a foreign movie?	
Message	Kotori	Supposedly it's the hidden gem of romance movies.	
Message	Shido	Interesting. Never heard of it.	
Message	Kotori	"I've only heard the title before, but I've never seen
it, so I don't really know the details."	
Message	Shido	But if it's a hidden gem, we might as well watch it.	
Message	Kotori	Okay!	
Message	None	"(I put in the disc as Kotori sat down on the sofa.
I sat next to her, and she wrapped her arms around
mine.)"	
Message	None	"(This is such a normal thing that couples do. I used
to be so shy about it just a little while ago.)"	
Message	Kotori	Hm...? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Nothing.	
Message	None	"(Maybe I was smiling. That was a close one. I'm sure
if I said anything, she'd get shy again.)"	
Message	Kotori	Weirdo... Oh well. Let me play it.	
Message	None	"(Kotori turned on the movie and dimmed the lights
a bit. Shortly after, the title appeared.)"	
Message	None	(And so the story began.)	
Message	Shido	Hey!	
Message	Kotori	Ah?!	
Message	None	"(I spat out the tea I had in my mouth. The movie
turned into a passionate love scene.)"	
Message	None	"(There was intense kissing, and it was hard for me to
look directly at it. I-Is this... really for all ages?!"	
Message	Kotori	This... is crazy.	
Message	None	"(Kotori hid her face with her hands as she muttered.
She seems to not be watching, but I can see she's
looking through her fingers.)"	
Message	Kotori	A-Are couples really like this...	
Message	None	(Kotori softly put her hands on mine.)	
Message	Shido	"...?! No, no, no. That's not true! This is special!
Special! So don't let it bother you."	
Message	None	"(I felt like she was asking for something and I
panicked. I wanted to think I was imagining things,
so I looked at Kotori.)"	
Message	None	"(But Kotori didn't seem to notice me watching since
she was glued to the screen.)"	
Message	Shido	Composure... Keep your composure.	
Message	Shido	Phew...	
Message	None	"(As we did that, the movie ended, and I took a deep
breath. It was love scenes after love scenes, and my
heart was pounding basically the whole time.)"	
Message	None	"(But because they loved one another, they expressed
how their separation and reunion was important. It
was certainly a very touching movie.)"	
Message	Kotori	...That was intense.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... I didn't know what to expect, but I was really
touched."	
Message	None	"(That was all I could say. I was touched but
embarrassed in a weird way. The love scenes still
ingrained in my head made my body feel hot.)"	
Message	None	"(Ahh... It's so weird. I pictured Kotori and myself
like that, and now I can't look her in the face...)"	
Message	Kotori	...Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(I almost jumped out of my seat. It's okay. It's
okay... I don't think she's caught on...)"	
Message	Shido	"All right. Now that the movie's over, why don't we go
to bed now? Yeah!"	
Message	Kotori	Sh-Shido? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I mean, it's pretty late right? Come on, Kotori.
You need to go to your room and sleep now. See you
tomorrow! Good night!"	
Message	None	"(I pushed Kotori from behind and rushed her to her
room. I jumped into my room to calm myself down.)"	
Message	Shido	Phew... Finally I've calmed down.	
Message	Shido	Gosh. That was one crazy movie.	
Message	None	"(It was a little too stimulating. Of all the people to
watch it alone with, it was Kotori...)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	*gasp*! No, no! I can't remember it!	
Message	None	"(All I could see was Kotori's face and the movie from
earlier. I tried to scrub the image from my brain.)"	
Message	Shido	"(I-I'm going to sleep! I'll sleep to get it out of my
mind.)"	
Message	None	"(That's my only choice. I rushed to my bed and dove
in. At that moment―)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido, can I come in?	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori?!	
Message	None	(My heart jumped again at having a sudden visitor.)	
Message	None	"(Calm down. I need to keep my cool. I'm not doing
anything bad. It's fine.)"	
Message	Shido	*inhale*... *exhale*	
Message	None	(I took a deep breath and got up.)	
Message	Shido	S-Sure.	
Message	None	"(I settled down enough to answer the door, and Kotori
entered slowly, hugging a pillow.)"	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	Um...	
Message	None	(She looked at me with puppy dog eyes and whispered.)	
Message	Kotori	...Can I sleep with you... tonight?	
Message	Shido	...WHAT?!	
Message	None	"(Those words were destructive, and my brain just
stopped. What is she saying...)"	
Message	Kotori	P-Please?	
Message	Shido	WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! Just wait a minute!	
Message	None	(I stopped Kotori as she was walking in.)	
Message	Shido	C-C-C-CALM DOWN, KOTORI! It's too early for us!	
Message	Shido	"I mean, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested...
But it's just too..."	
Message	Kotori	...Excuse me? What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? O-Oh... when you say sleep together... You
meant it in a normal way?"	
Message	None	"(Kotori gave me a blank stare. The next moment, her
eyes flared. I felt like I heard the fire turn on!)"	
Message	Kotori	Y-You're so dumb, you pervert! O-O-O-OF COURSE!	
Message	Shido	R-R-R-R-RIGHT! S-sorry!	
Message	Kotori	I just... wanted to sleep with you like I used to...	
Message	Shido	...I see. Then I guess that's fine.	
Message	None	(Kotori just wanted to sleep with me like old times.)	
Message	None	"(When we were kids, we used to sleep in the same
bed a lot. So I don't think it's bad. But a part of me
feels like it's wrong.)"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. If you're okay with it, it's not an issue.	
Message	Shido	It... kinda is, though...	
Message	Kotori	What? You said okay, so take responsibility!	
Message	None	(She threw the pillow at me, and it hit my face.)	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"I-I was just thinking I could keep you company from
time to time so you don't get lonely!"	
Message	None	(Did the movie affect Kotori...?)	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Then only tonight, okay?	
Message	Kotori	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	W-We're just going to sleep! Okay?!	
Message	Kotori	I-I know that!	
Message	None	(Seriously... I'm too easy on Kotori.)	
Message	None	"(Kotori changed into her pajamas and snuggled into
the bed.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Y-You'd better not do... anything weird like that
movie."	
Message	Shido	I won't. I'm turning the light off.	
Message	Kotori	Okay. Night, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Night, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(I turned the lights off and shut my eyes. Kotori said
that, but I can't get the imagery from the movie out
of my head. It took a while for me to fall asleep.)"	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	None	(What's going on...? It's hard to sleep...)	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	None	"(In my slumber, I thought I heard someone call my
name.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa... Kotori?	
Message	None	"(She treated me like a body pillow and clung onto my
body.)"	
Message	None	"(Not only were her arms wrapped around me, even her
legs and body were tight against mine.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey... I can't move like this.	
Message	None	(I guess the cause was her inability to sleep.)	
Message	Shido	Gosh...	
Message	None	"(I can't wake her up, so I guess I have no choice but
to sleep like this. Good night, Kotori.)"	
Message	Shido	...I can't sleep.	
Message	None	(Kotori was deep asleep, but I was wide awake.)	
Message	None	"(Well, obviously. Kotori was sleeping next to me. And
she's very close.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori was soft and she smelled good. It's like all
of my senses were heightened in the darkness.)"	
Message	None	"(But I won't do anything. But still this isn't good
for me.)"	
Message	Kotori	Mm... Zzz...	
Message	Shido	Gosh, she totally has her guard down.	
Message	None	"(Kotori is sleeping peacefully. She doesn't seem like
she'll wake up easily.)"	
Choice		I'll stay still so she won't wake up	
Choice		I-I can touch her a little right?	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess I have to endure it until morning.	
Message	None	"(I gave up on falling asleep and decided to watch
Kotori sleep. I can at least do this much, right?)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	None	"(Is she talking in her sleep? She called my name
again. Just then, tears streamed down her face.)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido. Don't go anywhere...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(Is she having a dream that I'm going to leave? That's
not good.)"	
Message	Kotori	No, Shido...	
Message	None	"(Kotori's grip tightened. Maybe she's was holding
tightly so I wouldn't go anywhere.)"	
Message	Shido	Don't worry. I'll always be by your side, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(I whispered into her ear and wiped away her tears.
And then I patted her head.)"	
Message	Shido	"I will never leave you behind. We'll always be
together, Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe.	
Message	Kotori	Shido... I love you...	
Message	None	"(Kotori's expression softened. I made a promise to
myself.)"	
Message	Shido	I will protect you forever.	
Message	Kotori	...Okay.	
Message	None	(As if she heard, Kotori nodded.)	
Message	None	"(Is she awake or not...? Well, it doesn't matter. It's
not like I'd be troubled if she heard it.)"	
Message	Shido	I love you, Kotori.	
Message	None	(In the dark room, I softly kissed Kotori's cheek.)	
Message	None	"(Look how defenseless she looks. It's hard for me to
hold back, you know.)"	
Message	Shido	"I-I can touch her a little and she won't wake up,
right?"	
Message	Shido	Kotori? Kotori-saaaan?	
Message	Kotori	Mmm...	
Message	None	(She wouldn't wake up, nor did her breathing change.)	
Message	None	(All right... She won't wake up!)	
Message	None	"(I made a fist happily. I slowly reached for Kotori's
body.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori's pajamas exposed just the right amount. Her
pale skin showed a little... So poisonous to the eyes."	
Message	None	(I'm just adjusting her clothes... That's all.)	
Message	Kotori	Mmm...	
Message	Shido	―?!	
Message	None	"(Right before I touched her, a sharp pain went through
my neck.)"	
Message	Shido	Ow... Gah...!	
Message	None	(She elbowed me... I can barely talk...)	
Message	Kotori	Hmph... I will give.. my godly hands...	
Message	None	"(She was choking me with such intensity and accuracy.
I-Is she awake?!)"	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...! I give up!	
Message	Kotori	MMMMM....	
Message	Shido	AGAAHAHAHA....	
Message	None	Sh-She's choking me. A... My consciousness―	
Message	None	(―My memory ended there.)	
Message	Kotori	It's morning. Shido, wake up.	
Message	Shido	Mm...	
Message	None	(She shook my body, and I was slowly coming to.)	
Message	Shido	Mmm... *yawn*... Morning, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Did you wake up before me?	
Message	Kotori	Kinda.	
Message	None	"(Kotori had changed into her uniform. She seemed to
have gone back to her room while I was sleeping.)"	
Message	Kotori	Th-Thanks for last night. Sorry for being so pushy.	
Message	None	"(She adjusted her hair and blushed as she thanked me.
I smiled.)"	
Message	Shido	Were you relieved to see me in my room?	
Message	Kotori	Huh?	
Message	None	"(Kotori's eyes grew wide as if I hit the nail on the
head.)"	
Message	Kotori	H-How did you know?!	
Message	Shido	Because I felt relieved that you came to wake me up.	
Message	None	"(Morning came and Kotori wakes me up. Like any other
day.)"	
Message	None	"(So much happens every day, but I feel like the day
has to start like this.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'm always prepared to be woken up by you. Don't
worry. You can come to wake me up every morning."	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	None	(Kotori smiled happily and put her hand on her chest.)	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, but you should at least try to wake up on your
own sometimes."	
Message	Shido	"That I can't promise. If I wake up on my own, I think
you'll cry from the loneliness."	
Message	Kotori	What?! I-I wouldn't cry over that!	
Message	Shido	"Really? You looked like you were about to cry and
say, "You didn't wait for me!""	
Message	Kotori	"Sh-Shut up! Just hurry up and wake up! It's almost
breakfast time!"	
Message	None	"(She rushed me out of the room. Kotori whispered as
she pushed against my back.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, I just want you to shut up and listen to me.
If you do that, I'll always take care of you."	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay. I got it, Princess.	
Message	Kotori	What! Y-You're making fun of me!	
Message	Shido	No, I'm not.	
Message	None	(I turned around and looked at Kotori.)	
Message	Shido	You're always going to be with me, right? Thanks.	
Message	Kotori	Oh...	
Message	None	(Kotori's eyes grew wide, and immediately she smiled.)	
Message	Kotori	Of course!	
Message	None	"(I ingrained her bright, sun-like smile into my
memory.)"
