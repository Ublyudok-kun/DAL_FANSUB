Message	Shido	...Huh? What was I doing again?	
Message	Shido	...It's quiet. Are we in the middle of class?	
Message	Shido	"...It's hard to walk. I feel a dull pain... Wait,
I seem to have grazed my knee."	
Message	Shido	"I remember now! I tripped during P.E., so I'm on
my way to the infirmary. Uh, it's... this way."	
Message	Tamae	What's the matter, Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Oh Tama-ch... I mean... Okamine-sensei.	
Message	Tamae	I thought you were... in the middle of P.E. class.	
Message	Shido	Oh, I am. But I tripped.	
Message	Tamae	"What?! Listen to me, Itsuka-kun. Calm down.
First, let's check if you're conscious..."	
Message	Shido	"We're going to start from there?! I think you're
the one who needs to calm down! It's obvious
that I'm conscious."	
Message	Tamae	"I-It's my first time doing CPR, but... I promise,
um... I'll be gentle."	
Message	None	"(She's breathing really heavily. Is that what
she's gearing up for?!)"	
Message	Tamae	Now then. Just relax, Itsuka-kun.	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh, you're breathing out carbon dioxide, so I
don't need that. Sensei, please don't come any
closer."	
Message	Tamae	No, this is very important.	
Message	Shido	Look, I just skinned my knee. See?	
Message	Tamae	Oh, is that so? That's... unfortunate.	
Message	Shido	Are you serious?!	
Message	Tamae	"No wonder you're here. I thought you had turned
into a delinquent..."	
Message	Shido	"No, no... It's not like that, don't worry.
Anyways, I'll be going now, okay?"	
Message	None	(Phew... That was a close one.)	
Message	Tamae	Oh... Itsuka-kun. Hold on just a moment.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Y-Yes? Did you have something you wanted to
say?"	
Message	Tamae	Do you know Tobiichi-san in our class?	
Message	Shido	Tobiichi... You mean Origami Tobiichi?	
Message	Tamae	Yes. I'm glad you remember her name.	
Message	Shido	"Well, she sits next to me... And we've been
through some stuff together, kind of."	
Message	Tamae	"Oh, is that so? She hasn't been to class in a
while now..."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Sh-She hasn't?	
Message	Tamae	"She's been coming to school, but going straight to
the infirmary. The seat next to you is always open
these days, you know."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wait? Really?	
Message	Tamae	"Reaaally. Tobiichi-san hasn't come to class since
spring. Itsuka-kun, where did you see her last?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Is that so? Um... come to think of it,
maybe..."	
Message	None	(Something feels off... I wonder what it is.)	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(Maybe I'm imagining things. Tama-chan was the
one who brought it up, though.)"	
Message	Tamae	"Tobiichi-san... She seems to not fit in with the
classroom. She's very quiet."	
Message	Shido	Quiet? Well, I guess she is...	
Message	Tamae	"I've been checking in on her from time to time.
If she's in the infirmary today, please send her
my regards."	
Message	Shido	U-Um... I will.	
Message	Tamae	Thank you.	
Message	None	(Origami... Tobiichi.)	
Message	None	"(I feel like I've heard her name before. I kind of
remember what she looks like...)"	
Message	Shido	"... Huh? Wait, I guess I can't remember her. Maybe
I just imagined it."	
Message	None	(Well, whatever. I'll head over to the infirmary.)	
Message	Shido	Excuse me.	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	None	(No one's here. What do I do?)	
Message	None	"(Well, I'm sure no one will mind if I used some
alcohol and a bandage.)"	
Message	Shido	Excuse me...	
Message	Origami	Oh?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	None	(A... girl?)	
Message	None	"(I didn't notice because of the curtain. She
seemed to be frozen in shock. But she's in
uniform, so she's obviously a student here...)"	
Message	Origami	Hahh...	
Message	None	"(Man, she's really pretty. Wait... is she the
Tobiichi-san who always goes to the infirmary?)"	
Message	None	"(Hmmm. She seems familiar. I even feel like I've
spoken to her before.)"	
Message	None	"(Tama-chan did ask me to talk to her, so I guess
I'll approach her.)"	
Choice		Is the teacher not here?	
Choice		Sorry for the wait.	
Choice		D-Don't move. Put your hands up!	
Message	Shido	"U-Um... is the teacher not in today? I tripped
during P.E."	
Message	Origami	U-Um... Um... Ahh?! I-I'm so sorry.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	(The girl blushed and ran away.)	
Message	None	(The air is tense. Maybe I should...)	
Message	Shido	"Hey, sorry for the wait. Is there an opening on
the bed?"	
Message	Origami	Huh...?! Ahh... I-I...	
Message	None	"(Wait, did she think I was serious? She's frozen
stiff.)"	
Message	Origami	...Sh...	
Message	Shido	"Whoa... Um, sorry, that was a joke. A very
innocent joke."	
Message	Origami	...I'm going to go take a shower.	
Message	Shido	Okay, sure. Wait, huh? What?!	
Message	None	(She's going along with it?!)	
Message	None	"(She's good at going along with things... But she
seemed serious.)"	
Message	Shido	"D-Don't move. Put your hands up! There's an
injured person here! Stay calm, and I won't pour
soy sauce into your curry!"	
Message	None	(...Hey! What the hell am I saying?!)	
Message	Origami	H-Huh...?!	
Message	None	(She's still frozen.)	
Message	None	(M-Maybe I can treat myself now...)	
Message	None	(A-All right. I'm good now.)	
Message	Origami	U-Um...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	H-How long should I stay put like this?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, sorry. I-I'm good now.	
Message	None	"(She was still this whole time?
What a weird girl.)"	
Message	Origami	I... I can move now?	
Message	Shido	Um, are you...	
Message	Origami	...Ah.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Hey!	
Message	Origami	S-Sorry...!	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	(I-I can see it...)	
Message	None	"(No, no... Now isn't the time for that. Calm down,
Shido.)"	
Message	Origami	Mmm...	
Message	Shido	A-Are you okay...?	
Message	Origami	No... Don't come near me.	
Message	Shido	Please don't phrase it like that. It sounds wrong.	
Message	Origami	If you come too close... I'll... get embarrassed.	
Message	None	"(I see... so she's just shy. The teacher did say
she was quiet.)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, just calm down. I won't do anything. You
can get up on your own, right?"	
Message	Origami	I just slipped... No problem.	
Message	Shido	"I see. I'm glad. Then can you hurry up?
Or else, um..."	
Message	Origami	Um, what?	
Message	Shido	"Well the way you're positioned... I guess I'm
embarrassed to be facing you."	
Message	Origami	Oh...	
Message	Origami	Did you see it...?	
Message	Shido	Ye... I mean no. I didn't see it!	
Message	Origami	Really?	
Message	Shido	"R-Really. So please get up. Uh, O-Origami
Tobiichi-san... right?"	
Message	Origami	There was a name tag inside my skirt.	
Message	Shido	There was?! I don't remember seeing any letters...	
Message	Origami	So you did see it.	
Message	Shido	Oh... *grunt*... Crap...!	
Message	Origami	Pervert...	
Message	Shido	"*Grunt*... S-Sorry! I'm going to close my eyes, so
please get up! I can't help but stare if you're
like that."	
Message	Origami	...It's fine. No need to close your eyes anymore.	
Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... I'm glad. I'm going to open my eyes,
then."	
Message	Shido	Um... Are you hurt at all?	
Message	Origami	I-It's nothing...	
Message	Shido	"I see. I'm glad. Uh, my name is Shido Itsuka. Nice
to meet you, Tobiichi-san."	
Message	Origami	...I know. I've always... been watching you.	
Message	Shido	"I see. So you already know me, huh? Wait...
What do you mean you've always been watching
me? You're always in the infirmary, right?"	
Message	Origami	"I've seen you from far away with binoculars.
I remember you."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see... Th-Thanks... I guess?	
Message	None	(...She's a weird one.)	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	(I wonder what this awkward silence is.)	
Message	Origami	Squirm...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What did you just say?	
Message	Origami	It's my way of expressing that I'm blushing.	
Message	Shido	Don't say it!	
Message	None	(She's not just shy. She's really weird.)	
Message	Origami	U-Um...	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. What's the matter?	
Message	Origami	Are you... okay? Your injury, I mean.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, yeah, this isn't a big deal. I could just lick
it and it'd get better."	
Message	Origami	A-Are you going to... tell me to lick it...?	
Message	Shido	Huh?! No, no! That was just a saying.	
Message	Origami	A saying?	
Message	Shido	"Um... I wanted to say it's not a big deal. See?
All I need is a bandage and I'll be good."	
Message	Origami	I see... I'm so glad.	
Message	Shido	Thanks for your concern.	
Message	Origami	...Hey, Itsuka-kun? How do you know me?	
Message	Shido	Huh? I... don't know.	
Message	Origami	You knew my name...	
Message	Shido	Oh, your name? The teacher told me.	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	None	"(And thus, our conversation ended. This is so
awkward.)"	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Origami	"...S-So did you crumb for me because of the
tr-reacher?"	
Message	Shido	You seem to be stumbling, but I don't know why.	
Message	Origami	"S-Sorry. I don't talk to people much... I get so
nervous, I can't speak properly."	
Message	Shido	You don't like to talk to people?	
Message	Origami	"Yeah... It's very embarrassing.
Especially with you..."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Sorry, I couldn't hear you just now.	
Message	Origami	No, it's not a big deal. Nevermind.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Well, hang in there just a bit longer.
And on a side note, it's not because the
teacher told me to. I just got hurt during P.E."	
Message	Origami	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. So I'm not here to pull you out or anything.
I've stayed here long enough... Anyways, I'm going
to go now."	
Message	Origami	O-Okay.	
Message	Shido	"Well... I do feel sad that you're not
coming to class."	
Message	Origami	Sad...? Why...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I like spending time in the classroom. If we
were in class together, I'm sure it'd be fun. Sad
isn't the right word... It's unfortunate."	
Message	Origami	"I... I'm not good at talking to people...
so I can't."	
Message	Shido	But you're talking to me now.	
Message	Origami	Mm... but...	
Message	Shido	I'm sure you can do it. Everyone in class is nice.	
Message	Origami	"But I'm very embarrassed right now... My heart is
about to explode. If this is going to happen every
day, I wouldn't be able to stand it."	
Message	Shido	"Then, how about this? I'll visit the infirmary
from time to time. Then maybe you'll get
used to it eventually, no?"	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Nothing will change if you stay here alone.	
Message	Origami	Maybe just a little... from time to time.	
Message	Shido	"I see. That's good. Later. I'll come visit
you soon."	
Message	Origami	Okay... later...	
Message	None	(Origami Tobiichi-san, huh?)	
Message	Shido	It would be fun to spend some time with her.
