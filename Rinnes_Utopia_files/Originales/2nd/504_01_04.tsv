way... I'm going to see who it is.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, you.	
Message	Kannazuki	Hm? What do you want?	
Message	Shido	"Can you not get in the way? Kurumin is actually
having a really great time with me right now."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Right back at you. Don't get in my way.
Kurumin-chan is my potential queen."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What exactly are you expecting out of a maid?	
Message	Kannazuki	"None of your business. You still seem to be a
student. But can a young man like you even be
out here past your bedtime?"	
Message	Shido	"R-Right back at you. You're like a middle-aged
man, at a maid café at this hour... Aren't you
embarrassed?"	
Message	Kannazuki	Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yeah! I'm embarrassed! But that's the beauty of
it! Embarrassment is the path to ecstasy. That
kind of corruption is the highway to the climax!"	
Message	Shido	Th-This guy... is not good...	
Message	Kannazuki	"Now, get out of my way. This isn't for a young'un
like you. Kurumin-chan is about to spend some
adult time with me."	
Message	Shido	"Wait. I can't afford to have Kurumin spend time
with a suspicious guy like you."	
Message	Kannazuki	What?! Get out of my way.	
Message	Shido	Never...	
Message	Kannazuki	Grrr, let go!	
Message	Shido	No! You bastard...

Message	Shido	OHHHH!	
Message	Shido	Th-That was...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Her white skin stands out against the
black cloth..."	
Message	Shido	...The black is standing out against the white!	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, no, no, you two don't fight over Kurumin ☆
That makes me unhappy ♪ Any master who causes a
ruckus at the café will be sent home, you know?"	
Message	Shido	We're not arguing!	
Message	Kannazuki	We were just getting to know each other!	
Message	Kannazuki & Shido	We're BFFs!

what this Forbidden Ultimate Trick is.)"	
Message	None	"(So, why am I always sitting in the seat at the
back? Because the ultimate secret is here. Hehe.
That is...)"	
Message	None	(This seat is near the floor vent.)	
Message	None	"(The air system is for the customer and maids to
keep their feet from getting too cold. I've had
my eye on this heater since I first came here...)"	
Message	None	"(Furthermore, if it's this specific seat, I can
reach out anytime to the switch and adjust
the air flow!)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-saaaan. Sorry for the wait!	
Message	None	"(She's coming! Now's my chance! I'm going to crank
the wind power to the max!)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-saaan, let's continue feeding you～	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...

Message	Kurumi	Gosssh... I'm so sorry, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"N-No, it's fine. Ugh, that stupid vent. A-Anyways,
are you okay, Kurumin? Haha."	
Message	Kurumi	"Awww, I'm so embarrassed that you saw that.
Kurumin is sooo hakyuuuun. But now that you
showed your concern, I'm all better."	
Message	None	"(Hehehe... Honestly I do feel a little bad, and
it's making my heart hurt... There's still a sense
of achievement inside of me. I... won.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Anyways, Shido-san. Let's move on. Open wiiide.	
Message	Shido	Ahh... Hehehe.	
Message	None	"(Despite the powerful enemy Corruption☆Slave
Parfait... In a sense, I lost the battle in terms
of investment. But I won the war.)"	
Message	None	"(I was able to uncover Kurumin's secret black
flower garden!)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Okay, Shido-san. One more bite. Kurumin's parfait,
Moe-Moe☆Dokyun."

satisfied. SO satisfied!)"	
Message	Clerk	Your total is 3,000 yen.	
Message	Clerk	Have a nice day, Master!

Message	Shido	"...If you think about it, that was totally sexual
harassment..."
