Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	Shido	...Hmmmm.	
Message	Shido	What... was I supposed to do today?	
Message	Shido	I have a feeling I had plans.	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan, are you here?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kotori? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	"""Don't ""what's the matter"" me! Aren't you going to
Kurumi-chan's house today?"""	
Message	Shido	Huh? Why would I go to Kurumi's house?	
Message	Kotori	"Because Kurumi's family's going on a trip, and
she's house-sitting, remember? Remember
you were asked to check in on her yesterday?"	
Message	Shido	What...?! Oh... Come to think of it, yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"I'm going to go sleep over at my friend's house,
so why don't you spend the night at Kurumi-chan's?"	
Message	Shido	U-Uh, that's not okay!	
Message	Kotori	Who cares? You're childhood friends!	
Message	Shido	"Childhood friends...? R-right... Kurumi and I are
childhood friends. But it's not okay to spend the
night. We're no longer kids."	
Message	Kotori	Hahah. Later, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	"...I see... So I was about to go visit my
childhood friend, Kurumi."	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi... I wonder if she's doing okay. I guess
I'll go check in on her."	
Message	None	(So... I'm here at Kurumi's place, but...)	
Message	Shido	What... is this situation...?	
Message	Kurumi	Huh? Oh, Shido-san. Welcome.	
Message	Shido	"""Don't ""welcome"" me! You didn't answer the door no
matter how much I rang the bell!"""	
Message	Kurumi	"Because I was too lazy to get the door. Oh, go
ahead and sit wherever you want."	
Message	Shido	"Damn it. There's so much I need to tell you, but I
can't even keep up... Anyways, there's no place
for me to sit."	
Message	Kurumi	"That's not true. You can sit in the spot
next to me."	
Message	Shido	"There's not enough space there... I mean, that's
only wide enough for one person... This room is
a real sty, you know that?"	
Message	Kurumi	"It's usually a bit better. But since my parents
are on a trip..."	
Message	Shido	...Is it a world trip or something?	
Message	Kurumi	No, just four days, three nights at Atami.	
Message	Shido	"Basically... in just a few days, you've created
this nightmare nest..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Anyways, Shido-san. Perfect timing. Can you
help me take off Efreet's Horn? It's too
inefficient for me to do alone..."	
Message	Shido	"I'm not here to play games! Your mom asked me to
check in on you! Jeez... Stop playing around and
let's clean up."	
Message	Kurumi	Whaaaaat.... I'm so lazy...	
Message	Shido	"Don't be lazy. At least clean the stuff you ate!
Jeez, your whole room smells like pan-fried
noodles. Hard to believe this is a girl's room..."	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh, you're such a nag, friend-o.	
Message	Shido	"Of course I would be. Having a friend
as lazy as you."	
Message	Kurumi	"Fine, fine, just let me get to a save point first,
then I can help you."	
Message	Shido	"This is YOUR room! Jeez... and what's up with the
way you look?"	
Message	Kurumi	What about it?	
Message	Shido	Um, change. You look like a homeless person.	
Message	Kurumi	"Who cares? I'm in my room. No one's going to visit
anyways."	
Message	Shido	H-How about me?	
Message	Kurumi	"Awww, man... Shido-san, you distracted
me and I died."	
Message	Shido	Pause the game, then...	
Message	None	"(She's a lost cause... Jeez. I guess I'll just
clean on my own, then.)"	
Message	Shido	...I'm just going to start cleaning.	
Message	Kurumi	Go on ahead...	
Message	Shido	Jeez...	
Message	None	"(I'll start off by throwing away everything
I can...)"	
Message	Shido	"...This place is filled with bags from the
convenience store. Have you been eating
food from there this whole time?"	
Message	Kurumi	Yeah, so? Oh, last night I had hamburgers.	
Message	Shido	"...I'll cook tonight, then. It's not good for your
health to eat cup noodles and snacks every day."	
Message	Kurumi	There's nothing in the fridge, though.	
Message	Shido	I'll go buy something.	
Message	Kurumi	"Then can you also buy me some juice, ice cream,
and some more snacks?"	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, and some manga, games, and some kind of anime.
Dealer's choice."	
Message	Shido	"Where the hell do you think I'm going shopping?!
I'm going to the market down the street!"	
Message	Kurumi	"...Gosh, fine. I guess I can just order them
online."	
Message	Shido	"...What is up with this room? It's just one trash
heap after another..."	
Message	Kurumi	Awww, I lost againnn.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kurumi. Can I throw this paper bag away?	
Message	Kurumi	Just throw away whatever.	
Message	Shido	And why is your face wash on the floor here?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, there's still some left.	
Message	Shido	"Are you washing your face in here? I bet you
anything you're holding onto things you're not
using anymore. Your room will always be messy."	
Message	Kurumi	"It's fine! I'm going to use it later,
so just leave it."	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, when exactly is later for you... Damn it,
there's so much stuff coming out from under
your bed..."	
Message	None	"(There are so many used cosmetics. You're not a
dog or a crow, so don't hide things under your
bed...)"	
Message	None	"(There's also a dusty pencil case. She's... going
to school, right...?)"	
Message	None	"(*Grunt*... I just grabbed something soft... It's
her underwear! God, I hope she washed it...)"	
Message	None	(There's more stuff in the back...)	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's this...?	
Message	None	"(There's a box with books inside, as if she was
hiding them.)"	
Message	None	"(Books... under the bed... No. No way.
She is a girl.)"	
Message	None	(What do I do? Should I just put it back?)	
Choice		Take a sneak peek.	
Choice		Ask Kurumi what's inside.	
Message	None	(I'm so curious. I'm going to check it out.)	
Message	None	(Kurumi is...)	
Message	Kurumi	ARGH! God, the weaklings are so annoying. Ugh.	
Message	None	"(She's so focused on the game, she's not paying
attention to me. Now's my chance.)"	
Message	None	(Hm...? This is...?)	
Message	None	(...An album.)	
Message	None	(There are old photos. Even photos with me.)	
Message	None	(Kurumi... She was adorable back then.)	
Message	None	(Well, even now she's not bad visually, but...)	
Message	Shido	Hmm... I wonder why she ended up like this.	
Message	Kurumi	"...Shido-san. What are you mumbling about? It's
creepy that you're doing that in a young maiden's
room."	
Message	Shido	"What maiden are you referring to?!
Wear some clothes!"	
Message	None	"(No. I guess we're not at that point in our
relationship where she gets shy over stuff.
I'm going to ask her what's inside.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kurumi? What's inside this box I found under
the bed?"	
Message	Kurumi	What? Under the bed... *gasp*!	
Message	Kurumi	Sh-Shido-san... you can't look at that.	
Message	Shido	"What... don't tell me... you're hiding
inappropriate books in here..."	
Message	Kurumi	N...No. I-It's my album.	
Message	Shido	Album? As in photo album?	
Message	Kurumi	"Y-Yes... They're photos of me and you. Of our
childhood."	
Message	Shido	Who cares. Why are you all shaken up about it?	
Message	Kurumi	You can't! ...Um, it's embarrassing, you know?	
Message	Shido	Embarrassing...? Why?	
Message	Kurumi	J-Just because...!	
Message	Shido	"You're so weird. Oh, well... If it's not trash,
then I'll leave it be."	
Message	Shido	"Ahh. Really, this room isn't getting clean at all!
I'm going to stop here and prepare some food
to eat."	
Message	Kurumi	Fenkyu～	
Message	Shido	"Don't talk with your mouth full! And why are you
snacking when I'm telling you I'm about to cook?!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Irmean, who fares...*gulp*. When you're done
cooking it, bring it up here, would ya?"	
Message	Shido	You have no intention of moving...	
Message	Kurumi	I'm busy right now.	
Message	Shido	...Hey, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	What is it?	
Message	Shido	...You're taking baths at least, right?	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh. How rude, Shido-san. I am a girl, you know.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry about that.	
Message	Kurumi	I took a bath, like... 70 hours ago.	
Message	Shido	"WHAT?! That's almost three days! The general
public considers that not bathing!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Three days isn't a big deal. I mean, it's not like
I sweat much. Do you want to smell me?"	
Message	Shido	HELL NO!	
Message	Kurumi	I thought you wanted to!	
Message	Shido	"Who do you think I am? Do I look like a dog that
sniffs out drugs?"	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh, what a nag! I thought you were my friend.	
Message	Shido	"Is your image of a friend someone who'd smell his
other friend who's in her underwear?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Come on, Shido-san, you're being so nitpicky about
everything."	
Message	Shido	I'm not. You're too messy.	
Message	Kurumi	Whaaaat?	
Message	Shido	"Just shut up and go take a bath while I cook.
Got it?"	
Message	Kurumi	I'm lazy～	
Message	Shido	Don't be lazy about bathing...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Bathe with me～	
Message	Shido	Do I look like your caregiver?	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh? You don't want to bathe with me? You used to
before..."	
Message	Shido	"Um. Considering our age, we shouldn't be bathing
together."	
Message	Kurumi	But I don't want to unless you go in with me～	
Message	Shido	What are you, a child?!	
Message	Kurumi	Boooo!	
Message	Shido	...O-Okay, fine. You want me to go in with you?	
Message	Kurumi	M-hm. Now... take me to the bathroom.	
Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... Jeez. What am I going to do with you,
Kurumi..."	
Message	None	(...And so I took care of Kurumi all day...)	
Message	None	(She is so much work...)	
Message	None	"(And what happened in the bath... Yeah, I'm going
to keep that to myself.)"
