Message	None	(And so I left the house with Maria...)	
Message	Shido	"This really seems too early. I don't see a
single student walking to class."	
Message	Maria	Hee hee.	
Message	Shido	Maria, you seem like you're having fun.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It is not much of anything, but it feels
quite nice. The morning air, the birds chirping,
people walking by. I feel... strangely excited."	
Message	Shido	I see. I think I know what you mean.	
Message	None	"(Morning walks with a cool breeze are so
nice, after all.)"	
Message	Shido	"If we go this way, we'll make it to school in
no time. It's still early. Wanna take a detour
or something? "	
Message	Maria	Yes. Please show the way, Shido.	
Message	None	"(We headed down a different road from
the one we usually took to school.)"	
Message	Maria	Please look, Shido. There is a cat.	
Message	None	"(Maria was staring at a cat, curled into a ball
and loafing upon the fence.)"	
Message	Shido	Yep, that's a cat. Must be someone's pet.	
Message	Maria	"If I'm not mistaken, there's another one
right there?"	
Message	Shido	Hmm. Ah, you're right. There it is.	
Message	Maria	"Please look up, Shido. It seems to be
looking at a bird."	
Message	Shido	"I wonder if it's on alert. Well, that's not
too unusual."	
Message	Maria	"Is that so? For me however, every view is
new and exciting."	
Message	Shido	Really? Then I'm glad we left early.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. This has been a sublime experience.
Had we walked with a group, I wouldn't have
the chance to take in all of my surroundings."	
Message	None	"(Maria has a childlike sense of wonder as she
admires the sights around her. It's kind of
charming. I'm having fun just watching her.)"	
Message	Maria	...Shido? Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	No, you just seem to be enjoying yourself.	
Message	Maria	Is that strange?	
Message	Shido	"It's not strange. Not strange at all. When I'm
with you, Maria, I also discover new things,
and it's fun to see."	
Message	Maria	Is that true...?	
Message	Shido	"Totally. Walking to class is an everyday thing
for me, but I don't mind it when I'm with you."	
Message	Maria	I see. So this is a typical occurrence for you.	
Message	Shido	"Yep, but that's why I said that being with
you gives me the opportunity to see it from
a new perspective."	
Message	Maria	"It is true that, when walking on my own, I
could feel something transcending mere
observation. It is all thanks to you, Shido."	
Message	Maria	"When you are near, you teach me things I
could never imagine. Even if I knew about them,
through your eyes, I understand them better."	
Message	Shido	"This is... just a guess. There's a lot of things
you know, Maria, but maybe, there isn't a lot
you know about yourself, huh?"	
Message	Maria	About... myself?	
Message	Shido	"Your smile is wonderful. You know how to
be happy and carefree. But even though you
can, you didn't until now. Maybe that's why?"	
Message	Maria	That is one way of looking at things.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it's weird. All it takes is a new frame
of mind, or a friend to show you the way,
to see a whole new world."	
Message	Maria	A whole... new world?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's right. We can change the world.
If you need a new start, just do it. It's not a
new world you're noticing. It's a new you."	
Message	Maria	"What a poetic expression. I don't understand
it fully."	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to understand it right away.
But you'll get it eventually, Maria.
Um, let's see. Are you liking school?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. It is very interesting... No.	
Message	Maria	"It is fun. At least I think it is fun. Through
talking with others, I tell them about myself,
and I learn about them. It is so exciting."	
Message	Shido	"If that's how you feel Maria, then I'm sure
you'll understand. There's so much you don't
know waiting for you. So many new things."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I wish to learn more. So that one day,
I can understand love."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I'll help you out too, Maria. Everyone
else is there for you, too."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Thank you. There are still many things
I have yet to understand about this world.
So I won't let you escape, okay?"	
Message	Shido	I hope that's just a joke... Haha.	
Message	None	"(In reality, there's no escape from this world,
and we haven't found a way out. But I'm aware
that's not what she means.)"	
Message	Maria	"Now then Shido, I would like to take another
detour, so would you accompany me?"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Where are we going?	
Message	Maria	The park. There is something I am interested in.	
Message	Shido	"The park? Well, we still have time, so stopping
by shouldn't be a problem."	
Message	Maria	Thank you. Then let us go, Shido.	
Message	Shido	So, what are you gonna do?	
Message	Maria	Would you like to take a small break?	
Message	None	"(As Maria said this, she pointed towards
a bench set up within the park.)"	
Message	Shido	A break?	
Message	Maria	"I wanted to see how it looked in the early
morning."	
Message	Shido	That's all?	
Message	Maria	Yes. That is all.	
Message	Shido	"So that's what you wanted...
Well, it's a lovely view after all."	
Message	Maria	Yes.	
Message	None	"(Maria trotted excitedly towards the bench,
and slowly sat herself down.)"	
Message	Maria	The breeze is so nice.	
Message	Shido	It is.	
Message	None	"(As Maria sat beneath the soft sunlight peeking
through the trees, she was enveloped in a sort
of bright, ethereal aura.)"	
Message	None	"(Although she was just sitting on a bench in
a non-descript park, it had a certain beauty
to it. Almost like a painting.)"	
Message	Maria	Won't you sit down, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'll be here watching you, Maria.	
Message	None	"(Now that I think about it, I felt surprised
that I wanted to sit beside her. I'd never been
taken by such a simple feeling like that.)"	
Message	None	"(No, maybe I can relate. There was a time
when everything felt new to me, when life
was full of surprises. Anyone can relate.)"	
Message	None	"(Watching the ever frank and straightforward
Maria, I start feeling somewhat nostalgic.)"	
Message	Shido	"I want to show her more. Maria... you'll see
it all."	
Message	Maria	Is something wrong, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"No... We should get going, Maria. If we stay
for too long, we might be late."	
Message	Maria	You are right. Let us head to school.	
Message	None	"(Maria stood up from the bench, and walked
over to me.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria?	
Message	Maria	Yes, what is it?	
Message	Shido	Let's experience more things together.	
Message	Maria	...Yes.	
Message	Shido	Looks like we made it just in time.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I am relieved to see we were not late.
Had we not been careful, you would have
been in great danger, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"D-Danger... I mean, the civic guidance teacher
is kinda scary, but not dangerous."	
Message	Maria	"No, that is not what I mean. I was referring to
Tohka Yatogami and the others asking for your
reason for being late."	
Message	Shido	"Ohhh, I get it now. I'm glad it didn't end up like
that. Actually, would you even call this a date?"	
Message	Maria	"Is this... not a date? It was my understanding
that spending time together this morning was
a date."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you're right. This is a proper date.	
Message	None	"(If we put it like that, it's a little
embarrassing.)"	
Message	Shido	Wait. Hm? I see people over there...	
Message	Tohka	Shido! What are you doing?!	
Message	Shido	Tohka! And everyone else...!	
Message	Kaguya	"How unexpected to find you here of all places.
I'd heard you left early for school because you
were on duty, but..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suspicion. What reason do you have for walking
with Arusu?"	
Message	None	"(We even left from our house early and
everything, and we still ran into them at
the gates...)"	
Message	Shido	Umm. This is...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun. It's no use. Did you possibly leave\nwith Arusu-chan without telling everyone?"	
Message	Shido	Sharp as always with this kind of stuff, Yoshinon.	
Message	Kurumi	What is the meaning of this, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi. As usual, perfect timing on your end.	
Message	Miku	"Darling, you're terrible. I went to your house
to meet you, and I was told you had already left.
To think you were on a date with Arusu-san!"	
Message	Shido	Miku, too...	
Message	Origami	Shido. I request an explanation.	
Message	Shido	"Y-You too, Origami...? Even if you had asked
for an explanation—well, you know..."	
Message	Shido	"We snuck out because we were scared
of this sort of situation."	
Message	Kotori	"Your timing is terrible. At this rate, you'll
be late. You know? That's how it is, so I'm
going in first."	
Message	Shido	Ah. Hey, Kotori?!	
Message	None	(You're not going to help me?!)	
Message	Shido	"If I'm being completely honest, I'm just doing
whatever might get us out of this world, okay?"	
Message	Origami	"I do understand the situation somewhat.
As compensation, let's make an agreement
that you will eat lunch together with me."	
Message	Miku	"He'll be having lunch together with me.
Then I'll forgive you, darling."	
Message	Tohka	No. Eat luncheon together with me, Shido!	
Message	Kaguya	Wait. The Yamai Sisters must stand up here.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Promise. Do not be swayed by the others'
sweet talk. Let's have lunch as us three."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmmhmhm, Shido-san. Don't you think your mind
won't be at ease with the others? Well, how
would you like to eat lunch alone, with just me?"	
Message	Yoshino	Um. Um, Shido-san...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Now's your chance, Yoshino! Use your authority\nas a teacher, and call out Shido-kun during\nlunch! Then you can have him all to yourself!"	
Message	Shido	"Y-You guys! If you would just let me explain,
then you'd understand!"	
Message	Ai	"Hey hey, look. They're having a lovers' quarrel
right at the front gates, this early in the
morning."	
Message	Mai	Is he trying to flaunt it? How awful.	
Message	Mii	That's totally gross.	
Message	Shido	"Rgh. Perfect of you to show up too! Either
way, right now, we're gonna be late. Let's
head to class already!"	
Message	Tohka	Wha! Wait up, Shido!	
Message	None	"(Without looking back at the people calling
at me, I left the scene in a hurry.)"
