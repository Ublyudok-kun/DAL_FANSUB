Message	Shido	Huh...	
Message	None	(What was I doing?)	
Message	Miku	What's the matter, darling?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Miku, you surprised me.	
Message	Miku	Whaaat～? You're so strange, darling.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, sorry. I was in a daze.	
Message	Miku	Darling, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	R-Right, Miku... You're Miku, right?	
Message	Miku	"Goodness. We finally have alone time.
Please be present～."	
Message	Shido	Sorry, sorry.	
Message	Miku	"Okay, so I can proceed with what we just
discussed?"	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What we just discussed? Uh, what were
we talking about again?"	
Message	Miku	"Argh! My! You're such a mess, darling. We
were talking about going home together after
school. We can meet at your classroom, okay?"	
Message	Shido	...Okay, let's do that. Then I'll see you later.	
Message	Miku	Okaaaaay! Wait for me, okay～?	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Leave it to me.	
Message	Miku	"I have to move classrooms, so I'm going to go
now, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Okay. I'll see you later.	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Miku	Here you go, darling.	
Message	Shido	Huh? What's up?	
Message	Miku	Give me a good-bye kiss.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Well, we're at school. Someone might
be watching."	
Message	Miku	Ugh, darling! You're such a meanie!	
Message	Shido	"I feel like we should do that kind of stuff when
we get to know each other better."	
Message	Miku	"Very well. I guess I'll have to wait until the
next time～."	
Message	Shido	Argh... Okay, I'll keep it in mind.	
Message	Miku	"Hehehe. Promise～. Anyways, I'll be on my
way."	
Message	None	"(Phew. That was a close one. I was almost
about to say good-bye before knowing what
I agreed to.)"	
Message	Ai	My. It's so gross to do that in broad daylight.	
Message	Mai	"Oh, so it's true, huh? That senior animal got
ahold of her."	
Message	Mii	What a turn off.	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Were you guys watching?	
Message	Ai	"Ugh. So gross. I'm running so his perversions
won't rub off on me."	
Message	Mai	Miku-senpai got with HIM? I'm shocked.	
Message	Mii	What a turn off.	
Message	Shido	Crap, of all the people to see us...	
Message	None	"(But I wonder if this is a good sign for what's
to come between us.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay, class is finally over.	
Message	None	"(I promised Miku that I'd go home with her,
but...)"	
Message	None	(Seems like Miku's homeroom isn't done yet.)	
Message	Mikie	Um, excuse me～.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Me?	
Message	Shido	Hey, are you from Class 2?	
Message	Mikie	Mikie Okamine, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	That's right. Mikie. What's up?	
Message	Mikie	"This is, um... Did you drop this earlier,
Shido-san?"	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Oh, my handkerchief. I totally didn't notice.
Thank you."	
Message	Mikie	"Oh, it's no problem at all. So Shido-san, do you
know where Origami-san went?"	
Message	Shido	"Origami? Oh, come to think of it, she said she
needed to talk with Tama-chan, so she
dropped by the teacher's lounge."	
Message	Mikie	Ah. She's at Tamae ne-san's place, I see?	
Message	Shido	Did you have plans to head home with Origami?	
Message	Mikie	"Haaaaau! Th-That's not it, but... I was hoping
to go home with her."	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. Then why don't you drop by the
teacher's lounge?"	
Message	Mikie	"I'll do that. Shido-san, are you waiting for
someone?"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Yeah, kinda.	
Message	Mikie	"I heard rumors of you and Miku, the senior.
Are they true?"	
Message	Shido	"Uh, yeah. They are. Wait, there are rumors
going around?"	
Message	Mikie	"Yes... A lot of them. I mean, Miku-san is
quite popular after all."	
Message	Shido	S-Seriously...? I had no idea.	
Message	Mikie	So are the rumors true? Are you two d-dating?	
Choice		Yes, we are.	
Choice		No, we're not.	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess you could say... we are.	
Message	Mikie	Fueeeee. You guys are!	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, but could you keep it secret? From what
you're telling me, there are lots of rumors going
around."	
Message	Mikie	Y-Yes, I promise!	
Message	Shido	Well... No, we're not really dating.	
Message	Mikie	Oh, really～.	
Message	Shido	Well, kind of, but we're almost there.	
Message	Mikie	But I think you two suit each other.	
Message	Shido	You think so?	
Message	Miku	Darling, sorry for the wait～.	
Message	Shido	Oh, you made it.	
Message	Miku	Apologies, darling～. I ran late.	
Message	Shido	It's totally fine. I was chatting with Mikie.	
Message	Mikie	H-Hello, Miku-san.	
Message	Miku	Oh, my. Hello～.	
Message	Mikie	"W-Well, I'm going to the teacher's lounge
now!"	
Message	Shido	Okay. Later.	
Message	Mikie	"Okay. Good-bye! Nice to meet you too,
Miku-san."	
Message	Miku	Farewell～.	
Message	Shido	Okay... Well, let's go home.	
Message	Miku	Hehe. Okay～.	
Message	Miku	"But darling, before we do that, there's
something I wanted to talk with you about."	
Message	None	(Huh? What could it be about?)	
Message	Shido	Sure, I don't mind.	
Message	Miku	Okay, then we'll do it here.	
Message	None	(Miku's acting strange all of a sudden...)	
Message	Miku	Hey, darling...?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Shido	?! Huh?!	
Message	Miku	Who's... that woman?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's gotten into you?!	
Message	Miku	Just answer me... Who was that woman, darling?	
Message	Shido	"Wait a minute. Who are you talking about?
That girl?"	
Message	Miku	"Don't play dumb. The girl you were just flirting
with."	
Message	Shido	Wait, are you talking about Mikie?	
Message	Miku	Yes, yesssss. Whatever her name may be.	
Message	Shido	I wasn't flirting with her. We were just talking.	
Message	Miku	"You're lying through your teeth. Not cool,
darling. She was totally kissing up to you.
I could see her inching closer."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. She wasn't doing that. It's not
like I even know her that well."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, you seemed to be enjoying yourself
too. Your eyes were beaming when she was
here."	
Message	Shido	"I was not! Absolutely not! What's the deal,
Miku? You're letting it bother you too much."	
Message	Miku	"No one can ever approach my darling. Do
you understand that?"	
Message	Shido	What...? That's a bit much.	
Message	Miku	A bit much...? So she's just a classmate?	
Choice		Yeah.	
Choice		She's a little cute.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. She's just an acquaintance. Like I told
you, we don't know each other well. She just
happened to strike up a conversation."	
Message	Miku	Are you sure...?	
Message	Shido	Yes, I'm sure. So stop intimidating me.	
Message	Miku	Then, the handkerchief.	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Miku	"She gave you a handkerchief, didn't she? What
does that mean?"	
Message	Shido	"This is a misunderstanding. It was mine. She
saw me drop it, and picked it up for me."	
Message	Miku	Then, give it to me.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Give what to you?	
Message	Miku	The handkerchief. Come on. Hurry.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. Who cares? I'll wash it when
I get home."	
Message	Miku	"What are you talking about? That woman
touched it, and it's now dirty. I'll toss it for
you."	
Message	Shido	"No, that's a waste. I can't throw it away for
something silly like that."	
Message	Miku	Nooo～.	
Message	Shido	Aah!	
Message	Miku	"I'll give you mine, unless there's something more
to it?"	
Message	Miku	"You better not say you'd rather have hers,
would you?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, no... Calm down, Miku?! What the―?!
You're taking scary stuff out of your bag!"	
Message	Miku	...Are you sure?	
Message	Shido	Positive!	
Message	Miku	Then, let me borrow it～.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Miku	I'll get rid of this, okay?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... Thanks.	
Message	Miku	"Oh, I'm so glad we came to an agreement, darling.
What a relief."	
Message	Shido	Man, Miku... You're overreacting.	
Message	Miku	Hey, darling...?	
Message	Shido	What could it be now?	
Message	Miku	If you ever cheat...	
Message	Shido	Whoa!!! Okay, okay! I get it, so put it away!	
Message	Miku	"""Then tell me you love me～. If you can say,
""I love you,"" to me, then I'll forgive you for
this incident."""	
Message	None	(F-Forgive me? I didn't do anything wrong.)	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. I'll say it, so listen up, okay?	
Message	Miku	Okay ♪	
Message	Shido	...I-I love you, Miku.	
Message	Miku	More than the whole wide world?	
Message	Shido	Yes. I love you more than anything in the world.	
Message	Miku	More than anyone...?	
Message	Shido	I-I love you more than anyone.	
Message	Miku	Hehe. Aw, darling...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Miku	I... love you, too.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(Uh, so... What should I do?)	
Message	Shido	Well, she's kind of cute.	
Message	Miku	I see...	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Um, Miku-san...?	
Message	Miku	So you were hitting on her, were you?	
Message	Shido	W-Well, I didn't, but...	
Message	Miku	I guess I have no choice...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, come on! Hear me out!	
Message	Miku	"Hear you out? So you can tell me how you
were smitten? I really don't like it."	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait! Please. Just calm down!	
Message	Miku	You know, I always knew she was suspicious.	
Message	Miku	"She got near my darling. Despite you being my
darling, I bet you anything she's in the shadows,
laughing. I hate her. I HATE HER! I'll kill―"	
Message	Shido	"WHOAAAAAAAAAAA! Miku, MIKU! Calm down!
Listen to me!"	
Message	Miku	"Don't worry. I'll save you from that wretched
woman..."	
Message	Shido	"Enough. I said she was cute, but I didn't mean
anything by it."	
Message	Miku	Move away, darling. Or else I can't kill her.	
Message	Shido	Miku!	
Message	Miku	I'll rid you of any pests who go near you...	
Message	Shido	Miku!	
Message	Miku	"Darling belongs to me. You're only my darling,
right?"	
Message	Shido	"I didn't mean it. You're cuter, Miku! I think
you're the cutest girl in the whole world!"	
Message	Miku	...?!	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant*...	
Message	Miku	Darling, did you say something just now?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I did. I said Mikie was cute, but you're
way cuter. I said you're the cutest girl in the
whole world."	
Message	Miku	"Really? You better not be trying to butter me
up."	
Message	Shido	Of course not. You're the cutest girl I know.	
Message	Miku	Am I cute?	
Message	Shido	To me, Miku, you'll always be number one.	
Message	Miku	...	
Message	Miku	...Hehe.	
Message	Miku	Hehehehehe.	
Message	Miku	"Darling... said I'm the cutest. That he loves me
more than anyone. That he only has eyes for me.
That he'll never talk to another woman. Hehehe."	
Message	None	(I don't think I said that much...)	
Message	None	"(But it calmed her down, so I'm going to leave
this conversation where it is.)"
