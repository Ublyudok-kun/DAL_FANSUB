Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Mana	...Ohh!	
Message	None	"(I saw a familiar head of hair across the street.
As the thought came to me, the girl ran towards
me.)"	
Message	Mana	Ohhh, Nii-sama!	
Message	Shido	Urk! Mana?!	
Message	Mana	"I'm freaking stoked that I could meet you in
a place like this! This must be fate."	
Message	Mana	"Man, you really are my Nii-sama! It's like
that sibling bond connects us together."	
Message	Shido	Okay, I get it. Please calm down!	
Message	None	"(I hold back Mana, who's grabbed my hand
as she jumps up and down. I can hardly
believe she's an NPC.)"	
Message	Shido	Were you out shopping?	
Message	Mana	Yep, just over there!	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait. What's with the mountain of ¥100-shop
goods?)"	
Message	None	"(Inside of Mana's plastic bag was a plethora
of colorful plastic goods.)"	
Message	None	"(It looks like she spent a fortune at the
¥100-shop.)"	
Message	Mana	"Japan's freaking incredible! You can get so
many convenient things here."	
Message	Mana	See, Nii-sama! Check this out!	
Message	None	"(Mana pulled out a sponge with a handle. The
body was bent, allowing its user to move the
sponge at many different angles.)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Mana	"It's like you're so freaking shocked that you
can't speak. An ergonomic sponge that can
reach anywhere. Talk about a freaking deal."	
Message	Shido	"No. Wait, Mana... That's actually not too
practical. It's better to use a regular sponge."	
Message	Mana	"No, no. With this angle, I can easily wash my
back."	
Message	Shido	"It's not really adjustable, so you're making it
harder for yourself."	
Message	Mana	"Oh...
"	
Message	Mana	"Hmph. You've got no freaking imagination,
Nii-sama."	
Message	None	(Mana punched me lightly.)	
Message	None	"(She's reliable when battling a Spirit, but
seeing her act like this, I remember she's
just a kid.)"	
Message	None	"(In fact, if she's buying all this crap, I'm
starting to worry about her everyday life.)"	
Message	Shido	"If you keep buying weird stuff like this, you'll
have no room at home. Don't buy things you
don't need, got it?"	
Message	Mana	Okaaaay...	
Message	None	"(Mana, appearing displeased, puffed out
her cheeks. However, she became cheerful
again in no time.)"	
Message	Mana	"But I've never been scolded like this by
you, Nii-sama! Even though you're upset,
it still makes me freaking happy!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, now. Keep it together, okay?	
Message	Mana	Right!	
Message	None	"(Seeing Mana smile happily makes me smile too.
Well, I guess I'll see her again... whenever
she cleans her room.)"
