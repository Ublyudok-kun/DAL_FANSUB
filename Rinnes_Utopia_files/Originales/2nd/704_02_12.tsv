Message	Shido	Hm? Oh, Kusakabe-san?	
Message	Kusakabe	Um... Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Hello. Are you out shopping?	
Message	Kusakabe	"Ah, dear... You caught me in an embarrassing
moment."	
Message	None	"(There was a supermarket bag next to
Kusakabe-san. Inside were cup noodles,
and packaged side dishes peeking out.)"	
Message	None	(Hmm. They're all ready-made items.)	
Message	Shido	These are all terrible for your diet.	
Message	Kusakabe	"My ears hurt... I know that, but I can't
help but depend on these."	
Message	Shido	"If you'd like, maybe I can teach you some easy
recipes?"	
Message	Kusakabe	"I'm grateful, but I never know when I'll be
deployed on duty. I can't really spend too
much time cooking."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see.	
Message	Kusakabe	Well, I wish I could, but it's a pain.	
Message	None	"(Kusakabe-san smiles brightly, but carrying the
burden of her team must be harder than I can
imagine.)"	
Message	None	(Putting that aside...)	
Message	Shido	Is beer all right?	
Message	Kusakabe	"That goes in a different stomach. It's fuel for
adults."	
Message	None	"(I feel like this is a bigger red flag than the
instant food. Should I be worried...?)"	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh, man. I wish I had a wife like you,
Itsuka-kun."	
Message	Shido	Er, well...	
Message	Kusakabe	See you around, then. Give my regards to Origami.	
Message	Shido	Yes... Hm? Wife?
