Message	Tonomachi	Itsuka, let's hit the arcade.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. It's been a while. Might be fun.	
Message	Tonomachi	Ohhh?! This is a rare occurrence.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Well, lately, whenever I've invited you
places, you refuse me.

Message	Tonomachi	Dates, dates, dates, dates... 	
Message	Tonomachi	Wait, whoa!	
Message	Shido	Huh?! Why are you snapping at me? Calm down!	
Message	Tonomachi	"How could you possibly understand my feelings?!
Playing mahjong, sad and alone?!"	
Message	Shido	No, I can't understand that.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Then after all of that, at the start of the game,
I take Tenhou and immediately Game Over?!
Give me back my ¥100!"	
Message	Shido	"There's nothing I can do about that, even if you
tell me..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Today I'll finally have you to distract me from
my sorrows!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, come on... Hm? Oh, shoot. Tonomachi,
I have to pass on the arcade after all."	
Message	Tonomachi	It's a date, isn't it?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it is.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Some friend you are! I hope you eat a yakuman
and never score again!"	
Message	Shido	Ah... He left. Oh well. It's Tonomachi.
