Message	None	"(My name is Shido Itsuka. I'm an ordinary high school
student.)"	
Message	None	"(So what am I doing this late in the night? Don't even
ask.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, it's kind of a secret that I'm at the bookstore
in front of the station to buy a book I really enjoy.)"	
Message	Shido	"...Just kidding. I just really wanted to read the
comic book that's coming out today."	
Message	Shido	"It's rare that I'm out this late. I can't help but
feel so excited... Haha."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well... I'll just stop messing around and hurry
home."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the?! That's bright!	
Message	Kotori	You there. You have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Hm... This voice...	
Message	Kotori	I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.	
Message	Shido	"...Kotori, is that you? What are you doing dressed
like that..."	
Message	Kotori	...Hmph!	
Message	Shido	Hnrg! Wh-What the hell?!	
Message	Kotori	"And what's your problem? Talking to me like I'm your
friend. I'm a cop that was recently stationed here.
You watch how you speak to me."	
Message	Shido	"Um, but you're totally Kotori! And... even if you were
a cop, what kind of cop punches someone they just
met?!"	
Message	Kotori	This kind. You're looking at her.	
Message	Shido	That's not something to be proud of!	
Message	Kotori	What, you want to start a fight with me? Bring it on.	
Message	Shido	...Whatever, fine. So what do you want?	
Message	Kotori	...Hmph!	
Message	Shido	"Oof! What the... a second time... *cough*. I didn't do
anything!"	
Message	Kotori	"You have an attitude problem. You're an outlier on
the fringes of society."	
Message	Shido	"You're the one with the attitude problem! You hit a
random stranger twice."	
Message	Kotori	"Stop your bitchin' already. You look like a sex
predator. That level of grossness must be contagious."	
Message	Shido	No way! And I'm not a sexual predator!	
Message	Kotori	"I say one thing, and you talk back. I just asked you
to answer some questions. Or do you have something
to hide?"	
Message	Shido	"Damn it. I'm supposed to be responding with the
truth but why am I the one being sucked into this?
You're like my little sister."	
Message	Kotori	"I'm not talking about your super cute, wise little sister.
Just answer my question."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, seriously, let's be honest. You're totally
Koto―"	
Message	Kotori	What's that?!	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing... So, what did you want to ask me?	
Message	None	"(I can't expose my body to any more danger. I'm not
going to open my mouth anymore...)"	
Message	Kotori	"There's been a sexual predator around here lately.
So I'm walking around asking questions."	
Message	Shido	"I see. I didn't know that was happening. What do you
want to ask me...?"	
Message	Kotori	Right. Well, did you do it?	
Message	Shido	Trust me. I didn't do anything like that.	
Message	Shido	"Who even asks that?! Wouldn't you normally ask the
individual if they saw anything?! Why are you asking
if I did it?"	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. I just phrased it wrong. Gosh. You're so
nitpicky."	
Message	None	"(D-Damn it... It's not worth responding, I'll just get
tired...)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, ask me again. I don't think I'll be much
help, though."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph, fine I'll ask again. So there's been a sexual
predator lately..."	
Message	Shido	Yeah?	
Message	Kotori	Now's your chance to come clean.	
Message	Shido	HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT?!	
Message	Shido	"Forget it. I'll answer first. I don't remember doing
anything, nor have I witnessed anything. I just want
to go home. Later."	
Message	Kotori	Wait a minute.	
Message	None	(I'm going to ignore her. I'll just go home.)	
Message	Kotori	I told you to HOLD ON!	
Message	Shido	"OUCH! What the hell are you doing?! I'm an ordinary
civilian!"	
Message	Kotori	"I already asked you nicely to wait. I had more questions
to ask, but you're the one who tried to go home."	
Message	Shido	"Even if that was the case, what cop does a round-
house kick on a civilian?!"	
Message	Kotori	This one. You're looking at her.	
Message	Shido	Enough with that already! That's quite enough!	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, what's your problem... Please, just let me go
home."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. Your attitude's starting to sound mighty
disobedient. Fine. Then I'll just get it over with."	
Message	Kotori	"You look like you're in high school. What are you
doing walking around this late? I don't think it's
appropriate for your age."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt* You're actually asking a legitimate question.	
Message	Kotori	"What were you doing out this late? Depending on your
answer, I may detain you."	
Message	Shido	Well, um...	
Message	None	"(What do I do? I can be honest, but would Kotori be
satisfied with that? I'd rather just get this
conversation over with and go home.)"	
Message	None	"(But it doesn't mean that being honest will actually
accomplish that. I'll have to answer her in a way that
she'd be satisfied. I want to read my comic book!)"	
Message	Shido	So then my answer should be...	
Choice		I was hanging out at the arcade.	
Choice		I was looking for a cute girl like you!	
Choice		I was buying a comic book.	
Message	Shido	"I was hanging out at the arcade in front of the
station. Excuse me."	
Message	None	"(Instead of telling her the truth, I'll pretend I was up
to no good. It'll give her something to scold me about
and she'll get her fix...!)"	
Message	Shido	"I was going to go home earlier, but I was super into
it and lost track of time. I'm sorry."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Got it. Then let's have you come down to the
station."	
Message	Shido	WHY?!	
Message	Kotori	"What do you mean, why? You were hanging out till
this late, right? I'm going to scold you properly, so
come with me to the station."	
Message	Shido	No, no, no, no! That's totally messed up!	
Message	Kotori	Excuse me? Tell me, what about it is messed up?	
Message	Shido	"Look at the time. Can't you just scold me a bit here
and then tell me to hurry home? I mean, that's normal!"	
Message	Kotori	Right. If it's normal.	
Message	Shido	"Right? Then why am I being taken to the station?
That'll make my return home even later..."	
Message	Kotori	"Because you don't look apologetic at all. You totally
have that "I'll just act sorry and she'll let me off
the hook" attitude..."	
Message	None	(Crap... She's actually sharp.)	
Message	Kotori	And besides...	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	"Your acting like you felt bad was gross. Almost like
an ugly dog kissing up."	
Message	Shido	That's so messed up!	
Message	Shido	"Damn it, This is going nowhere. I'm just going to go
through!"	
Message	Kotori	Hey, wait!	
Message	Shido	"Shut up. You're picking a fight with me. I just want
to go home and read my comic book! You get out of
my way!"	
Message	Shido	AH!	
Message	Kotori	Hyaaa!	
Message	Shido	...Oh, um.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Uh, that was... an accident...	
Message	Kotori	Caught you red handed...	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Kotori	"An act of a bonafide sexual predator... Hehehe.
Hehehehe."	
Message	Shido	W-Wait. Let's talk about this! We can get through it!	
Message	Shido	Hehehehehe.	
Message	Kotori	"Wh-What's your problem? What's with that laugh all of
a sudden?"	
Message	Shido	Hehehehe... Uhehehe.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, listen, hot cop. You see... I was looking for a
cute girl like you hanging around town!"	
Message	Kotori	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!	
Message	Shido	"Oh come on, what's the problem? Why don't you come
to paradise with me!"	
Message	Kotori	No, no, no, no! Stop!	
Message	Shido	"Come on, now. Did I scare you? You sure did a number
on me back there. Now it's your time, Miss Cop."	
Message	Kotori	N-No!	
Message	None	(...I think this is enough.)	
Message	Shido	Just kidding.	
Message	Shido	"I was only playing around, Miss Cop. I was just buying
a book. There's nothing suspicious..."	
Message	None	(Well I did put some acting into it as payback.)	
Message	Kotori	Ah... Ah...	
Message	Shido	What's the matter? Can't you get up?	
Message	Kotori	*Grunt*... It was so sudden, I was just surprised...	
Message	Shido	"Ah, you lost all feeling in your legs, huh... Sorry, I
guess I went too far."	
Message	Kotori	...Sorry, can you lend me a hand?	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	HMPH!	
Message	Shido	GAH!	
Message	Kotori	"How dare you make fun of me... Anyways... I guess we
have no choice but to do it."	
Message	Shido	"What am I going to do?! You just said something really
scary!"	
Message	Shido	I was out buying a book.	
Message	None	"(I have nothing to hide. I'm sure if I'm honest with
her, it'll be okay.)"	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Content that a high school student can't buy...
right? I mean, going out this late at night to buy it,
it's so suspicious."	
Message	Shido	"I knew you'd say that! I totally knew it! I'm just
buying a comic book!"	
Message	Kotori	"Hah, I doubt it. But if you insist, then I guess I can
take a look. What's inside that bag?"	
Message	Shido	Fine. But as soon as you see it, let me go, okay?	
Message	None	"(Honestly, I don't see why I have to show her, but
if I fight it, it'll be more of a nuisance. So I'm just
going to show her what's inside and go home.)"	
Message	Shido	Wait. I'll open the bag now.	
Message	Kotori	No, I'll open it myself, so hand it over.	
Message	Shido	I refuse. I mean, you could damage the pages.	
Message	Kotori	"*Grunt*... Fine. Hurry up, then. Who do you think I
am..."	
Message	Shido	"...A violent lady who'd punch someone as soon as
she met them?"	
Message	Kotori	Huh?!	
Message	Shido	...Nothing.	
Message	Kotori	I see. Hurry up.	
Message	None	"(*Sigh*... Seriously I want to get this over with. I
mean, the inside of this bag is...)"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	(Wh-What the. What's going on?)	
Message	None	"(I bought a comic book at the bookstore. But why is
the content in this bag an erotic book...?!)"	
Message	None	"(I can't believe it. Right in front of me is an
inappropriate book. It even has the typical lewd
headlines.)"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the... Why? What happened...?!	
Message	Kotori	I'm still waiting.	
Message	Shido	W-Wait!	
Message	Kotori	...?! Wh-Why are you screaming all of a sudden?	
Message	Shido	"Well, u-um... D-Don't move. Th-The tape. It's stuck
on the book. I'll take it off, so don't touch me, okay?"	
Message	Kotori	*Sigh*... What's taking you so long? Hurry up.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I'm working on it.	
Message	Shido	"What's going on? Did the person at the register give
me the wrong item? No, I don't even care right now.
I have to get out of this situation."	
Message	Shido	"The path that I thought would be the safest was the
worst trap. This is a book bomb. And it's about to
explode...! What are you going to do, Shido Itsuka?!"	
Message	Shido	"I need to get out of this bind. Do I show her? Show
her my book? That's the worst! I can't!"	
Message	Shido	"I'll have to make an excuse. No, it's not going to
fly. She's crazy violent. There's no way I'll survive.
She's not going to listen to what I have to say."	
Message	Shido	"My only choice is to just plow through. If I run for it,
the gender difference should allow me to get away..."	
Message	Kotori	"What are you mumbling about? Okay.. Time's up.
Hurry up and hand it over."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Kotori	"You're bag is totally open. You shoulda hurried up and
given it to..."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Um.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, oh...	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm actually into little sisters. I guess you're my
type? Just kidding... Hahaha."	
Message	Kotori	...I see.	
Message	None	(I totally blew it. I think I stepped on the final mine.)	
Message	Kotori	Public... misdemeanor...	
Message	Shido	It's over.	
Message	Shido	Why is this happening to me...	
Message	None	"(The cop is shaking, breathing heavily in front of
me.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey Miss Cop? Please calm down and let me explain.	
Message	Kotori	How can I stay calm?!	
Message	Shido	"P-Please wait. I couldn't help it. I was just
emotional. I totally feel bad!"	
Message	Kotori	Wait a minute! I won't let you get away with it!	
Message	None	"(That day, my screams echoed throughout the starlit
town.)"
