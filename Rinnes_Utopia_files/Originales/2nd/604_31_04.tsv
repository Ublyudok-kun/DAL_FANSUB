Message	Shido	...It's morning.	
Message	Shido	What time is it―Oh God, look at the time!	
Message	Shido	Wh-Why didn't anyone wake me―	
Message	None	"(I rushed to grab my uniform, and glanced over at the
calendar.)"	
Message	Shido	...Oh, today's my day off.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Man, that scared me...	
Message	Shido	"But regardless... Why hasn't anyone come to wake me
up yet?"	
Message	None	"(Usually someone would already be in my room by
now...)"	
Message	Shido	Come to think of it, where are Kotori and Tohka?	
Message	Shido	No one's... here?	
Message	Shido	...Are they both out?	
Message	Shido	...Hold on a moment!	
Message	Shido	Coming!	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi? Wh-What are you doing here?!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh? You're acting quite strange.	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, is it that weird for your girlfriend to
come pay you a visit?"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?! Girlfriend?!	
Message	None	"(Seeing my reaction, Kurumi tilted her head in
confusion.)"	
Message	Kurumi	My, is that really something to be surprised over?	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, you're my boyfriend. It's been a while
since we started dating."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... That's right, huh... Sorry, I just woke up, so I
guess I'm still out of it."	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh, could you not inflict such pain to my heart?	
Message	Shido	Um... Sorry, Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Is that all?	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(Seeing my reaction, Kurumi dramatically put both
hands over her chest.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"My love for Shido-san came to fruition and we were
finally able to date..."	
Message	Kurumi	"...And this is how you treat me? That is too cruel.
It's so terribly unfortunate."	
Message	Shido	I'm so sorry... It completely slipped my mind...	
Message	Kurumi	"So my feelings are something that just slips your mind
when you awaken... I'm so sad. I'm going to cry."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... Kurumi?! Wh-What should I do...	
Message	None	"(I didn't know what to do and panicked, but Kurumi had
a mischievous smile on her face.)"	
Message	None	(Seems like she was playing with me.)	
Message	Shido	...Gosh.	
Message	Shido	"I'm really sorry, Kurumi. I'll do anything to make it
up to you!"	
Message	None	"(Saying I'd do anything might be dangerous, but I need
Kurumi to forgive me.)"	
Message	Shido	So please, don't be upset.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, so you'll really do anything?	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Shido	S-Sure. If it's within my abilities.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi accepted my words and smiled happily, clapping
her hands together.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Then... I want you to go on a date with me.	
Message	Shido	What? Right now?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, you won't? So were your words all lies?	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, you really don't care about me...	
Message	Kurumi	Ah, I'm so sad. I'm going to cry.	
Message	Shido	N-No... That's not true!	
Message	Shido	Okay, fine. Let's go on a date!	
Message	None	(Worst case, we can just hang out at home...)	
Message	Kurumi	"...Shido-san, I hope you're not thinking that we could
just stay here at your house."	
Message	Shido	O-Of course I'm not!	
Message	Kurumi	Then let's go. Hehe.	
Message	None	"(I feel like she managed to slip this through, but it
wasn't that difficult of a request so I guess it's
fine.)"	
Message	Shido	"Th-Then Kurumi... I'll go get ready. Can you wait in
the living room?"	
Message	Kurumi	Sure.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Did you eat breakfast already?	
Message	Kurumi	No, not yet.	
Message	Shido	"Then let's eat together. As soon as I get changed, I'll
make it quickly."	
Message	Kurumi	"Sure, I'd love that. I'd never turn down an invitation
from you."	
Message	None	"(That made me happy, and I ran to my room with a
lighter step than earlier.)"	
Message	None	"(After I got ready, I made a simple breakfast to eat
with Kurumi before we went to the shopping district.)"	
Message	Shido	It sure is a nice day.	
Message	Kurumi	It sure is.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san... Where do you want to go first?	
Message	Shido	"Hmmm. Is there any place in particular that you'd like
to go?"	
Message	Kurumi	Anywhere is fine.	
Message	Shido	...What? A-Anywhere...	
Message	Kurumi	Anywhere is fun, as long as I'm with you.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi looked up at me with innocent eyes, and her
cheeks were faintly flushed with pink.)"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	(Seeing Kurumi like that made my heart flutter.)	
Message	Kurumi	Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh, um...	
Message	Shido	H-Hmm. Let's just walk around for now.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Well then, please lead the way.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi's gentle gaze made me blush, so I went to
scratch my cheek, but... something soft kept me from
moving.)"	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	Well... Um...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi entwined her arm around mine. I could feel
warmth on my arm, and wavered.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"We're dating. It's natural for me to lock arms with
you."	
Message	Shido	Huh... R-Right!	
Message	Shido	You're right! We're dating, so it's only natural, huh?	
Message	None	"(I tried to convince myself by answering
energetically.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Heh... Shido-san, you're such an honest person.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kurumi	Now, Shido-san... Let's go.	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	None	(And so our date began.)	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi, it's almost lunch time. Do you want to eat
anything?"	
Message	Kurumi	I'll leave it up to you today.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Then... My favorite place is nearby, so let me
take you there."	
Message	Kurumi	Your favorite place, huh? Hehe... I can't wait.	
Message	Kurumi	Hey, Shido-san? There actually is something I want.	
Message	Shido	Something you want? Sure. Where are we going?	
Message	Kurumi	Can you follow me to this store?	
Message	Shido	"Sure thing. But what are you looking for? Clothes?
A hat?"	
Message	Kurumi	No, what I want today is a swimsuit.	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see. A swim―Wait, a swimsuit?!	
Message	Kurumi	Is there a problem?	
Message	Shido	No, but...	
Message	Kurumi	"You'll pick out a swimsuit that will suit me, won't
you?"	
Message	Shido	What the...?!	
Message	Kurumi	"I know it's off-season, but please take me to Ocean
Park some time."	
Message	Kurumi	"Or... Would you rather choose lingerie for me like on
our last date?"	
Message	Shido	C-Come on, give me a break!	
Message	Kurumi	Well, I'm not completely joking here.	
Message	Kurumi	"I would wear any underwear you chose for me,
Shido-san..."	
Message	Shido	A-Any... underwear?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I'd be happy to wear whichever one you liked.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi looked at me with a sensual smile. I
suddenly pictured her in immodest underwear and
gulped.)"	
Message	Shido	"―Hah, no, no! Forget about that. Let's just buy what
we came here for!"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Don't be so coy...	
Message	Shido	D-Don't make fun of me!	
Message	Kurumi	My, but I'm really not.	
Message	Shido	A-Anyways... We're going to go buy a swimsuit, right?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I'd like that.	
Message	Shido	W-Well... that's fine, then.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe.	
Message	Shido	...Ah, look at the time.	
Message	Kurumi	It went by so quickly.	
Message	Shido	I know...	
Message	None	"(A sudden date with Kurumi. In the end, it was a lot
nicer than I expected. I stopped and gave a big yawn.)"	
Message	Shido	Man, we sure did do a lot today.	
Message	None	"(After we shopped, we ate lunch and shopped again.
We then went into a café to rest. Nothing special,
but it was fun.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, so it seems.	
Message	None	(Kurumi then stopped and peered into my face.)	
Message	Kurumi	I, too... had a lot of fun today.	
Message	None	"(And she gave me the biggest smile of the day. I felt
her steal my heart for a second.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san? Is something the matter?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi noticed my gaze and gave a naughty smile
as she whispered into my ear. I gulped.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Err...	
Message	Shido	...Um, it makes me... happy that you'd say th―	
Message	None	(Before I could continue...)	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	(I saw Tohka and Kotori in my line of vision.)	
Message	Shido	Kotori, Tohka...	
Message	None	"(Before I knew it, I whispered their names. They
were walking together with a big bag. It seemed like
they've been out shopping since this morning.)"	
Message	None	"(Neither of them noticed us. They were laughing and
talking as they headed home.)"	
Message	Kurumi	What's the matter...?	
Message	None	"(From afar, they looked like sisters. I couldn't help
but smile seeing that.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san? Is something the matter?	
Message	None	(Kurumi noticed and jumped into my line of vision.)	
Message	Shido	Whoa...?!	
Message	Kurumi	What caught your attention?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, um... Sorry. Anyways, back to what we were
saying―"	
Message	Kurumi	Hey, Shido-san. What were you looking at earlier?	
Message	Shido	Oh, well, um...	
Message	Shido	"Y-You see, Tohka and Kotori just passed by. They've
been missing since this morning, so I was curious what
happened."	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	U-Um... Kurumi-san?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi had her usual bewitching smile as she stared
at me. Could she be mad?)"	
Choice		Just apologize	
Choice		Stay quiet and see how she reacts	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	None	"(Seems like she's mad. I don't know why, but I think I
should just apologize. I bowed down to Kurumi.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi... Um, sorry.	
Message	Kurumi	"...Shido-san, I don't think you did anything you need
to apologize for."	
Message	Shido	But I was with you, so...	
Message	Shido	"I thought you were mad because... Um... We kind of
stopped mid-conversation."	
Message	Kurumi	Kehe. Kehehe... I suppose.	
Message	None	"(Her laugh seems very scary...! This isn't good.
Seriously, not good at all!)"	
Message	Shido	U-Um... I'm really sorry!	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Gosh, Shido-san. You're apologizing in such
a weird way."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kurumi	I guess I'll let this slide for today.	
Message	Shido	I'm so glad...	
Message	None	(It really seemed dangerous a second ago.)	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. But I must punish you, Shido-san, for ignoring
a girl's heart."	
Message	Shido	P-Punish?!	
Message	Kurumi	"It's not that big of a deal. I'm going to leave a mark
on you."	
Message	Shido	A mark...?	
Message	Kurumi	Come this way...	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi... What do you plan on doing here?	
Message	Shido	And what did you mean by "mark"...?	
Message	Kurumi	You'll know in just a second.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, come this way.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(I did as I was told and moved toward Kurumi. She
suddenly put her arms around me.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, K-Kurumi?!	
Message	None	(Kurumi put her arms around me, and―)	
Message	Kurumi	Muah...	
Message	Shido	Hyauh?!	
Message	None	(Kurumi suddenly kissed my neck.)	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, you're screaming like a girl...	
Message	Shido	W-Well... I mean...	
Message	None	"(Any healthy boy would scream if someone did that
to them so suddenly.)"	
Message	None	"(But it's true. I was so surprised that my voice shot
up.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. That was cute. Very adorable.	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi. Wait―	
Message	Kurumi	Muah, muah―	
Message	Shido	Kuuu...! S-Stop it...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi now licked the area she just kissed. A warm
and comforting feeling danced across my neck―)"	
Message	Kurumi	Won't let you.	
Message	Shido	Whoa...?!	
Message	None	"(The feeling of Kurumi's beautiful, soft body, her
sweet scent―I felt her all over my body.)"	
Message	None	"(Every time Kurumi's tongue grazed me or her lips
touched me, I could see sparks coming out of my
eyes, and my consciousness was about to go.)"	
Message	Shido	*sigh*... K-Kurumi, no... You can't do any more...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... Shido-san, you coward.	
Message	Kurumi	Then, I guess I'll make my mark soon.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	The mark that will prove that you are mine―	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	It'll be over soon. So just stand still.	
Message	Kurumi	―Mmmmuuuaaaaah!	
Message	None	"(Just then, I felt a jolt of pain. It felt like a kiss
from a vampire as Kurumi sucked on my neck.)"	
Message	Shido	...*grunt*.	
Message	None	(As I felt the sweet pain, Kurumi's lips left me.)	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san, now you are mine.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi whispered in my ear, satisfied. She finally
let go of me... and slowly started to walk.)"	
Message	None	"(She seemed mad. I didn't want to make excuses and
upset her more, so I decided to see how she reacted.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(As we looked at one another, Kurumi suddenly looked
away. She seemed a little troubled.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Will you not continue where you left off?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh... r-right.	
Message	None	"(Seems like she forgave me. For a second, she looked
like she was pouting, but it was surprisingly cute.)"	
Message	Shido	U-Um...	
Message	Shido	"Well... If you had fun today Kurumi, that makes me
really happy."	
Message	Shido	That's what I wanted to say earlier.	
Message	None	"(I scratched my cheek while I said it, and for a
second Kurumi's eyes sparkled as she gave me a
warm smile.) "	
Message	Kurumi	...Gosh.	
Message	Kurumi	If you say that, Shido-san, how can I not forgive you?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	But Shido-san. I don't want to share you with anyone.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi looked even more bewitching than usual and
walked up to me.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san?	
Message	Kurumi	Can you close your eyes just a little?	
Message	Shido	—Huh?! Wh-What are you going to do?	
Message	Kurumi	That's... for you to find out.	
Message	Kurumi	Now, now. Hurry and close your eyes.	
Message	Kurumi	Now...	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(She looked at me with puppy dog eyes. She was so
cute, I did as I was told and closed my eyes.)"	
Message	Shido	...Th-They're closed.	
Message	Kurumi	Muah...	
Message	Shido	Whoa?!	
Message	None	(Kurumi suddenly kissed me.)	
Message	Shido	Hey. K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	This is proof of contract.	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	Proof that you and I are connected, Shido-san.	
Message	Kurumi	"So, Shido-san... I'll put a mark on you so it's even
clearer to see."	
Message	Kurumi	Proof... that you belong to me... Hehehe.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Mm...	
Message	Shido	*grunt*... Ah...	
Message	Kurumi	You feel me, don't you? That makes me happy...	
Message	Kurumi	Fuun... Hm...	
Message	Shido	Oh. K-Kurumi...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi's soft lips and warm tongue touched the base
of my neck. Every time she moved, I felt an electric
sensation go through me.)"	
Message	Kurumi	I love you... I love you so much, I can't help it.	
Message	Kurumi	―Muah.	
Message	Shido	―*grunt*!	
Message	None	"(I felt pain shoot up my neck. It's as if a fang just
bit into me. But the pain was just for a split-second.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Hehe. This makes you all mine, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	―Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. It's almost time. Shall we go together...
Shido-san?"	
Message	None	"(Kurumi muttered next to my ear, satisfied, and
silently stepped away from me... She began to walk
away as if she were doing a light dance step.)"	
Message	None	"(And so our date ended. I should have been the one
to walk her home, but for some reason she walked me.
I didn't want that, but I guess she lived further...)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Hehe. I really had fun today.	
Message	Shido	That makes me happy.	
Message	Kurumi	Hey, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	What is it, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	"I want to hurry and wear the swimsuit you chose for
me."	
Message	Kurumi	"So next time, I want us to go somewhere I can wear
my swimsuit."	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. That makes me happy.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi then put her finger on her lips and gave a
mischievous smile.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Seeing Kurumi's lips as pink as cherry blossoms, I
remembered what we had just done, and blushed.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah?!	
Message	Kurumi	Don't hide that mark, okay?	
Message	Shido	Huh... Mark?	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. You'll know when you look in the mirror. I'll be
off now."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Kurumi?	
Message	None	"(And with that, Kurumi smiled and walked off before I
could stop her.)"	
Message	None	"(After Kurumi left, I looked in the mirror and
verified the so-called mark she mentioned.)"	
Message	None	"(On my neck was Kurumi's proof―a red hickey.
The mark of her kiss etched deeply into my skin.)"	
Message	None	"(It goes without saying that Kotori totally got me
later.)"
