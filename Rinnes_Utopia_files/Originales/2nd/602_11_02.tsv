Message	Shido	It's morning... Huh? When did I fall asleep?	
Message	Shido	"*yawn*... I don't remember falling asleep.
What was I up to? I can't seem to recall."	
Message	None	"(I gazed around my room, catching my eye
on the calendar. Then...)"	
Message	Shido	Ah. I see. It's my day off.	
Message	None	"(Today's my day off. And I promised to go
on a date with Origami.)"	
Message	None	"(We've once again confessed our feelings
to one another, and now we're officially
going out.)"	
Message	None	(Today will be our first date.)	
Message	Shido	A date with Origami... I feel nervous.	
Message	Shido	"But there's no point in stressing over it.
I'll just go."	
Message	Shido	"Okay. I still have time before we scheduled
to meet."	
Message	None	"(I'm about to go on an actual date with Origami.
I don't want to be late to our first date.)"	
Message	None	"(Origami is... Ah, there she is. I guess she's
already here.)"	
Message	Shido	Morning, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Shido, morning.	
Message	Shido	W-Was I keeping you?	
Message	Origami	Not at all. I just arrived.	
Message	Shido	...Somehow, I doubt that.	
Message	Origami	...How did you know?	
Message	Shido	"There's a feather in your hair. You didn't
put this there, did you?"	
Message	Origami	I was playing with pigeons. No big deal.	
Message	Shido	"Playing with pigeons. Man, I'm sorry.
I should've left home earlier."	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. Pigeons are cute.	
Message	Shido	I-I see, but you got bored, right?	
Message	Origami	There is no problem.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. If you say so...	
Message	Origami	Shido, where are we going today?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Hm...	
Message	None	"(I'm on my own for today's date. As Origami's
boyfriend, I have to take the lead in planning.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know if I'll be any good at it, but I
can do it.)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, why don't we head to a café so
we can talk it over? I'm thirsty."	
Message	None	"(Origami said it was no problem, but I bet
she's tired. So we need a place where we
can rest.)"	
Message	Origami	Got it.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Then let's go.	
Message	Origami	...Here?	
Message	Shido	Sure. Should we... find a seat in the back?	
Message	Origami	"That's no good. I want to be near the entrance.
As security in the worst-case scenario."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait, Origami... Who are you fighting
right now?"	
Message	None	"(Does she have to be on red alert even on
a date with me? Can she not relax around
me?)"	
Message	Origami	Do not fret. Force of habit.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... Well, we can sit wherever you want,
Origami. Looks like there's plenty of room."	
Message	Origami	Got it.	
Message	Shido	"Hm, drinks... I'm going to get coffee. What
about you?"	
Message	Origami	Same as what you're having.	
Message	Shido	"G-Gotcha. Then I'll order, okay? Excuse me.
Two coffees, please!"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...Urgh.	
Message	None	"(Crap. If this silence keeps up, it'll get
awkward. What do I do?)"	
Choice		Do some small talk.	
Choice		Distract yourself.	
Message	Shido	Do you visit cafés often, Origami?	
Message	Origami	Not particularly. I rarely go out alone.	
Message	Shido	I-I see.	
Message	Origami	What about you?	
Message	Shido	Well, I don't go out alone much either.	
Message	Origami	"But you checked your wallet earlier, Shido.
You had a coupon for this soup."	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	"(Oh, crap. I forgot. I usually come here for
private time. I must've gotten the coupon
a while ago.)"	
Message	None	"(Oof. If she noticed a coupon that I had
forgotten about, then Origami has a good
eye.)"	
Message	Origami	"When you say you do not often travel alone,
does that imply you come here with guests?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No. I mean, I come here with Kotori
sometimes. Just when we're out."	
Message	Origami	...I see.	
Message	None	"(I think I played it off. I mean, not that it
was a lie.)"	
Message	None	(Anyway, I need to change the subject.)	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Do you like eating foods you like
at the beginning of a meal, or do you
save the best parts for last?"	
Message	Origami	"I am ambivalent about food. I never think about
the order in which it is consumed. I consume a
well-balanced diet. The rest is habit."	
Message	Shido	"I see, but... Oh, I know. If you're dieting, I hear
it's best to eat veggies first, then move on to
the main dish."	
Message	Origami	"I maintain a careful caloric intake with
nutrient-dense foods, and I exercise enough
not to worry about a diet."	
Message	Shido	Oh. Right. You're, um, slim, aren't you?	
Message	Origami	"Are you pointing out that I lack a
typically-voluptuous, feminine body?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, no. That's not what I meant.	
Message	Origami	...I see.	
Message	None	"(Urgh. Not only is this awkward, but
this conversation got off on the wrong
foot.)"	
Message	Shido	I-I know, Origami.	
Message	Origami	What is it?	
Message	Shido	"I know. I think it is about time for my
points to recover."	
Message	Origami	...What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	"A game. A mobile game. You need points to
play, but they regenerate after a set amount
of time. I should have enough points now."	
Message	Origami	We are going to game here?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Do you not want to?	
Message	Origami	Do as you please, Shido.	
Message	Shido	I'll be done soon, so give me a second.	
Message	Origami	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	"...You see. They're currently doing an
event. It's hard to raise your affinity
stat."	
Message	Origami	Affinity?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You perform a date quest, gain affinity
points, and obtain a rare heroine card."	
Message	Origami	...I see.	
Message	Shido	"All right. I used 'em up. Guess I won't be able
to play again until tonight."	
Message	Origami	Shido, is that fun for you...?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, yes...	
Message	None	"(This is starting to feel like the wrong decision.
I ignored my date, and played a dating game
instead of talking to my DATE.)"	
Message	Origami	"Are you not enjoying yourself with me on
this date?"	
Message	Shido	"Agh. Well, no, that's not it. Um, it's to learn
how to date."	
Message	Origami	"Learn how to date...? Are you suggesting that
you gain information to use on an actual date?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Kinda. Just for reference, though.	
Message	Origami	...I see.	
Message	None	(Hm. I think I messed that one up.)	
Message	Origami	"So, where are we going next? We have yet
to decide our next move."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, huh? Uh...	
Message	Shido	I had the idea of watching a movie.	
Message	Origami	I do not mind.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Then let's head to the movie theater.	
Message	None	"(Origami doesn't look like she's enjoying
herself. I'll have to do better at the next
location.)"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...Origami.	
Message	Origami	"This theater has a sign that says they're
temporarily closed."	
Message	Shido	Sorry... I didn't check ahead of time.	
Message	None	"(I should've checked beforehand. I just kinda
assumed the movies would be open on my day
off. Of all the dumb luck...)"	
Message	Origami	"It's fine. It's not like there was a movie that I
wanted to watch."	
Message	Shido	I'm really sorry about this...	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. So, where to next?	
Message	Shido	Oh, um...	
Message	None	"(Shoot. I wasn't thinking. My mind was still
stuck on that total failure. I have no idea...)"	
Message	Origami	"If there is nothing in particular, I have an
idea."	
Message	Shido	Y-You want to go somewhere?	
Message	Origami	Follow me.	
Message	Shido	Oh, hey Origami.	
Message	Origami	...We're here.	
Message	Shido	Is this where you wanted to go?	
Message	Origami	The air is warm, and the breeze is nice.	
Message	Shido	You're right. It's been chilly lately.	
Message	None	"(A perfect Autumn day. Not too hot, not too
cold.)"	
Message	Shido	"What a view, huh? Does looking down at the
town like this relax you?"	
Message	Origami	It is quiet, giving us a moment to pause.	
Message	None	"(I see. Maybe Origami prefers quaint areas
like this instead of lively ones.)"	
Message	Origami	Can we stay here a while?	
Message	Shido	"Yes, of course. Do you like places like this,
Origami?"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?	
Message	Origami	...I do not like it in particular.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, really?	
Message	Origami	In truth, the location does not matter.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Is it because of the nice weather that
you preferred being outside instead of indoors?
Or was it the quiet?"	
Message	Origami	No. What matters is that I am with you.	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Origami	"No matter where I am, so long as you are with
me, I enjoy it. The place is irrelevant."	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	"But...there is a reason I chose this place. Here,
I can look at you and take my time."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Well, I guess there aren't nearly as many
people here as in the café, so we can chat,
right?"	
Message	Origami	And we can do more than that.	
Message	Shido	Origami, this is still a public place.	
Message	Origami	Then, shall we sit on a bench?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sure.	
Message	Origami	"If you want, you can place your head on my
lap."	
Message	Shido	"No, there are other people around... Let's
sit normally, okay..."	
Message	Origami	...Okay.	
Message	None	"(We were at Takadai Park and chatted,
enjoying one another's company.)"	
Message	None	"(Although I wanted to take Origami somewhere,
it seems more like she's taking me instead.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, maybe I can suggest something she
will enjoy.)"	
Message	Shido	"Do you want to drop by the arcade on our
way back, Origami?"	
Message	Origami	I do not mind.	
Message	Shido	Let's go then.	
Message	Shido	All right. This one...	
Message	Origami	A crane game...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I'm pretty good at these. Since we're on
a date, I thought I could win you something."	
Message	Origami	A gift from Shido... How nice.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Anything catch your eye, Origami? I'll
get whatever you want."	
Message	Origami	"...I don't mind what it is. As long as it comes
from you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Okay. I'll get the biggest one. Hehehe.
Watch this..."	
Message	Shido	...Huh? Weird.	
Message	Shido	One more time...	
Message	Shido	Argh! So close. O-One more time...	
Message	Shido	Almost there! One more time.	
Message	Origami	Shido... Might it be the key holder there?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Okay, this is the one!	
Message	Shido	...Hehe.	
Message	Origami	...Shido?	
Message	Shido	Origami, I did it... I finished!	
Message	None	"(After using countless coins, I gave up and
aimed for a small key holder, trying so many
times to capture it.)"	
Message	None	"(It was a pathetic showing for one key holder,
but then a miracle happened...)"	
Message	Shido	"(It was a double! I didn't think I'd catch the
one beside it...!)"	
Message	None	"(Two key holders fell. All thanks to Origami,
who pointed out the one in the middle.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Origami. It's not the one I aimed for.	
Message	Origami	I'm happy. You tried for my sake.	
Message	Shido	Haha... You're making me blush.	
Message	Origami	But... I don't need two.	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Origami	I want you to keep the other one.	
Message	Shido	Oh, got it. I'll put it on my bag.	
Message	Origami	I'll put it in the same place. We're matching.	
Message	Shido	We are.	
Message	None	(Finally, we were on our way back.)	
Message	None	"(Origami was her usual self, walking beside
me with a stoic expression.)"	
Message	None	"(Both of us were quiet. Silence makes me
nervous. Origami didn't look upset, but
I can't tell if she's having a good time.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if I'm doing this right. But I can't
think in those terms. I mean, I hardly did a
thing right today. I wonder if she had fun.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami...?	
Message	Origami	What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Um, sorry about today. You didn't have much
fun, did you?"	
Message	Origami	...Why do you say that?	
Message	Shido	Well, you didn't look like you enjoyed yourself.	
Message	Shido	"I... I'm not used to dates. So I wasn't sure if I
was doing a good job or not."	
Message	Shido	"So, um, sorry for dragging you around on your
day off."	
Message	Origami	I don't know what you're talking about.	
Message	Shido	Well, you see...	
Message	Origami	Shido, come here...	
Message	Shido	...What is it?	
Message	Origami	Just do it.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Like this?	
Message	Origami	Give me your hand.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?!	
Message	None	"(Origami took my hand and placed it against
her chest, a very soft place... so that I could
feel her heartbeat.)"	
Message	Shido	What... are you doing?!	
Message	Origami	Shido, there is nothing for you to worry about.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Can't you tell? My heart is racing right now.	
Message	Shido	Is it... because you're nervous?	
Message	Origami	"That's right. Just being with you makes my
heart pound."	
Message	Shido	I-I see, but still...	
Message	Origami	"I want you to feel it. Just being with you
is enough to put me in this state, Shido."	
Message	Origami	"I may not express it with my words, my
expressions, or my emotions, but this
is proof enough. Shido, can you trust me?"	
Message	Shido	Well, um, I don't know if this is okay...	
Message	None	"(Her clothes felt nice, and I could feel her
warmth. She was so soft that I thought I would
melt any moment.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, can you tell?	
Message	None	"(The bump I felt beneath my hand slowly
bobbed up and down in sync with her
breathing.)"	
Message	Origami	Can you feel how quickly my heart is beating?	
Message	Shido	I-I know... I know...	
Message	None	"(I'm the one whose heart is about to pound
real fast. I could feel my blush reach the tops
of my ears.)"	
Message	None	"(Actually, before I noticed Origami's heartbeat,
I was disoriented by the loudness of my own.)"	
Message	None	(What should I do...?)	
Choice		Stay like this.	
Choice		Remove my hand.	
Message	Shido	Uh, um, is it okay to stay like this for a bit?	
Message	Origami	I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay...	
Message	None	(What am I even saying?! That's crazy!)	
Message	Origami	You can grab harder.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh...	
Message	None	"(Origami grabbed my hand, and pressed it
into her body.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, your hand is... very hot.	
Message	Shido	W-Well, I can explain...	
Message	None	"(I thought I would melt at any moment from
how soft she felt. I felt an electric hum travel
through my body.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, touch me more...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, n-no, we can't... We can't do this...!	
Message	None	"(It's like I'm absorbing Origami's heat.
I became dizzy, like I was on the cusp of
overheating.)"	
Message	None	"(I couldn't take anymore. I pulled my hand
away from Origami.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	I-I got it... I really get it now.	
Message	Shido	"But Origami, we can't do this here. What
would you do if someone saw?"	
Message	Origami	I do not mind...	
Message	Shido	Well, I do! Besides...	
Message	None	"(Besides, the marshmallow-like feeling, the
sweet, sugary warmth.... is almost too much
to bear.)"	
Message	Shido	A-Anyway, I don't think this is appropriate!	
Message	Origami	Oh...	
Message	None	(I withdrew my hand from Origami.)	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Origami. This is too much for me.	
Message	Origami	"I am your girlfriend, Shido. You do not have
to hesitate."	
Message	Shido	I know that, but I don't think it's appropriate.	
Message	Origami	"Why? Don't you like me? Do you not wish
to go out with me?"	
Message	Shido	That's not it... That's not it, Origami.	
Message	Origami	"Then, why do you have a problem with
touching me...?"	
Message	Shido	B-Because it feels wrong.	
Message	Origami	"Then, why? I want you to know more about
me. I want you to get closer... and feel me."	
Message	Shido	"I-I don't know how to explain it, but... I don't
think this is appropriate."	
Message	Origami	Appropriate? Do you not wish to touch me?	
Message	Shido	No, no. That's not what I'm saying.	
Message	Origami	"Why not then? If it is you, I do not mind where
you touch me or what you do to me."	
Message	Origami	"I find myself always wanting to touch your
body. I want to feel every part of you."	
Message	Origami	Do you not feel the same...?	
Message	Shido	I-I do, but still... It's not right.	
Message	Origami	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"You're precious to me, Origami. Because of that,
I don't want to rush into anything."	
Message	Shido	"It's hard to explain, but I feel like touching
you here out of the blue just feels wrong."	
Message	Origami	So what are you saying?	
Message	Shido	Well...	
Message	Origami	Does forbidden temptation excite you?	
Message	Shido	NO! NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST!	
Message	Origami	"Then, you refuse to let me stimulate you?
Do I not qualify as your girlfriend?"	
Message	Shido	"No, it's the opposite. I don't like the thought
of looking at you in a perverted way."	
Message	Shido	"It's hard to explain, but I don't want you to
feel like I'm only seeing you for the purpose
of expecting something in return."	
Message	Origami	"But I do not mind. It is normal for a man
of your age. If it is coming from you Shido,
it makes me happy."	
Message	Shido	"I might sound selfish, but I'm serious...
I want to see you in a more serious way.
I want to hold onto what we have."	
Message	Origami	...Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Or else, I feel like my feelings for you won't
be real. The thought scares me. I don't want
to rush anything. For now, at least..."	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Shido	Is that a problem for you?	
Message	Origami	I understand what you mean. I agree.	
Message	Shido	I-I'm glad. Do you understand?	
Message	Origami	"Basically, you want no one to see what we do.
Not in a random street. But if we are alone in a
closed room, you want to play with me, yes?"	
Message	Shido	NO! Let's dial it back a bit!	
Message	Origami	...I am joking. I understand.	
Message	Shido	Are you sure...?	
Message	None	(For some reason I do not trust her...)	
Message	Origami	Your sense of virtue is solid.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah...? Seems like if we added ourselves
together and divided the results in half,
we'd be perfect."	
Message	Origami	That may be true.	
Message	Shido	"Anyway, I want to respect you... That's what I
had wanted to say."	
Message	Origami	"That is sweet of you to say. I will try my best
to abide by your request."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. I've had a lot of fun, so why don't we
call it a day?"	
Message	Origami	...Understood. Let's leave it here for today.	
Message	Shido	...Right. Let me walk you.	
Message	Origami	"I'm fine. I don't need it. Your home and mine
are in the opposite directions. It is a waste of
your time."	
Message	Shido	No, but...	
Message	Origami	No problem. I will see you tomorrow.	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay. Tomorrow.	
Message	None	"(Is she sure she doesn't want me to escort
her?)"	
Message	None	"(As I posed the question to myself, Origami
took one step, then turned around to face me.)"	
Message	Origami	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	What is it...?	
Message	Origami	"Do not forget one thing. So long as we are
together, that is all that matters."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I got that. Understood.	
Message	Origami	That is all. Good night.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Origami	Good-bye, Shido.	
Message	Shido	L-Later, Origami.	
Message	None	"(It was our first date since we became official.
Was that okay...? As soon I was alone, I became
incredibly anxious.)"	
Message	None	"(Am I kind enough to Origami? Is she having a
good time? Is she feeling anxious, too? Am I
really worthy of her love...?)"	
Message	Shido	Hehe... Hahaha...	
Message	None	"(But soon, it all felt so silly. I really like
Origami. I'm crazy about her.)"	
Message	None	"(I need to communicate those feelings more.
We just parted ways, but I already want to
see her again.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm going to do better on our next date.
That's what I told myself.)"
