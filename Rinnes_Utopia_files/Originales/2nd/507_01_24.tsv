Message	None	(....)	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Did I fall asleep?	
Message	None	(When did that happen?)	
Message	None	(Man, it's already dark out!)	
Message	None	"(It's not like I had much planned for my day off
today, but this is bad... I wonder why I fell asleep.)"	
Message	None	(I have to hurry downstairs and prepare dinner.)	
Message	None	(Huh...?)	
Message	None	(I hear something in the kitchen. Someone's here.)	
Message	None	(Who could it be? Don't tell me Kotori is cooking.)	
Message	Miku	Oh, you've finally come down!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?!	
Message	None	(The pretty girl in the kitchen... Who is she?)	
Message	None	"(She seems familiar... but my head... It feels so
hazy.)"	
Message	None	(Ugh...! I can't remember who she is.)	
Message	Shido	Um. I'm sorry, who are you again?	
Message	Miku	"You meanie, darling. Have you forgotten your fiancée's
 name?!"	
Message	Shido	Darling?! Fiancée?!	
Message	Miku	Well, I don't blame you. It is our first time meeting.	
Message	Shido	"First time meeting... No wonder I don't recognize
you... But what do you mean by fiancée?"	
Message	None	"(What's going on... Do I have the definition wrong?
What else could fiancée be...? A food? Can't be...)"	
Message	Miku	"Don't you mind the details～ My name is Miku Izayoi.
I may not be much, but it's a pleasure to meet you,
darling."	
Message	None	"(The girl bowed, but... Honestly I don't understand
this situation.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait?! What are you talking about?! Did you get
the wrong address or something?"	
Message	Miku	"There is no way I'd get you wrong, darling. I mean,
you're my husband! It's been decided since childhood!"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?!	
Message	None	"(What's with this sudden turn of events? Am I still in
a daze? No, that can't be. Calm down.)"	
Message	Kotori	What's all the ruckus for, Shido?	
Message	None	(And there came...)	
Message	Shido	"Kotori! Perfect timing. Listen to me. This girl's
claiming to be my fiancée and..."	
Message	Kotori	"So what? I'm sorry, onee-chan. The guy's brain is
pathetic."	
Message	Miku	"*Giggle*... That's not true, Kotori-chan. Darling is
so wonderfully funny!"	
Message	Shido	What...?! You already know Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	"What are you talking about? Of course I know her.
She's your fiancée, Shido. I'm family. There's no way
I wouldn't know her."	
Message	Shido	"Fiancée... I mean fiancée?! You're talking about THAT
kind of fiancée, right?!"	
Message	Kotori	"Yes, THAT fiancée. What's wrong with you? Did you
hit your head or something?"	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it, but... Let me check one more time.
This Miku girl is my..."	
Message	Miku	Yes ♪ Your future wife, darling～	
Message	Shido	What... I have a fiancée?! When was that decided?!	
Message	Kotori	"From when onee-chan was born. A year before you
were born, Shido."	
Message	Kotori	"Our parents were friends with her parents and said
if they ever had a boy it would be wonderful. And
that's how it was set."	
Message	Shido	That's so messed up! No one told me about it.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh really? Maybe it's because your brains are the
size of a Philodina that you just don't remember.
Case in point, I knew about it. Explain that."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. If I had a fiancée, I'm sure I'd
remember."	
Message	Kotori	Oh really? Then maybe they forgot to tell you.	
Message	Shido	"Don't just play it off. I just found out I have a
fiancée, of course I'd be surprised! If you had told
me, at least..."	
Message	Miku	"When I first found out, I was surprised too～
Anyone would be surprised, huh～
To suddenly have a fiancé."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that's totally normal.	
Message	Miku	"But as soon as I saw your photo, I immediately
thought... Ah, so this man is going to be my husband."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, totally... huh? Wait. Who thinks that way?	
Message	Miku	"Ever since then, I've spent my time thinking about
you."	
Message	Shido	"I-I can't tell if I should be happy. It's hard to
understand."	
Message	Miku	So, um... I was really excited to meet you today.	
Message	Shido	W-Well, that's nice. Thanks.	
Message	Miku	Okay. Um... Nice to meet you.	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. I understand the situation now, but still...
Honestly, it still hasn't sunk in. And it's all been
decided without my feelings being considered."	
Message	Kotori	What's your problem, Shido? Are you not satisfied?	
Message	Miku	You... don't like me?	
Message	Shido	W-Well... *grunt*	
Message	Shido	I don't... hate you, but...	
Message	Shido	"I just can't believe it. How I could have a fiancée
that's so..."	
Message	None	(So... cute...)	
Message	Kotori	...Why are you looking at her all pervertedly, Shido?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm not looking at her like that!	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways, you seem to be happy. Then take care of
her, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"B-But... We don't know anything about each other.
Do you... um... Are you really okay with that,
Miku...san?"	
Message	Miku	"Yes... I grew up thinking about you. Even today, I
wanted to see you so badly, I begged to come over
here."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... Um, sorry. I just found out about this, so
there's this difference in feelings..."	
Message	Miku	"Don't worry～ We can begin to get to know each other
now."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. I mean, that's why she came to visit.	
Message	Shido	"Well... I've never even thought about marriage. So I
just wasn't ready."	
Message	Kotori	I'm sure there's a lot to worry about.	
Message	Shido	Right?	
Message	Kotori	"That's why to get used to it, she's going to live with
us starting today."	
Message	Shido	"What?! Starting today?! That's too soon! I mean,
shouldn't it just be a quick meet-and-greet? Now
we're just going to start living together?!"	
Message	Kotori	"The sooner the better for situations like these. Now
stop your complaining and let's eat dinner."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... You're right, it was dinnertime. That's why I
came down..."	
Message	Kotori	"Well be thankful, Shido. Onee-chan has already prepared
dinner for today."	
Message	Miku	"I don't know if it's any good, but... I tried my
best, so I hope you like it, darling."	
Message	Shido	But this is take-out sushi!	
Message	Miku	I did my best to line the plates.	
Message	Kotori	Let's just eat. We'll have plenty of time to talk.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Well, I guess we'll do that.	
Message	None	"(And so... I am eating dinner with my fiancée, who
visited me out of the blue, but...)"	
Message	Kotori	It's been a while since I've had sushi.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, I know.	
Message	Miku	"This is delicious～ Oh, darling, do you have enough
soy sauce?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, th-thanks.	
Message	None	(Dinner is progressing in a civil way, but...)	
Message	None	(What do I do?)	
Message	None	(I have to talk about something.)	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Miku-san?	
Message	Miku	Aww, darling. Please just call me Miku.	
Message	Shido	"What?! Can't I call you Miku-san until I get used to
it?"	
Message	Miku	No～ Darling, you will call me Miku. It's decided～!	
Message	None	(Huh? It is? *groan*... I'm just so embarrassed...)	
Message	Shido	Ahem... Th-Then, M-Miku...	
Message	Miku	Yes, darling.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are your hobbies?	
Message	None	"(Is this an arranged marriage?! I mean, I know,
but...!)"	
Message	Miku	"Hobbies? Oh, I like to sing～ That's what I like the
most～!"	
Message	Shido	"Singing, huh? Miku, your voice is pretty, so it suits
you. I can actually picture you singing."	
Message	Miku	Really～? Ah, so happy!	
Message	None	(I'm so glad. We're having conversation...)	
Message	Kotori	"At this rate, don't you think you two'll work out?
You guys are good together."	
Message	Shido	Well, um... I don't really understand it all, but...	
Message	Miku	Kotori-chan. Thank you～	
Message	Kotori	"So Shido, what do you say? This kind of life will be
yours from now on. Aren't you happy?"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... It's not like I'm not happy, but... I'm still
confused."	
Message	None	"(I was surprised to suddenly hear about this
engagement, but she's not a bad girl.)"	
Message	None	(And she's cute when she smiles. She's like an idol.)	
Message	None	"(But even so, to just be told that she's my fiancée.
It's embarrassing... I feel like I can't let my guard
down.)"	
Message	None	(I'm totally not ready mentally...)	
Message	Miku	"Darling! I'll try my best to have you like me. It'll
be my pleasure."	
Message	Shido	"Ngh... Um... Right back at you. I have no confidence
that I'll be the kind of man you want..."	
Message	Miku	"It'll be fine～ You're a wonderful person, darling.
There's no way I'd hate you!"	
Message	Shido	"What is your basis in thinking that...? Well, I guess
it's better than you hating me."	
Message	None	"(And so my life with my fiancée began... What's going
to happen next?)"	
Message	None	(Phew. Man, today was surprising.)	
Message	None	(To have your fiancée visit out of the blue.)	
Message	None	"(I was so nervous that I exhausted myself. I'm going
to sleep.)"	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	None	(Hm? Did someone knock on the door?)	
Message	None	(Who could it be? Don't tell me it's...)	
Message	Shido	Whoa, Miku.	
Message	Miku	Sorry, darling. Were you sleeping already?	
Message	Shido	No, it's fine. What's the matter?	
Message	Miku	U-Um... I wanted to um...	
Message	Shido	"What is it? Did you need something? Or are you feeing
sick?"	
Message	Miku	It's not that. Um.... I have a favor to ask of you.	
Message	Shido	A favor?	
Message	Miku	Yes. U-Um... I want to...	
Message	Miku	Sleep with you.	
Message	Shido	With me...	
Message	None	(*Gulp*...)	
Message	None	"(To sleep with me means... that... right? Like we'd
be in the bed sleeping...)"	
Message	None	(Wh-what do I do?)	
Choice		Yes.	
Choice		No.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, let's sleep together.	
Message	Miku	O-Okay... I'm so glad. I... couldn't sleep.	
Message	Shido	Th-Then... Um. G-Go on ahead.	
Message	Miku	Okay. I-I'm coming in.	
Message	None	"(I could sense Miku meekly stepping in through the
doorway.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm doing my best to look up at the ceiling and not
directly at her, but... we're in the same bed right
now. I can feel it.)"	
Message	None	(It's warm and soft.)	
Message	None	(Sleeping... Miku is sleeping next to me...)	
Message	Miku	Um... darling.	
Message	None	(*Grunt*... She's talking right next to my ear...)	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah?	
Message	Miku	Good night.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Good night.	
Message	None	(I don't think I can sleep...)	
Message	None	(And so I ended up not being able to sleep.)	
Message	Shido	N-No, that's inappropriate...	
Message	Miku	B-but... I can't sleep on my own.	
Message	Shido	"Th-Then how about this? Let's talk in the living room
until you get sleepy. We'll keep the room bright."	
Message	Miku	Then... wouldn't you be sleepy, darling?	
Message	Shido	"If we were under the covers together, that'd be
more of a reason to not sl... I mean, I-I'm fine.
I kind of slept in today, so I can't sleep either."	
Message	Miku	Um... Sorry.	
Message	Shido	"It's fine. Miku, you're not used to this house so I
can see why you can't sleep. Let's go."	
Message	Miku	Okay thank you～ Darling, I'm so happy...	
Message	None	(We ended up talking all night.)
