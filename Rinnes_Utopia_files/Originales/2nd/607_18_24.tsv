Message	None	"(Some time has passed since Miku and I started
dating. Miku's been skillfully balancing her work
and school.)"	
Message	None	"(In fact, strangely enough, ever since we started
dating, she's only shined brighter. Sure, I might
be biased, but it's undeniable.)"	
Message	None	"(Even so, it's still a grueling schedule.
Thinking that she needed a well-deserved break,
Miku and I decided to have a park date.)"	
Message	Miku	"Darling, hurry hurry～
Over here～"	
Message	Shido	"You're so spry, even though it's been a while
since you've had a day off."	
Message	Miku	"Well, today's the day I can see you, after all.
All of my exhaustion just disappears."	
Message	None	"(As Miku says this, she takes my hand. Lately,
we've been less shy about holding hands, too.
We're finally progressing as a couple.)"	
Message	None	"(There was still so much we had to learn
about one another, but with time, we'd be
able to fill in the blanks bit by bit.)"	
Message	Shido	"I feel like I've done a lot of embarrassing
stuff, but if I want her to know the real me,
I guess that's all part of it..."	
Message	Miku	"What's the matter, darling? You're spacing
out again. Is something wrong? Or has
something good happened...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, we've been dating for a while now, right?
I was just thinking... that we're starting to
act more like a couple."	
Message	Miku	"You're right. I've gotten to know who you are,
darling. So I think it's helped me be a better
girlfriend than before, too."	
Message	Shido	I've learned a lot about you too, Miku.	
Message	Miku	"Eeheehee. Hey, darling? Is it okay for me to be
to your girlfriend for a while?"	
Message	Shido	"Of course that's okay. You'll always be my
girlfriend, Miku."	
Message	None	"(Well, I guess that means Miku's going to be
leading me around for a while.)"	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee hee. Happy to hear it. I want to know
everything there is to know about you."	
Message	Shido	"Of course, but there's so much I want to learn
about you too, Miku. Otherwise, it isn't fair,
right?"	
Message	Miku	Aww. About me, too?	
Message	Shido	"What do you mean? Of course. Come on,
I'll only be falling deeper and deeper in
love with you, Miku."	
Message	Miku	"Now what are you saying, darling?! I'm the
one who's fallen deeper and deeper in love
with you!"	
Message	Shido	Don't get me wrong... Is this a competition?	
Message	Miku	It is! Hmph!	
Message	None	"(We're both pretty straightforward. Thinking
about it like this is pretty funny.)"	
Message	Shido	Pff... Haha, hahaha!	
Message	Miku	Hee hee... Hehehe!	
Message	Shido	We're pretty similar, aren't we?	
Message	Miku	Yes! One in the same.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I know. I thought of something. Miku,
could I ask you a favor?"	
Message	Miku	"A favor for you, darling?
"	
Message	Miku	"Hmm, I suppose it can't be helped. I'll do you
any favor whenever you ask, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Any favor, huh? I got a good one.	
Message	None	(So, if you asked what happened next...)	
Message	Miku	D-D-D-darling...? Th-This is... a bit unorthodox.	
Message	Shido	"I've been thinking about how I want to see
you sing and dance up close."	
Message	Miku	"If that's what you want, then you can attend
one of my events or live concerts—"	
Message	Shido	But you don't have one soon, right?	
Message	Miku	"That's true, but I don't feel like there's
any need to watch this footage..."	
Message	Shido	Come on, Miku. Once more, with feeling!	
Message	Miku	"Oh goodness, darling! You'll pay for this
later!"	
Message	Shido	Could it be that you're a little embarrassed?	
Message	Miku	Not just a little. This is very embarrassing!	
Message	Shido	"Why? You're always standing on stage in
front of your fans."	
Message	Miku	"That might be true, but... I feel as though
I'm laying myself bare to you, darling."	
Message	None	"(I mean, I get it. It could be that performing
is just work, and she keeps her private life
separate.)"	
Message	Shido	"We've taken a bath together once, so there's
no reason to be embarrassed now."	
Message	Miku	"Ooogh, that's true, but we're talking about
two completely different circumstances."	
Message	Shido	"Come on, now. Keep dancing. In the video,
you're all smiles, Miku!"	
Message	Miku	"Goodness. You're such a meanie, darling. Aren't
you getting a little carried away?"	
Message	Shido	"Once in a while is fine, right?
Come on Miku, smile!"	
Message	Miku	Good grief.	
Message	Shido	Haha. You're totally blushing.	
Message	Miku	"You're being a meanie, darling. If you get too
carried away, I'll get angry!"	
Message	Shido	"Getting angry is fine. Doesn't matter if you're
embarrassed, angry, crying, or laughing...
I'll still love you!"	
Message	Miku	"Darling!
...Me too, darling. I'll always love you."
