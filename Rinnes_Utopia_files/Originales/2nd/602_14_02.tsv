Message	None	"(That day, Origami and I went to see a movie
that was playing in town.)"	
Message	None	"(I realized there was a definite change after
watching the movie.)"	
Message	Shido	"I had never heard of that movie before,
but I actually enjoyed it."	
Message	Origami	"Agreed. I liked the part where everyone started
dancing by the pool after the main character
was asked out."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really? I thought the whole revenge sub-plot
was the best. My hands got all sweaty."	
Message	Origami	"This movie was a hit. Shido, do we have any
plans after this?"	
Message	Shido	Hm. We can go to a café... Ah...	
Message	Shido	 AHCHOOO!	
Message	None	"(I let out a mighty sneeze. Even while I was
sitting in the theater, I felt a little chilly.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, are you okay?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm fine. Let's go, Origami.	
Message	None	(I didn't want to waste our time together.)	
Message	Origami	"Shido, are you a fan of action films? You mentioned
that your hands were sweaty during the climax."	
Message	None	"(Urgh... I'm getting the chills for sure. My nose
is starting to run, and my head's spinning.)"	
Message	Origami	...Shido, are you listening?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh, sorry. What'd you say?	
Message	Origami	Shido, I think you're getting sick.	
Message	Shido	N-No, I'm fine.	
Message	Origami	"You seem hotter than usual, and your heart
rate is rising too quickly."	
Message	Shido	Can you tell just by looking?	
Message	Origami	"Based on my observation, you are in the early
stages of a cold."	
Message	Shido	"I-I may be a little sick, but it's okay. It'll
wear off in no time."	
Message	Shido	Anyways, where should we go tomorrow?	
Message	None	"(I wanted nothing more than to be with Origami,
so I tried my best to ignore the symptoms.)"	
Message	Shido	ACHOO! *whimper*...	
Message	Origami	Shido, I think you are sick.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, you're probably right...	
Message	Origami	You should go home and rest at once.	
Message	Shido	Right. We have a date tomorrow, too.	
Message	None	"(We happened to schedule consecutive dates.
After all, I wanted to see Origami every day.)"	
Message	Origami	You do not have to force yourself.	
Message	Shido	It's fine. I can sleep it off.	
Message	Origami	"Are you sure you are all right? Shido, you have
a tendency of overdoing it."	
Message	Shido	I promise I'm fine. See you tomorrow, okay?	
Message	None	"(At the time, I didn't think I was pushing myself
too hard. I thought sleeping it off would help.)"	
Message	Origami	Okay, got it.	
Message	Shido	Later, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Good-bye. See you tomorrow.	
Message	None	(But that proved to be a costly mistake.)	
Message	Shido	Ugh...	
Message	None	(The next morning...)	
Message	Shido	M-My fever...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. Not only am I feeling no better, but I
feel even worse."	
Message	Shido	"I can't go on a date in this condition. My head
is splitting, and I'm so dizzy I can't get out of
bed."	
Message	Shido	Rgh... *cough*!	
Message	None	"(I have no choice but to cancel the date.
I feel terrible, but I need to call Origami
and apologize.)"	
Message	None	"(I crawled out of bed and sluggishly grabbed
my phone. My hand trembled as I selected
Origami in my contacts.)"	
Message	Origami	"Hello."	
Message	None	"(She picked up immediately, almost as if she
were waiting by the phone, expecting me.)"	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...	
Message	Origami	"What's the matter, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I have a fever, so I'm going to have
to cancel today's date. I'm so sorry..."	
Message	Origami	"...Understood."	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Origami. I know we made plans.	
Message	Origami	"Do not worry. Just rest."	
Message	Shido	Origami, are you somewhere outdoors?	
Message	Origami	"I am at our meeting place."	
Message	Shido	"What? But it's still morning. Did you leave
at dawn...?"	
Message	Origami	"It is not a problem. I woke early and was bored.\nI am heading over to your house at once."	
Message	Shido	My house...?	
Message	Origami	"I am going to take care of you."	
Message	Shido	"That's sweet of you, but you don't have to do
that."	
Message	Origami	"There is no problem. Caring after a boyfriend\nis the sworn duty of any worthwhile girlfriend."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami...	
Message	None	(Origami is coming over...)	
Message	None	"(I appreciate the sentiment since I feel lonely
when I'm sick, but...)"	
Message	Shido	"If Origami's coming over, I need to clean my
room."	
Message	None	"(U-Ugh... I can't. If I try standing, I feel
dizzy.)"	
Message	None	"(I guess I have no choice but to sleep and
wait for her.)"	
Message	None	"(I couldn't move, so I lay in bed, drifting
in and out of sleep.)"	
Message	Shido	*groan*...	
Message	None	(In my daze, I heard a knock on my door.)	
Message	Origami	Shido, may I come inside?	
Message	Shido	Origami...?	
Message	None	"(I sat up, all of a sudden feeling my headache
and dizziness evaporate.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, are you okay?	
Message	Shido	Sorry. My room's a mess, Origami.	
Message	Origami	"You are sick. You cannot help it. Do not worry.
For now, lie down."	
Message	Shido	Thanks... I'll do that.	
Message	None	"(My fever was high, and my joints were sore,
so I went back to bed.)"	
Message	Origami	Your temperature is getting higher, no?	
Message	None	"(Origami put down the plastic bag in her hand,
and took a seat on my bed. She placed her hand
on my forehead.)"	
Message	Origami	You're really hot...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I was hoping to sleep it off, but it won't
go down."	
Message	Origami	"I bought you medicine. I want you to take it
later."	
Message	Shido	Okay. Thanks.	
Message	Origami	Anyways, Shido...	
Message	Shido	What is it...?	
Message	Origami	"I think I know a way that could lower your
temperature."	
Message	Shido	"I have a bad feeling about it already, but go
ahead."	
Message	Origami	"They say that transferring your cold to someone
else will alleviate your symptoms. So if you give
it to me, you will feel better."	
Message	Origami	To be specific, through your mouth.	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Origami. I'm so sick that I can't even
react to your joke."	
Message	Origami	I'm serious.	
Message	Shido	"It'd be pointless for you to get sick, Origami.
I'm rejecting your idea."	
Message	Origami	"If the illness comes from you, it is practically
a gift."	
Message	Shido	Then we wouldn't be able to go on our date.	
Message	Origami	But then you would have to care for me.	
Message	Shido	Just... forget about it.	
Message	None	"(But I can sense the gears turning in Origami's head.
I'm covering myself with a blanket now.)"	
Message	Origami	You really don't want to give it to me?	
Message	Shido	I'm fine. Feeling better already.	
Message	None	"(She's inspecting my face. Maybe I can try
to distract her somehow...)"	
Choice		I'm hungry.	
Choice		My room is dirty.	
Choice		I'm forgetting something...	
Message	Shido	"I haven't eaten since this morning. Would you
mind finding me something to eat in the kitchen?
Can't take medicine with an empty tummy."	
Message	Origami	Then, I will prepare you something.	
Message	Shido	Y-You will?	
Message	Origami	I can prepare you some porridge. Do not worry.	
Message	Shido	"Er. Just please try not to slip anything in
there."	
Message	Origami	I shall not. Hang on.	
Message	Shido	C-Can I trust you?	
Message	Origami	Shido, it is done.	
Message	None	"(Origami brought me a tray with a bowl
and a glass.)"	
Message	Origami	Porridge and water for your medicine.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Thank you.	
Message	None	"(I sat up so she could place the tray on my
lap, and I checked the bowl of porridge.)"	
Message	Shido	Looks normal enough to me.	
Message	Origami	What are you afraid of?	
Message	Shido	Nothing. Guess I was overthinking it.	
Message	Origami	Now, go on. Eat.	
Message	Shido	Okay, will do.	
Message	Origami	"It was made fresh, so it is still hot.
Be careful."	
Message	None	"(I took the spoon and ate for the first time
all day.)"	
Message	Shido	"I-It is... hot. Normally I don't mind, but it
stings my sore throat."	
Message	Origami	Shido, I have a good idea.	
Message	Shido	"Agh... No, you don't have to feed me mouth to
mouth."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Why so quiet?	
Message	None	(Looks like I called it.)	
Message	Origami	It's fine. There is another way.	
Message	Shido	There is?	
Message	Origami	I'll blow on it.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Give me the spoon, Shido.	
Message	None	"(She snatched my spoon and scooped up a bit
of porridge, bringing it close to her mouth and
puckering her lips.)"	
Message	Origami	*blow, blow*...	
Message	Shido	Gotcha.	
Message	None	"(I think I misinterpreted her initially. Must
be the fever working.)"	
Message	Origami	Okay. Open your mouth.	
Message	None	(She fed the cooled porridge into my mouth.)	
Message	Shido	You're going to feed me?	
Message	Origami	It is more efficient that way.	
Message	Shido	I-I mean, sure...	
Message	None	"(I was feeling shy about the whole ordeal, but
at least this way, Origami wouldn't get sick.)"	
Message	Shido	A-Aaaah... *gulp*.	
Message	Origami	How is it? Still hot?	
Message	None	"(When cooled by Origami, the porridge was
the perfect temperature to swallow in one
gulp.)"	
Message	Shido	No, this is fine.	
Message	Origami	Then, let's continue. *blow*.	
Message	None	"(She cooled it once more, and carefully
directed the spoon into my mouth.)"	
Message	None	"(While at first it was slightly embarrassing,
it went on for a while longer.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I had hoped to clean my room before
you got here, but I didn't have enough time."	
Message	Origami	I can clean it for you.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, really? Thanks... I feel like I'm making
a maid out of you."	
Message	Origami	Do not worry. You are sick, so get your rest.	
Message	None	"(Origami stood up, and began picking up
around my room.)"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, are these clothes here your dirty
laundry?"	
Message	Shido	"No, those are washed. I was too lazy to
fold them yesterday."	
Message	Origami	Oh, then I will fold them.	
Message	None	"(Origami sat on the floor and began sorting
and folding my laundry on her lap.)"	
Message	None	(She looked so domestic and adorable.)	
Message	Shido	Origami, it almost seems like we're newlyweds.	
Message	Origami	"Of course. I am your future spouse. There
is no one else but me."	
Message	Shido	"...So, is my future wife rubbing my folded
laundry on her body?"	
Message	Origami	I'm putting my scent onto it.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	None	(Origami, as usual, made the task her own.)	
Message	Origami	Okay then.	
Message	Shido	"Wait, did you just sneak one of my shirts
into your bag? Make sure everything makes
it into my closet."	
Message	Origami	Well done, Shido. You have an eagle's eye.	
Message	None	(Man... That's Origami for you.)	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, I've got homework to
do. What should I do?"	
Message	Origami	Homework?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I just forgot to do it...	
Message	Origami	Then, I will do it for you.	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Origami	"If you wait for your fever to die down, there
is no telling when it will get done. Do not
prolong the task, or else I cannot see you later."	
Message	Shido	Well, I think I follow you, but...	
Message	Origami	"But I will do a preliminary draft of your
assignment. That way, you will have something
to turn in."	
Message	Shido	...Got it.	
Message	None	"(Origami took a seat at my desk and began
my homework.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	What's the matter, Origami?	
Message	Origami	"I may have to adjust my handwriting. Otherwise,
you will most certainly be caught."	
Message	Shido	"I think... if you can write like a guy, you'll be
fine."	
Message	Origami	Got it. I will try.	
Message	Shido	Awesome.	
Message	Origami	But, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	What's up, Origami?	
Message	Origami	"Is it okay for your answers to be identical
to mine?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's homework, so I'm sure it's expected.
I could say I used the textbook."	
Message	Origami	You have a point. Then I will continue.	
Message	Shido	Sounds good.	
Message	None	(Looks like I'm avoiding study hall.)	
Message	Origami	What shall we do after this...?	
Message	Shido	H-Hm... Rgh.	
Message	Origami	What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"I'm sweating a lot, which is giving me the
shivers. I want to change. Would you mind
getting me some clothes?"	
Message	Origami	"Got it. But if you sweat, then you will need
someone to wipe you."	
Message	Shido	Oh, right. Can you grab me a towel?	
Message	Origami	No need. I can wipe your sweat.	
Message	Shido	"What? It's fine. Just get me a towel and I
can do the rest myself."	
Message	Origami	No. You are sick. Be quiet and sit still.	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	None	"(Origami took out a towel and stood in front
of me.)"	
Message	Origami	Now, sit back and get comfortable.	
Message	None	"(W-Well, she's just doing me a favor.
I suppose I could let it happen.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, you have a nice body.	
Message	Shido	"Origami, if you keep staring, you'll make me
self-conscious. If you're going to wipe me, do
it quickly!"	
Message	Origami	*gulp*...	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	None	"(Origami's touch slightly tickled my body,
and I felt my muscles tighten.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, I...	
Message	None	(Origami got closer to my sweaty body.)	
Message	Origami	I... cannot restrain myself.	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, Origami... You're just wiping my body,
right?"	
Message	Origami	That's right. Whatever will put you at ease.	
Message	Origami	Mm...	
Message	None	"(Suddenly, she pressed her soft lips against my
body.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami, what are you doing? Are you―	
Message	None	"(It seemed Origami was licking me, and I felt
something warm and wet tickle my chest.)"	
Message	Origami	Mm, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Origami, you're not wiping me...	
Message	Origami	Shido, stay still... Mm...	
Message	Shido	Origami, stop...!	
Message	Origami	Mm... *pant*...	
Message	Origami	It is my duty to clean you.	
Message	None	(She looked at me as if she were in ecstasy.)	
Message	None	"(I was at a loss for words. The fatigue from
the sickness made it tough to push her off.)"	
Message	None	"(I let her do as she pleased, feeling myself
sweat with greater intensity.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, your body is warmer than usual.	
Message	Shido	Well, I do have a cold.	
Message	Origami	Perhaps that deserves more attention.	
Message	None	"(It made no sense, but Origami put her
lips against me once more.)"	
Message	None	"(It was like she was a beast, licking an old wound.
Every lick carried the weight of her undying
affection.)"	
Message	Origami	Mm... Mmmm....	
Message	None	"(It was almost endearing, though. Origami's
acts of affection made my heart melt a bit.)"	
Message	None	"(It was the effort she put in. So precious.
But... I still felt sick more than anything.)"	
Message	Origami	Ah, Shido...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...	
Message	None	(Oh, no. I felt ready to faint...)	
Message	Origami	Sh-Shido, are you okay?	
Message	Origami	Shido... Shido...	
Message	None	"(As I shut my eyes, I heard Origami's voice
fade into the distance.)"	
Message	None	"(But I was too weak to respond, and I slipped
away into the darkness.)"	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	None	(By the time I awoke, the sun had set.)	
Message	None	"(I sat up, rubbing my aching temples. My
fever seemed to have reduced, at least.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	None	(Origami was sitting next to me, concerned.)	
Message	Shido	Were you here... this whole time?	
Message	Origami	"Shido, forgive me. I should have been more
considerate."	
Message	Shido	"Have you been waiting all day? I'm sorry
for passing out."	
Message	Origami	"Not a problem. I would rather you do that
in order to get well."	
Message	Shido	Sure, thanks.	
Message	Origami	"No, I feel awful. Even when you were in pain,
I thought only of myself."	
Message	Origami	"I realize now, that I am always imposing
myself upon you."	
Message	Shido	"Can't argue there. Honestly, I'm not used
to how you behave yet, but I wouldn't say
you impose anything on me."	
Message	Origami	...Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. It's fine. I even like that part of you.	
Message	Shido	"So I want you to be yourself, Origami. I don't
mind if you act spoiled or forceful sometimes.
I accept you for who you are."	
Message	Shido	"Go on, bother me all you want. I like being
surprised, and―"	
Message	Shido	"I still want you to like me because... I like
you just as much."	
Message	Origami	Shido, I am so sorry, and―	
Message	Origami	"Thank you. Thank you for giving someone
like me your time."	
Message	Origami	"However, from now on, I will be more
considerate for your feelings."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, and I will also think more carefully
about what you want."	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Origami?	
Message	Origami	I love you.	
Message	Shido	I love you too.	
Message	Origami	Nothing can tear us apart.	
Message	Shido	"Of course. Let's see where this takes us.
As soon as I'm better, at least."	
Message	Origami	Okay.	
Message	None	"(Getting sick sucks, but at least it gave Origami
and me a chance to get even closer.)"
