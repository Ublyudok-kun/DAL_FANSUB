Message	Tohka	Mm! Fuh! Toh!	
Message	Shido	Oh, is that how it is? Then, take this!	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Not bad. But it's not over yet!	
Message	None	"(Tohka and I were going at it in the
living room.)"	
Message	None	"(Each of us was clutching a controller,
volleying back and forth on a digital
tennis court.)"	
Message	None	(We were in the middle of a heated match.)	
Message	Shido	"Don't underestimate me, Tohka! You're
getting good, but you won't beat me!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hehe. Then give me your all, Shido!
You are a worthy opponent, but I will
show you who is boss!"	
Message	None	"(The light rally continued. Even when I
performed an intense slice, Tohka had no
trouble returning. Argh... She's good.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Something the matter, Shido? Is that all
you got? Then, time to attack!"	
Message	Shido	Rgh... Where'd that come from?!	
Message	None	(It was my fault for being too defensive.)	
Message	Tohka	Now's my chance! Mine!	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	None	"(The timed, perfectly charged shot whizzed
mercilessly past my character and bounced
over the line.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka's character completed the set, and
the digital fanfare rang.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hehe. I win! 	
Message	Shido	I-I lost...?	
Message	None	"(I haven't played much lately, but Kotori
is the one who trained me.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hehehe... How's that, Shido? I am the victor.	
Message	None	"(Tohka was triumphant, wearing a bold
smirk. I only had one thing to say.)"	
Message	Shido	...You got me. You're the victor.	
Message	Tohka	"Hehehe. At last, I have gotten Shido to deem
me the victor."	
Message	Shido	This is the first time you've ever beaten me.	
Message	Tohka	"Pledging to overcome the challenge is
how this honor was won today!"	
Message	Shido	I... lost...	
Message	None	"(I fell to my knees. I have to face the facts.
Tohka's surpassed me...)"	
Message	Tohka	Then, as promised, you owe me one favor.	
Message	None	"(That's right. The loser had to owe whoever
won a favor. That was the deal.)"	
Message	None	(That's why we went all out...)	
Message	None	"(I just didn't think I'd lose, but I made
the promise. I have to go through with
it.)"	
Message	Shido	So, what do you want me to do?	
Message	Tohka	Hold on. Hmm.	
Message	None	"(Tohka put her finger to her lip and entered
deep thought.)"	
Message	None	"(Knowing Tohka, she won't say anything
like Kotori would. She'd probably ask me
to pay for dinner and call it a day.)"	
Message	None	"(Or rather, if it were Kotori, I wouldn't
have been so reckless as to bet on the
game.)"	
Message	None	"(It's the principle behind losing. I guess I
can spend a little money. So long as Tohka
doesn't suggest crab or uni, I'll be fine.)"	
Message	Shido	Man. You're improving as a gamer, Tohka.	
Message	None	"(I jumped on the sofa and dropped the
controller. Guess the match took it out
of me.)"	
Message	Tohka	I won't be my old self forever.	
Message	Tohka	"Gaming with you sure is fun, Shido.
It's easy to lose track of time."	
Message	None	(Tohka flashed a wide grin.)	
Message	None	"(Her carefree smile makes my heart skip beat.
Dating Tohka has led to many moments like this.
I realize now that simple things make me happy.)"	
Message	Tohka	"In any case Shido, are you expecting Kotori
soon? It is getting late."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. She said she's spending the night at her
friend's house tonight. She just messaged me."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, is that so?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, so she's not coming home.	
Message	None	"(When I answered her, Tohka started to
fidget.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka? What's the matter?	
Message	Tohka	"W-Well, then I am alone with you tonight,
am I?"	
Message	None	(When she pointed it out, I gasped.)	
Message	Shido	No! Um, well! Y-Yeah... I guess so.	
Message	None	(We're alone. I mean, she's right.)	
Message	None	"(But for her to point it out makes me aware
of it. We're healthy, a man and woman of age.)"	
Message	Tohka	Th-Then can I spend the night tonight?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, su... Hey... WHAT?!	
Message	None	(I couldn't help but scream.)	
Message	Shido	Oh, nonono! I don't think that’s...	
Message	None	(I turned to her, but I was stopped.)	
Message	None	"(Tohka blushed bright red, staring down
at me.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Y-You said you would owe me a favor. You
promised."	
Message	Shido	Well, I did, but this is sort of different!	
Message	Tohka	S-So... You refuse me, Shido?	
Message	Shido	...! I mean, not exactly―	
Message	None	"(Tohka put her hand over mine, eliciting
a gulp from me.)"	
Message	None	"(Her skin was unbelievably hot. I glanced up
at her, meeting her crystalline eyes.)"	
Message	Tohka	"You feel so lonesome by yourself, wouldn't
you Shido?"	
Message	Shido	U-Uh...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	"(Tohka said nothing, instead choosing to
wait for me to answer.)"	
Message	None	"(W-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to
calm down. Breathe in, breathe out.)"	
Message	None	"(Is this okay? I mean, Tohka's a girl. Not
to mention my girlfriend. But we've never
spent the night together before.)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, God. My head's starting to spin.
I don't even know what's happening.)"	
Message	None	"(If I think about it, I need to convince Tohka
and send her home. That's right. I should do
that.)"	
Message	None	(...But I couldn't bring myself to say it.)	
Message	Shido	"Okay, fine... You can spend the night.
We can make it an occasional thing."	
Message	Tohka	"...! Th-Thanks, Shido! Then I am going to
spend the night."	
Message	None	"(She seemed relieved, letting out a sigh.
My heart skipped a beat for the umpteenth time.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, uh...	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	(A heavy silence hung in the living room.)	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	"(We can't hold a simple conversation.
Rather, I couldn't make one happen.)"	
Message	None	"(The clock's tick was deafening. Normally
we could talk about anything.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka is sat beside me. Literally right next
to me. That alone made me speechless.)"	
Message	Shido	I-I'll get some juice!	
Message	Tohka	I-I'll get a drink!	
Message	None	"(We both not only blurted out at the same
time, but leapt up from the couch too.)"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Whoa!	
Message	Tohka	Aah!	
Message	None	"(We bumped into each other and toppled
over, landing on the sofa entwined.)"	
Message	Shido	Ah...	
Message	Tohka	Oh...	
Message	None	"(We could have separated immediately,
but we were so close. If our faces were
any closer, we could kiss...)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido...	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	None	"(Tohka's eyes widened, and I could see my
reflection in them. I can't look away. As if
my soul was being absorbed.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, um, your hand...	
Message	Shido	Hand?	
Message	Tohka	Hm...?	
Message	None	"(I moved my right hand, and Tohka jerked.
I realized I had been grabbing her chest.)"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry!	
Message	Tohka	Mm...	
Message	None	"(I hastily pulled my hand back, and Tohka
looked away.)"	
Message	None	"(But that was it. She neither screamed, nor
pushed me away, nor anything.)"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	"(Tohka was still blushing, moving only to
shake her head.)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	"(My heartbeat echoed like thunder inside
of my chest.)"	
Message	None	(Could Tohka hear it? It pounded furiously.)	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	None	"(Her pink lips uttered my name, the very
sound of which was so sweet, I felt numb.)"	
Choice		Approach her.	
Choice		Wait for her to say something.	
Message	Tohka	Aah!	
Message	None	"(I instinctively placed my hand on Tohka's
shoulder.)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido?	
Message	None	Tohka's breath tickled my nose.	
Message	None	"(Her soft, thin shoulders shook, and I became
insatiable when I took in her scent. It was
hard to explain.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, can I...?	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	(Tohka contemplated a bit, then nodded...)	
Message	Tohka	Shido, it's okay. I... want to do it too.	
Message	None	"(I can't take it anymore. My brain is mush.
My heart beat is going off louder than a
hammer against an anvil.)"	
Message	None	"(All I could see was Tohka. Her long lashes,
fine nose, and soft lips.)"	
Message	None	(The distance between us closed.)	
Message	Tohka	Ah...	
Message	Shido	Ah...?	
Message	Tohka	Ah...AAAA-CHOO!	
Message	Shido	Gya!	
Message	Tohka	Fugya!	
Message	None	"(It startled me so bad that I rolled off the
sofa.)"	
Message	Shido	NUOOO!	
Message	None	"(My nose slammed against her forehead.
It hurts soooo baaaad!)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido! Are you okay?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm fine!	
Message	None	(I was curled into a ball, but I answered.)	
Message	Tohka	B-But it was rather loud.	
Message	Shido	I'm okay. Look. My nose isn't bleeding, right?	
Message	Shido	Are you all right, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Yes. I was not hurt at all.	
Message	None	"(Tohka's forehead was a little rosy, but she
looked unharmed. What a relief.)"	
Message	None	(But that killed the mood...)	
Message	Tohka	My apologies...	
Message	Shido	It's okay. Don't sweat it.	
Message	None	(I comforted Tohka.)	
Message	Shido	Honestly, I'm more relieved than anything.	
Message	Tohka	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"It's hard to explain, but this is sort of what
makes us "us", you know?"	
Message	None	"(I think it's a sigh we don't have to rush
things. She and I can take our time.)"	
Message	None	(That puts me at ease.)	
Message	Shido	(Tohka...)	
Message	None	(Tohka was vulnerable, and I sat very still.)	
Message	None	(She whispered softly into my ear.)	
Message	Tohka	...If it's you Shido, I do not mind.	
Message	None	(Tohka then shut her eyes.)	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(My heart was pounding like a bell. It made
my head hurt. I couldn't hear a thing.)"	
Message	None	"(I can't tear my eyes off of Tohka. Her soft
lips were so inviting, so I got closer.)"	
Message	Tohka	Mm....	
Message	None	"I put my hand on her shoulder, and Tohka
let out a small sigh."	
Message	None	"(Her thin shoulders quivered. I felt goosebumps
form beneath my finger.)"	
Message	None	(Huh...? Goosebumps?)	
Message	Tohka	Ah...	
Message	Shido	Ah...?	
Message	Tohka	Ah...AAAA-CHOO!	
Message	Shido	Gya!	
Message	Tohka	Fugya!	
Message	None	"(It startled me so bad that I rolled off the
sofa.)"	
Message	Shido	NUOOO!	
Message	None	"(My nose slammed against her forehead.
It hurts soooo baaaad!)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido! Are you okay?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm fine!	
Message	Tohka	I see... Achoo!	
Message	Tohka	Ugh...	
Message	None	"(Tohka rubbed her arms and shivered. I heard
her sniffle. Wait, is she...?)"	
Message	Shido	Are you cold, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	...A bit.	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	None	"(We turned the heat up a little. When the
fan turned on, a warm breeze filtered into
the room.)"	
Message	None	(Tohka sighed from relief. I did the same.)	
Message	None	(I feel weak all of a sudden.)	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Tohka	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Our eyes locked. We both burst out in
laughter in unison.)"	
Message	Shido	Pfff...	
Message	Tohka	Hehe...	
Message	Shido	Ha... Ahahaha.	
Message	Tohka	AHAHAHA!	
Message	None	"(It was grave, but it was so silly, we couldn't
help but cackle.)"	
Message	Shido	Man, Tohka. You looked so serious.	
Message	Tohka	"Right back at you, Shido. Your nose was
flared."	
Message	None	"(We bickered at one another, then were
back to our normal selves.)"	
Message	Shido	"Tohka. I just remembered. I have some
cake still. Want some?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, a terrific idea! Let us enjoy it together.	
Message	Shido	"Okay. I'll put on some tea, so would you
mind clearing the table?"	
Message	Tohka	"Leave it to me! All for the sake of cake and
tea!"	
Message	None	"(Tohka's bright laugh filled the room.
It seemed impossible not to smile.)"	
Message	None	"(That's right. There's no need to rush it.
We always do things at our own pace.)"	
Message	Shido	You sure know how to sneeze, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shut up. It cannot be helped.	
Message	Tohka	You sneeze too, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I do, but are any of my sneezes as
memorable as that one?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, of course.	
Message	None	"(She fired back, but I was confused. Sorry,
Tohka. But I don't remember a thing.)"	
Message	None	(She pouted on the couch.)	
Message	Tohka	"Don't you remember? When you were picking
out my shoes and scarf."	
Message	Tohka	"You sneezed, mentioned you were cold, and
thus we embarked on the mission to purchase
winter attire."	
Message	Shido	"I don't think those sneezes were in the same
league, but I'm surprised you remembered,
Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	"I remember everything between us. They
are all precious memories. I do not want to
forget, nor do I wish to lose them. Is that odd?"	
Message	Shido	Not at all.	
Message	None	"(Her matter-of-fact tone was so direct,
it shocked me.)"	
Message	None	"(I mean, that was an ordinary day. I think
anyone else would've forgotten. So typical
it would've melted into any other day.)"	
Message	None	(But to Tohka, they were precious memories.)	
Message	Tohka	"These days are not so ordinary to me. It
was a gift from you to me. You taught me
how to date. You make every day fun for me."	
Message	Tohka	"I could never forget anything about you,
Shido."	
Message	Tohka	"So I want you to remember them, too.
If you do not, it would not be fair."	
Message	None	"(Tohka pointed at my nose. My eyes grew
round, drawing a laugh out of her.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Every day, there are no activities to do.
Only because you are at my side. Games,
karaoke, I can improve at them."	
Message	Shido	Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, I love you. I truly love you more than
anything. I really, really love you."	
Message	None	"(It was an honest confession. She spoke,
clear-eyed and plain.)"	
Message	None	"(Her words flowed naturally, and I let
them sink.)"	
Message	None	(Ah, I see. It's so simple.)	
Message	Shido	Me too, Tohka. I love you more.	
Message	None	"(I reciprocated, and confessed my honest
feelings.)"	
Message	None	"(Before, I was too embarrassed to say things
like this. I mean, I needed Kotori to trick me
into saying it before.)"	
Message	None	"(But no more. From here on, I would be
honest about my feelings, and say them
outright.)"	
Message	None	"(Because Tohka... is the most important woman
in the world to me.)"	
Message	Tohka	...Shido.	
Message	None	(Tohka smiled, but her voice trembled a bit.)	
Message	Tohka	"I have never been happier than in this moment.
Shido, my heart is overflowing from joy."	
Message	None	"(Thick tears dripped down Tohka's cheeks,
and I wiped them away gently.)"	
Message	Shido	I'll say it again. I love you, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Yes. I love you too, Shido.	
Message	None	"(We didn't have to say any more. Nothing
could split us apart.)"
