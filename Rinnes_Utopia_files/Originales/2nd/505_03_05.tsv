Message	Shiori	...Where am I?	
Message	Shiori	"I seem to be in the school hallway. But I think
it's after school already."	
Message	Shiori	Why am I here...?	
Message	Shiori	...Something feels totally off.	
Message	Shiori	"...I feel like I've been saying that a lot
recently."	
Message	None	"(While I was lost in thought, a nice breeze came
in through the window and rustled my skirt.)"	
Message	Shiori	"Yeah... That's right. I feel totally strange
wearing this uniform."	
Message	None	"(A girl passing by said hi to me. I think she said
"good day"... Should I respond the same way?)"	
Message	Shiori	Oh... uh, yeah. Good day. See you tomorrow.	
Message	Shiori	"...Hmm, there's nothing particularly off.
Come to think of it, I'm pretty accustomed
to this uniform."	
Message	Shiori	Oh... So this is my student ID.	
Message	None	...2-4 Shiori Itsuka.	
Message	Shiori	So I guess there's nothing really "off"...	
Message	Shiori	"Hm...? Wait, there's a note at the end of my ID.
It seems to be a reminder of my plans with
someone for today's date."	
Message	None	"Meet at onee-sama's classroom after school."	
Message	Shiori	"It's after school, right? Wait, I have an older
sister?"	
Message	Shiori	Whoa. What is it?	
Message	Shiori	"I see a crowd of people over there.
What's going on?"	
Message	Kotori	"Excuse me, can you let me through? I'm just here
to see my little sister."	
Message	None	"(She's coming this way. Which little sister is she
talking about?)"	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, there you are.	
Message	Kotori	"I told you I'd be waiting for you at the
classroom, but you never came. Gosh,
I was wondering where you were."	
Message	Shiori	Huh...? Are you talking about me?	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. Obviously. What's the matter, Shiori? You're
acting strange."	
Message	Shiori	Um, Kotori... Senpai?	
Message	Kotori	Yes, I'm your older sister, Kotori Itsuka.	
Message	Shiori	U-um... Older sister...?	
Message	Kotori	"Yes, that's right. I'll forgive you for forgetting
our plans. Now let's go."	
Message	Shiori	Huh. Wait a minute. I still can't grasp... Oh. Oh.	
Message	Kotori	Everyone, good day.	
Message	Kotori	"Phew. It's hard being popular, huh? It's all your fault,
Shiori. I came to pick you up..."	
Message	Shiori	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"I didn't want to make a scene, that's why I told you to
come to me after class."	
Message	Shiori	...	
Message	Kotori	Hey... are you listening, Shiori?	
Message	Shiori	I-I'm sorry. I still can't grasp the situation.	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. Just calm down. I'm not going anywhere,
Shiori."	
Message	Shiori	Okay. Um... Kotori-senpai, you're my sister, right?	
Message	Kotori	"Hehe. That's right. What's gotten into you? I'm your
step-sister, remember? Did you forget?"	
Message	Shiori	That's not it, exactly...	
Message	Kotori	"I see... Then I think it's appropriate that you call
me Senpai at school. But when we're alone, call me
onee-sama."	
Message	Kotori	You're my little sister.	
Message	Shiori	O-Okay... onee-sama.	
Message	Kotori	Good.	
Message	Kotori	Now come. This way.	
Message	Shiori	"Um, onee-sama? What did we have to do today?
Why did you call me to your class?"	
Message	Kotori	Do I need a reason to call for you?	
Message	Kotori	"I just wanted to spend some alone time with you,
Shiori. Is that not okay?"	
Message	Shiori	Huh? Um, uh...	
Message	None	"(Kotori onee-sama's hand softly grazed my cheeks.
It tickled but felt nice.)"	
Message	Shiori	Um, I think it's totally fine, onee-sama.	
Message	Kotori	Good. That's my adorable little Shiori.	
Message	None	"(I wonder why... This isn't the Kotori I know. She
seems calmer than usual, but she also looks like a
pet with a toy in front of her...)"	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter, Shiori? Why are you standing so
far away?"	
Message	Shiori	I-It's just, someone might be watching.	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. No one's watching. I'm sure God will turn
the other way, too."	
Message	Kotori	"Besides, we're sisters. Is it so weird to be doing
this?"	
Message	Shiori	Well...	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. We're not blood-related. I want to feel you
closer to me. Now, come closer Shiori."	
Message	Shiori	Okay, onee-sama.	
Message	None	"(I wonder why. The way Kotori's approaching me feels
a bit corrupt...)"	
Choice		It made me want to bully her a little.	
Choice		It made me want to fawn over her.	
Message	Shiori	Um, onee-sama...	
Message	Kotori	What is it?	
Message	Shiori	Well... Is it okay if I come closer?	
Message	Kotori	Of course you can. Come here. Don't be shy.	
Message	Kotori	"Hehe. You're so affectionate today, Shiori. That makes
me happy."	
Message	Shiori	Thank you. Hehe. Your body is warm.	
Message	Kotori	Mm... Shiori, um... Your breath is tickling me... Hee...	
Message	Shiori	S-Sorry. Am I too close?	
Message	Kotori	Huh? No, it's fine. I was just surprised.	
Message	Shiori	I see. Then I'll keep going.	
Message	Kotori	What? H-Hey, not there—Mmm!	
Message	Shiori	Your neck is so beautiful, onee-sama. I envy you.	
Message	Kotori	N-No touching, either! HAHH!	
Message	Kotori	Hya! Ahhh. No, not there.	
Message	Shiori	Your eyes are closing, onee-sama.	
Message	Kotori	"Th-They're not. They're totally not. Gosh, I'm going
to get mad soon."	
Message	Shiori	I'm sorry. But your face seemed to want more.	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Ah, hyaaaa! W-Wait.	
Message	Kotori	G-Gosh, Shiori. No. I told you no—Mmm...	
Message	None	"(I wonder why I needed a situation like this to bully
Kotori-oneesama. Thinking that made it harder for me
to stop.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder how Kotori-oneesama is feeling. I wonder if
she feels like it's forbidden to touch her little
sister.)"	
Message	Kotori	Sh-Shioriiii....	
Message	Kotori	G-Gosh, I... I can't hold back anymore.	
Message	Kotori	So, please. No more.	
Message	Shiori	Huh? Oh, I-I'm sorry.	
Message	Shiori	Sorry for not considering your feelings...	
Message	Kotori	No. It's not that.	
Message	Shiori	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"I was happy because you were more forward than
usual. That's why I can't hold back my feelings for
you, Shiori."	
Message	Kotori	So...	
Message	Shiori	But...	
Message	Shiori	"Hearing you say that, I don't think I can hold it in
any longer."	
Message	Kotori	Shiori...	
Message	Shiori	Onee-sama, any more than that...	
Message	Kotori	Ah, Shiori. It's okay. Come.	
Message	None	"(Our fingers gently entwined. Wh-What do I do?
I can't hold it in anymore.)"	
Message	Kotori	Shiori!	
Message	Shiori	Onee-sama!	
Message	Kotori	Shioriiii!	
Message	Shiori	Onee-samaaaa!	
Message	Shiori	Um, onee-sama...	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	You're such a naughty little sister. Shiori.	
Message	Shiori	I'm sorry. But I... always watch you from afar.	
Message	Shiori	"You're so amazing, and people are always around you...
Normally I wouldn't be able to be near you."	
Message	Shiori	So for now... only now...	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe. You're so cute.	
Message	Kotori	"If you say that, it makes me want to be even nicer
to you."	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. Act however you want. Is there something
you want me to do? I can do anything."	
Message	Shiori	Then... will you pet my head?	
Message	Kotori	What? That's all you want?	
Message	Shiori	...Yes.	
Message	Kotori	"That's fine. Come here. Aww, there, there... Good
girl."	
Message	Shiori	Ah...	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter? Your voice.	
Message	Shiori	N-Nothing.	
Message	Kotori	"Liar. If it's nothing, you wouldn't be making that
sound. Such a naughty voice... isn't it?"	
Message	Shiori	...?!	
Message	Kotori	Come on, tell me. Why did you make such a noise?	
Message	Shiori	O-Onee-sama, your hand...	
Message	Kotori	What about my hand, Shiori? You tell me.	
Message	Shiori	It felt really good...	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, it was that good, huh? I'm glad you're being
honest."	
Message	Kotori	"Since you were honest with me, let me reward you.
See, I'll do it more."	
Message	Shiori	...*Whimper*. Ohh...	
Message	Kotori	"It's okay. You don't have to hold back. Let me hear
your adorable voice, Shiori."	
Message	Shiori	Ohhh. Uu...mm... *sigh*...	
Message	None	"(N-no. I feel like this is extremely inappropriate.
I feel like this is a slippery slope to a place we
shouldn't go.)"	
Message	Shiori	U-Um. Onee-sama. I-It's fine. I'm good now.	
Message	Kotori	No!	
Message	Shiori	Huh?!	
Message	Kotori	I'm not satisfied yet.	
Message	Shiori	Wh-What...	
Message	Kotori	Now, don't resist.	
Message	Kotori	You tell me what you want me to do to you.	
Message	Kotori	I'll spoil you all... afternoon...	
Message	Shiori	N-No... No... Noooooo!	
Message	None	(And she played with me until she was satisfied.)	
Message	Kotori	...up. Wake up, Shiori. You'll catch a cold.	
Message	Kotori	...It's gotten late. We have to go home now.	
Message	Shiori	Oh... D-Did I fall asleep?	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. You looked adorable. Now let's go home. I took
good care of you earlier, so I want to eat something
delicious."	
Message	Shiori	U-Um... Wait, Kotori-oneesama!	
Message	None	"(It was very late when we left the school behind and
headed home together.)"
