Message	Shido	...Where am I?	
Message	None	"(I looked around me, and the landscape seemed
to stretch out endlessly. It was as if I were in a
world from a movie.)"	
Message	Arusu	What's the matter? You look surprised.	
Message	Shido	Arusu...? Why are you... Wait, what is this place?	
Message	Arusu	"At this rate, the ending will be anticlimactic.
Nothing will happen, and we will never have
an answer."	
Message	Shido	Anticlimactic? What do you mean by that?	
Message	Arusu	Show her more. Show her far beyond.	
Message	Shido	Beyond...? What do you mean, Arusu?	
Message	Shido	"Wait, this place is... from before karaoke?
Wait... did I come back?"	
Message	None	"(But what was that place earlier? It seemed like
I'd gone back to the beginning...)"	
Message	Maria	Shido Itsuka. I want you to decide something.	
Message	Shido	"Arusu... I mean Maria, is that you? Where is
everyone? What... do you want me to decide?"	
Message	Maria	Shido, you have been teaching me love.	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. That's why we're all together... hanging
out and experiencing different situations, right?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. By doing so, I was able to obtain lots of
information. But I have yet to find out... what
love is."	
Message	Shido	"Hm... You have a point... there. I don't know what
it is, either..."	
Message	Maria	That's why... I want you to choose.	
Message	Shido	Choose? You said that before... To choose...	
Message	Maria	"The people that have come here all have feelings
for you, Shido Itsuka. That is for certain."	
Message	Maria	"I want to be by Shido Itsuka's side, I want him
to be mine... Is that feeling what you call love?"	
Message	Shido	Well... I don't think that's everything.	
Message	Maria	"I think so, too. However, there is no definitive
love in this world. Therefore... I am not able to
find out what's beyond."	
Message	None	"""(What's beyond... The ""Arusu"" from earlier
mentioned the same thing.)"""	
Message	Maria	"So... Please choose. The person to whom you will
swear your love..."	
Message	Shido	I can't... choose...	
Message	Shido	I...	
Message	Maria	"And show me... What the future holds... and how
deep love can go."	
Message	Maria	"The future... with all the girls and Shido Itsuka.
The future that could have been, the future that
could be..."
