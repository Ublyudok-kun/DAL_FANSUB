Message	Miku	"Come now, let's go, darling. Who cares? Just
leave the other girls～"	
Message	Kaguya	"I don't know about that. Shido wants to spend
his life with us."	
Message	Yuzuru	Inviting. Now, Shido. Come this way.	
Message	Tohka	No! Shido is going on a date with me!	
Message	Origami	"Shido is going on a date with me. It has been
decided."	
Message	Shido	I-It's not settling down at all...	
Message	None	"(What do I do? I don't think I can call anyone
to settle this. I guess... making a run for it
might be best. But... where would I run...?)"	
Message	None	"(My little sister Kotori... Yeah. I have a feeling
she'd lecture me.)"	
Message	None	(Wait a minute. Little sister... That's right!)	
Message	Shido	I know!	
Message	Kaguya	Hey! He ran for it!	
Message	Yuzuru	Escape. Shido has attempted an escape.	
Message	Mana	"So, Ani-sama... What the hell do you want,
calling me out of the blue? I'm pretty busy,
you know."	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry, Mana. You see, um... I could only ask
you."	
Message	Mana	"W-Well, it's not like I mind. Mana is Onii-sama's
little sister by blood. Of course I'd do anything
for you."	
Message	None	"(This awkward girl is my true sister... Mana
Takamina. I was adopted by the Itsuka family,
so I don't have many memories of my childhood.)"	
Message	Shido	"Thanks so much. When I first met you, I was so
surprised, but I'm really glad to have you in my
life."	
Message	Mana	"Wh-What the hell are you talking about. You're
making me blush. So, what do you want?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, you see...	
Message	Mana	Yeah.	
Message	Shido	Mana, go on a date with me.	
Message	Mana	"I see...
"	
Message	Mana	WHAT?!	
Message	Shido	I can only ask you.	
Message	Mana	"Wh-Wh-What the hell are you blabbering on
about, Onii-sama?!"	
Message	Shido	"Please. I have to tell everyone that I have plans
with you, or I'm going to have to make the
ultimate choice with the other girls."	
Message	Mana	"I don't friggin' get it. What the hell is going
on?!"	
Message	Shido	Sorry but I don't have time to expla—Ahh!	
Message	Tohka	SHIDO!	
Message	Shido	Th-They're here.	
Message	Tohka	What happened, Shido?! You just ran away!	
Message	Origami	We haven't heard your answer yet.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Shido, it's pointless to run away.
We wouldn't run or hide anywhere."	
Message	Yuzuru	Pointing out. Kaguya, that makes no sense.	
Message	Kaguya	Sh-Shut up! Be quiet, Yuzuru!	
Message	Miku	"*Pant, pant*... darling... Not faiiirrrr.
You can't just run out of the blueeee."	
Message	Mana	Wh-What is going on?	
Message	Shido	Well... Exactly what you see...	
Message	Mana	Uh, explain...	
Message	Shido	Sorry, everyone!	
Message	Shido	"I feel bad, but as you can tell, I already had
plans with Mana, so I can't go on a date with
any of you."	
Message	Everyone	WHAT?!	
Message	Mana	N-Nii-sama...?	
Message	Shido	Now let's go, Mana. Please... Just play along.	
Message	Mana	"Hey Onii-sama... This just means you're using
my body...!"	
Message	Shido	Shhh! Sorry, just bear with me... Please.	
Message	Origami	Shido, what are you two talking about?	
Message	Shido	"N-Nothing. Anyways, we have plans! Right?
Let's go, Mana. Man, it's been a while since
it was just us, brother and sister!"	
Message	Mana	"F-Friggin right, Nii-sama! onee-sama...
Later, everyone!"	
Message	None	"(And so I found a way out of the situation.
But as I did that, Mana looked at me
judgingly...)"
