Message	Shido	Ah...	
Message	Shido	It's so noisy for being this early... *grunt*!	
Message	None	"(As I began to move, I suddenly remembered the
things that happened before this morning. It was
truly a horrible awakening.)"	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	Oh... Arusu. What are you doing...?	
Message	Arusu	"I am doing jumping exercises on top of Shido
Itsuka's body."	
Message	Shido	"Yes, I know that. I can feel your dance moves on
my stomach."	
Message	Arusu	Yes. And how is it?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean how is it... AH!	
Message	Arusu	Hahaha. You said, "AH!"	
Message	Shido	A-Are you acting like Kotori for some reason?	
Message	Arusu	...Please forget what you've seen.	
Message	Shido	You... just... get off of me.	
Message	Arusu	Yes. Understood. How was it...?	
Message	Shido	Uh, what do you mean by that?	
Message	Arusu	"...I heard that this is how you are regularly
awoken. So I attempted to replicate this method."	
Message	Shido	"Ah... Kotori does it, so I guess it does happen
often enough..."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, yes it happens, but I don't want it to be
a regular thing."	
Message	Arusu	...Was there a problem with my execution?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no, it's not your fault, Arusu. But you don't
have to do this... Rather, please don't."	
Message	Arusu	Okay.	
Message	Shido	Phew... Her heel was just about to pierce in...	
Message	Arusu	...Did I do it incorrectly?	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is what Kotori does. But... yeah, it's
not right."	
Message	Arusu	I... I'm sorry.	
Message	Shido	It's fine... Oof...	
Message	None	(...Arusu was a little heavier than Kotori.)	
Message	Arusu	"I was going to get into a routine, but I seemed to
have failed. I apologize..."	
Message	Shido	"Replicating Kotori's wake-up call shouldn't be a
benchmark of success. So don't worry about it."	
Message	Arusu	Okay... Understood.	
Message	Shido	"So, this is finally Day 2, huh?
Man, not over yet..."	
Message	Arusu	"Correct. I still do not know what love is. I wish
to know love."	
Message	Shido	Well, let's take our time.	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. I've obtained some new information. I'm
thinking of collecting feedback on it."	
Message	Shido	Feedback...?	
Message	Kotori	Hey! Shido, are you not going to get up yet?!	
Message	Kotori	"Is breakfast not ready?! Arusu, if Shido won't
wake up, just elbow him in the crotch!"	
Message	Shido	Kotori! What kind of orders are you giving her?!	
Message	Arusu	He's already awake... Although, if I should...?	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to! Rather, I'd prefer you not.
Don't do it, okay?!"	
Message	Arusu	"According to my data, this can also be taken as
the "set up". Should I follow Kotori Itsuka's
instruction?"	
Message	Shido	"No! It's not! I'm not setting you up for a bit!
I'm awake! I don't want it!"	
Message	Arusu	"This certainly satisfies the conditions.
Understood."	
Message	Shido	"...Phew. I'm glad you do... *sigh* Anyways, let's
go make breakfast."	
Message	None	"(...Arusu's acting the same as usual. I wonder who
that aggressive Arusu was last night at Takadai
Park.)"	
Message	None	"(Though, from what I saw, she did seem the same as
usual. Come to think of it, I don't exactly know
much about Arusu to begin with.)"	
Message	None	"(She's a... program? She doesn't look that way.
Maybe she's some kind of autonomous artificial
intelligence. A sentient AI.)"	
Message	Shido	Arusu, do you want to eat anything?	
Message	Arusu	Eat anything...? I have no particular need.	
Message	Shido	"I see. I guess I can make what I made yesterday.
Toast and eggs. Maybe scrambled this time. I froze
some rice too, so it doesn't have to be toast."	
Message	Arusu	"...If I can select a preference,
I would like toast."	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Come to think of it, you got seconds
yesterday, didn't you? You like toast?"	
Message	Arusu	"Like"... Maybe that's it. I would like to try it\nagain.	
Message	Shido	"Then maybe I can do grilled cheese or pizza toast.
I have some tomato sauce."	
Message	Arusu	They are both intriguing.	
Message	Shido	"Hmm, then let's do the pizza toast. There'll
be cheese on it anyways."	
Message	Arusu	Okay. Then... please make me that.	
Message	Shido	Sure. Hm...?	
Message	Arusu	Please, Shido Itsuka. Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing. I think I was just imagining things.	
Message	Arusu	Is that so?	
Message	None	"(For a second, I felt like something was off,
but... I wonder what it is... Oh well.)"
