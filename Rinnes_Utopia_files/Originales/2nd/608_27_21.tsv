Message	Shido	"All right. We're at the meeting place. Who
was able to meet up?"	
Message	Maria	Hadn't you heard from Kotori Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	"That's the thing. She told me she would
see us later. I guess that means we should
wait."	
Message	Maria	Yes. I look forward to it too.	
Message	None	"(Look forward to it? Maria was distant
from Tohka and the others. Hopefully this
will be their chance to become friends.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Heeeey! You two! Sorry for keeping you
waiting!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. It seems I'm the first to arrive.
Maria, let's have some fun."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Please take good care of me,
Tohka Yatogami."	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, I heard you are attending the date
with everyone. I cannot wait!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, leave it to me! Oh, by the way, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Is something wrong, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"I think Maria wants to strike up a friendship
with everyone."	
Message	Tohka	Ohh.	
Message	Shido	"So, if at all possible, I'd like you to befriend
Maria. What do you say?"	
Message	Tohka	"Understood, so that's the case. Hm, trust me,
Shido. This is my area of expertise!"	
Message	Shido	Haha. That's promising.	
Message	None	"(I said it, but I didn't really mean it. Tohka
looks confident, but I'm still worried.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Maria, today I will take you on a tour of my
favorite stores. I'll feed you a mountain of
sweets and savory treats!"	
Message	None	"(I knew it. Sure enough, she's already talking
about food.)"	
Message	Maria	I see. I very much look forward to it.	
Message	Miku	Ah, darling. Sorry to keep you waiting～.	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh heh. We've kept you. Shido,
and my underling, Tohka."	
Message	Shido	Miku and Kaguya, too. Thanks for coming.	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. We merely need to follow Maria as
she wanders, yes? For today, consider me your
shepherd."	
Message	Miku	Yes～. If it's a cute girl, leave it to me～.	
Message	None	"(These two are reliable. Regardless, I can't put
the burden on their shoulders alone.)"	
Message	Maria	"Thank you for today. Kaguya Yamai, Miku
Izayoi."	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. Leave it to me. Arusu will be shaped
by my mighty wind of wisdom. Feel your soul
quiver from the maiden of hurricanes!"	
Message	Miku	Indeed. Let the good times roll, Maria-chan.	
Message	Shido	Is this everyone? Then, let's head...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, my. If it isn't Shido-san. Going somewhere?	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmhmm. What a coincidence. I love the smell of
you in the morning, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi, you... This isn't some coincidence,
is it?"	
Message	Kurumi	"I haven’t the faintest idea of what you mean.
I saw an assortment of interesting individuals,
so I had to see what the commotion was about."	
Message	Maria	"Then, Kurumi Tokisaki, we have scheduled a
group date. Would you like to join us?"	
Message	Kurumi	"My, a tempting offer. But would it be okay to
join unannounced?"	
Message	Shido	"Let's see. If Maria says it's okay, then you're
more than welcome to come along. How does
everyone else feel about that?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes. Today there will be no arguing.	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh. Even with one additional person, our
objective is unchanged."	
Message	Kurumi	"Then, I accept your invitation. I have been
curious about you for a while. I hope all of
us can get along."	
Message	Maria	"Yes, same here. I, myself, have been taken
by your mysterious charm, Kurumi Tokisaki."	
Message	Kurumi	My, my.	
Message	None	"(Wowie. Even Kurumi's had the poison
sucked out of her. Not bad, Maria.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, if we're done chatting, then let's begin
our conquest. Time is precious, after all."	
Message	Shido	Whoops. That's right. All right, then let's move.	
Message	Tohka	Yeaaah!	
Message	Miku	Yeaaah!	
Message	Maria	Yeeeah, I believe.	
Message	None	"(Now, Maria's first holiday celebration has
begun.)"
