Message	None	(Yoshino has been acting weird lately.)	
Message	None	"(Normally, she is reserved, choosing not to
express something even if bothered her.)"	
Message	Kotori	So, what's going on?	
Message	Shido	"That's what I'm asking! Why are you taking
me away without any explanation? And what
the hell is he doing here, anyway?!"	
Message	Shido	"...I mean, what reason would Kannazuki-san
have for being at our school?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"My duties are best served at the immediate
side of the commander."	
Message	Shido	That's not what I'm talking about.	
Message	Kotori	This is an emergency. It can't be helped.	
Message	Shido	...An emergency? What's going on?	
Message	Kotori	"Lately, or whenever Yoshino and you started
getting closer, she's become more unstable."	
Message	Shido	...Really?	
Message	Kotori	"Just so you know, our machines aren't broken.
Shido, don't tell me you did the unspeakable―"	
Message	Shido	N-No, I didn't! I swear I didn't!	
Message	Kannazuki	"But Commander, Shido-kun and Yoshino-san
are an item, so their activities shouldn't result
in instability."	
Message	Kotori	I'm not talking about that!	
Message	Kannazuki	OW! Thank you!	
Message	None	"(Kotori drop-kicked Kannazuki-san before
turning around to face me. He dropped to
the floor, grinning in ecstasy like a weirdo.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"It is true that you and Yoshino have been
getting much closer. There's no telling what
the future holds. Are you doing your job...?"	
Message	Shido	"Calm down, Kotori. Nothing fishy is going on.
I swear! I haven't done anything that you would
disapprove of!"	
Message	Kotori	Don't tell me you haven't kissed yet.	
Message	Shido	No, we haven't...	
Message	Kotori	"I suppose there was a chance that would
happen. Shido, something between you
and Yoshino had to have caused this."	
Message	Shido	"Like I said, our relationship is totally healthy
and wholesome! We've gone on dates, but all
we do is talk, eat, and hang out!"	
Message	None	"(Kotori glanced over at Kannazuki-san while
he played with some device.)"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Commander, it seems as though Shido-kun
is speaking the truth."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. He really didn't do anything... Or Shido's
doing something so unspeakable that he has
convinced himself it is okay."	
Message	Shido	"What is that machine?! I don't know how else
to convince you!"	
Message	Kotori	"Then, explain why Yoshino may be stressed.
Um, the two of you like each other, right?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, that's right.	
Message	Kannazuki	So Yoshino-san didn't say anything to you?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I mean, I noticed that Yoshino's been
acting strangely recently too."	
Message	None	(Kotori's eyebrow twitched.)	
Message	Shido	"We're happy whenever we're together, but
there are times when I suspect Yoshino
might be forcing herself."	
Message	Kotori	I see. So?	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's what was bothering me. I was
asking myself how I need to proceed, and
that's when you called me in for a talk."	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. I don't need to hear excuses.	
Message	Shido	You were the one who brought me here!	
Message	Kannazuki	"Commander, Shido-kun's picked up on the
fact something may disturbing her. That is
all the confirmation we need for now."	
Message	Kotori	"...You have a point. Guess I'll let this slide for
today."	
Message	None	"(Kannazuki-san, for once in his life, gave a
level-headed opinion, to which Kotori had
reluctantly complied.)"	
Message	Shido	"Um, so is Yoshino okay? You mentioned that
she's unstable."	
Message	Kotori	"It's hard to say. Maybe it's not exactly an
emergency, but anything can be a trigger."	
Message	Shido	Got it. So we can't ignore it then.	
Message	Kannazuki	"The situation aside, the commander was
simply worried about you, Shido-kun―"	
Message	Kotori	You don't need to tell him that!	
Message	Kannazuki	Thank you...!	
Message	Shido	"Um. It looks like she got you pretty good there.
Are you okay...?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Fear not... If I were to die, I could be replaced
instantly."	
Message	None	"(So he's a program. He's as happy as usual.
If he says he's fine, I'll leave it at that.)"	
Message	Kotori	"...Hmph. Stupid Shido saying stupid things
and messing everything up. So stupid."	
Message	Shido	"Stop calling me stupid. Anyways, there isn't
an immediate threat, is there? Can you trust
me with this?"	
Message	Kotori	"Right. We have no choice, I guess. In the
meantime, we'll be observing her."	
Message	Kannazuki	"I feel terrible thrusting the burden onto you
in this dire time."	
Message	Kotori	"Right. We'll have to leave it to you, but if
anything happens, let us know at once."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	None	(I immediately gave Yoshino a call after that.)	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, um... Shido-san, you say you wanted to
talk."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, are you finally confessing your feelings?\nYou two are already a thing, so maybe not.\nIs there something more important?"	
Message	Shido	Well, it definitely is important.	
Message	Yoshino	What...? U-Um, does that mean...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Are we booking a temple or a church? Yoshino\ncould pull off either dress, but I personally\nthink a church is better―"	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it! I'm not talking about the
future. I'm talking about right now."	
Message	Yoshino	Now...?	
Message	Shido	"Yes. Yoshino, I sense there's something
bothering you."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, well...	
Message	Shido	You're not going to deny it, huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah. I mean, Yoshino's totally smitten.\nOf course she's stressed. Shido-kun,\nyou feel the same, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	"I guess. Yoshino, does your stress have
anything to do with me?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, well... Um...	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino. If I did something to bother you,
you can talk to me about it."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"I want to help you, Yoshino. Whatever it
takes. Even if I'm not of any use, even then―"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, well...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmm. There's nothing you can do for\nher, Shido-kun."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon?!	
Message	Shido	Is that true...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Right. I mean, it's not necessarily your job\nto fix it, know what I mean?"	
Message	Shido	I don't really follow. Am I involved at all?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes, y-you are...	
Message	Shido	Then, would you tell me?	
Message	Yoshino	W-Well, it's embarrassing.	
Message	None	(I gasped.)	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I'm sorry! If you're uncomfortable talking
about it, I don't want to force you."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't worry. It's not the kind of embarrassing\nyou might be thinking."	
Message	Shido	Oh. That's a relief.	
Message	Yoshinon	"But maybe her worries play into it a bit."	
Message	Shido	So what's the issue?!	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I don't know how to put it, but what made
you think I was stressing, Shido-san?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I noticed you behave a little differently.
I got worried, so I wanted to wait until you
were ready to talk about it."	
Message	None	"(I knew Yoshino wasn't ready to talk about
it, but Kotori had to bring it up. So I decided
this use this opportunity to ask.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, well, p-please don't laugh, okay?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I won't.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I know... th-this isn't a big deal to you...	
Message	Yoshino	But I'm small...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but you're not much shorter than
Kotori. What's wrong with that?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um...	
Message	Shido	Because you're small...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Basically, Yoshino thinks she's causing you\nstress because she looks really youthful. It's\nbeen a source of anxiety for her."	
Message	Shido	I see. Is that really something to worry about?	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yes, it is...! I-I was... stressing so much
about it!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right, Shido-kun. It's kinda messed\nup for you to dismiss her concerns like that."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, I didn't mean to. I mean, I could see
how that might be stressful..."	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san, does it really not bother you?	
Message	Shido	"Now that you mention it, the thought never
even crossed my mind."	
Message	Yoshino	...Oh.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Really? You had better not be just saying that!"	
Message	Shido	What's the point in lying about it?	
Message	None	"(Well, there are moments when I hope others
don't get the wrong idea, but that's it.)"	
Message	Shido	"Don't tell me this is what the whole coffee
incident was about. Did you order it because
you were self-conscious about your height?"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, well...	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right. Isn't black coffee a mature drink?\nIf only she could learn to like it."	
Message	None	"(I didn't have the heart that the thought itself
was a bigger indication of her maturity.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"I mean, there are other factors. She tried\nwearing more mature clothes, but there\naren't many she can get in her size."	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-You don't have to disclose that...! If it
looked bad, I wouldn't have said anything..."	
Message	Shido	I would've wanted to see it.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ah, Shido-kun. You like the thought of\nYoshino in baggy clothes, huh?"	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What...? That's awkward...	
Message	Shido	Oh, um, well...	
Message	None	"(I don't blame her for feeling self-conscious,
but I couldn't get myself to tell her not to
force it.)"	
Message	Yoshino	But if you really wanted to see, then, um...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshino? That's where you're wrong.	
Message	Yoshino	...! I'm wrong?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Yoshino, you're adorable.
Almost too adorable for me.
I think you're too accommodating."	
Message	Yoshinon	"You are her boyfriend, Shido-kun. Would you\nbe happier if she listened to you?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, if it comes naturally, then sure. But
Yoshino, I feel like you're forcing yourself."	
Message	Yoshino	Forcing myself? I...	
Message	Shido	"Are you forcing yourself to be more mature
because it bothered you so much?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, well... That's because I want to be, so I...	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, if it means so much to you, I won't
say anything."	
Message	Shido	"But listen to me, Yoshino. I've told you many
times that I don't expect you to act any kind
of way."	
Message	Shido	"In fact, if it's distressing you, then that makes
me feel worse."	
Message	Yoshino	"You don't mind how young I look...?
Would you still... have feelings for me?"	
Choice		I like how youthful you are.	
Choice		I like you the way you are.	
Message	Shido	Actually, I like your child-like sense of wonder.	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, be careful. You're flirting with\ndangerous territory."	
Message	Shido	"Th-That's not what I meant! I mean, I like
the side of you that is interested in the world
around you."	
Message	Yoshino	But it's true that I want to be more mature...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I like you the way you are, Yoshino.
But if you want to work on your maturity,
then I can help you."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whoa. There it is! He's right. Maturity\ncomes with experience, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	"Okay... But it's true that I do want to be
more mature."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Yoshino	"But if you're not embarrassed to be around me,
then is it okay... if we take our time?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I don't care how long it takes.	
Message	Yoshino	"I want to go on dates with you, and eat
parfaits instead of drinking coffee, and
drink juice, too."	
Message	Yoshino	"Rather than look at clothes, we can look at
plushies. Is it okay... that I'm like this?
And that I'm with you?"	
Message	Shido	Of course. I like you the way you are.	
Message	Shido	"Sure, your tastes will change over time.
I don't expect either of us to be this way
forever."	
Message	Shido	"But that's all part of it, you know? I feel like
when the time comes, I will still want to be
with you."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes. I, too, want to be with you. Even if it
takes time, I want to be with you...!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"WOOHOO! Now that's young love. You two\nare so perfect for each other. I'm so happy!"	
Message	Yoshino	Hm... You think so? The thought... elates me.	
Message	Yoshinon	"If Shido-kun likes you the way you are,\nand means it, that's all that matters."	
Message	Yoshinon	"What would be awful is he said all those\nthings, then changed his mind in the future.\nThen all your stress would be vindicated."	
Message	Shido	That would never happen.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Sure～. You have to keep your word,\nor I won't let Yoshino stay with you."	
Message	Shido	I'll do my best to ensure you trust me.	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Thank you so much.	
Message	Shido	"You're welcome. Then again, I have to hold
up my end of the bargain and make sure you'll
still want to be with me too."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, you're.. fine the way you are, no?	
Message	Shido	Haha. You think so?	
Message	Yoshino	I do.	
Message	None	(Yoshino quietly nuzzled herself closer.)	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san, can I ask you a favor...?	
Message	Shido	Within reason, sure...	
Message	Yoshino	Could you stoop down, and... close your eyes?	
Message	Shido	...Sure.	
Message	None	(I did as she asked and shut my eyes.)	
Message	None	"(Her fingers softly grazed my cheek, and
I felt her slow exhale.)"	
Message	None	(I waited quietly...)	
Message	Yoshino	Mm...	
Message	None	"(Then, I felt something soft press against my
forehead.)"	
Message	Shido	...Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, that was me... I wanted to express, in the
best way I could, how much I like you..."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I tried my best, but... this is all I can
muster."	
Message	Shido	...Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	Why are you apologizing? Um, it makes me...	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...	
Message	Shido	"I'm not upset at all. What is your problem,
Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, you're such a gentleman, but\nhow long will that last?"	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about, Yoshinon?
I would never do anything to hurt Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshinon	"So you'll do anything if she wills it? Bold\nstatement, Shido-kun."	
Message	Shido	Cross my heart, hope to die.	
Message	None	(Yoshino blushed and looked me in the eye.)	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, I'm still shy when it comes to taking
initiative, so this is the best I can do, but..."	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san, when it comes to you, I do not
mind whatever... you want to do with me."	
Message	Yoshino	S-So, I'll wait until you're ready...	
Message	None	"(Hearing her express herself so directly
almost blew my mind, but it was a reminder
that I could never do anything to hurt her.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...	
Message	None	(I pulled Yoshino in close to me softly.)	
Message	None	"(...and I gave her a gentle kiss on the
forehead.)"
