Message	Shido	All right, that about does it.	
Message	Shido	I'm done with today's dishes.	
Message	None	"(I felt like I was done with the day's work and
stretched out as far as I could.)"	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Shido, are you done?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, for the most part.	
Message	Kotori	Good job. Thanks for always cleaning.	
Message	Shido	No worries.	
Message	None	"(Kotori gave me words of appreciation as she lay
across on the couch reading a magazine.)"	
Message	Shido	What are you reading, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Hm? This?	
Message	None	"(Kotori showed me a colorful front cover of a
magazine. There were words with colorful images of
foliage.)"	
Message	Shido	A travel magazine?	
Message	Kotori	Yup. I bought it because it seemed cool.	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, it was peak travel season right
now. It said so on TV yesterday, too.)"	
Message	None	"(A trip, huh? I wonder when the last time was that I
went on a trip with Kotori.)"	
Message	Kotori	Come on, Shido. Sit down. Let's read it together.	
Message	Shido	Sure. But why are you standing?	
Message	Kotori	Don't worry about it.	
Message	None	"(Kotori got off the sofa and gave me space to sit.
She even got me a throw pillow and tapped on it.)"	
Message	None	"(I had no reason to decline, so I did as Kotori said,
and sat down on the sofa.)"	
Message	Kotori	Okay, then.	
Message	None	"(Kotori then sat on my lap as if it were something
natural to do.)"	
Message	Kotori	Hehe. This is the most comfortable place.	
Message	Shido	You are sure something...	
Message	Kotori	Oh, you didn't like it?	
Message	Shido	That's not the case, but...	
Message	None	(Well, I don't mind her sitting on me, either.)	
Message	None	(Or rather, sitting on top of me.)	
Message	None	(Here, on my lap, was Kotori's small butt.)	
Message	None	(The feeling that I had in my knees was... Yeah.)	
Message	Kotori	I can get off if you don't like it?	
Message	Shido	No, it's totally fine.	
Message	None	(I rushed to stop Kotori, and she stared at me.)	
Message	Kotori	*stare*...	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	Are you thinking of something naughty?	
Message	Shido	N-naughty? Not at all.	
Message	Kotori	Are you sure?	
Message	Shido	"I'm sure. Cross my heart. I swear on whatever god you
want me to."	
Message	Kotori	"What's the point in such cheap promise... Oh well,
whatever."	
Message	None	"(Kotori fidgeted and moved around to find the best
position. Phew. I was able to dodge that question.)"	
Message	None	"(But man... She used to be so much smaller. She would
always say, "Onii-chan, Onii-chan," and sit on my lap.)"	
Message	None	"(Back then, she was the size of a plushie, and I
could see clear over her head, even when she sat on
my lap.)"	
Message	None	"(Thinking about how much Kotori has grown is making
me emotional.)"	
Message	Shido	You sure got big, Kotori. And heavy.	
Message	Kotori	Yaaah?!	
Message	None	"(The minute I said that, Kotori literally jumped up
like a surprised cat.)"	
Message	Kotori	"H-H-H-HEAVY?! OF COURSE NOT! That's something you
should never say to a girl!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Sorry. But it's not like we can't help it. You're a
growing girl."	
Message	Kotori	Growing... That sounds like a convenient excuse.	
Message	Shido	"No. I mean you grew. Your hair is longer, your body's
become more feminine."	
Message	Kotori	H-Hau...?!	
Message	Shido	"Remember how you used to sit on my lap when you
were a kid? You're way bigger than those days."	
Message	Shido	"But back in the day, you were this small and so cute.
Well, of course you're still cute."	
Message	None	"(If I praise her too much about her childhood, she's
going to get mad asking about herself from now. So I
know I covered my bases!)"	
Message	None	"(Or so I thought... but Kotori's reaction wasn't what
I expected.)"	
Message	Kotori	G-Gosh! Shido, you idiot!	
Message	Shido	Oof?!	
Message	None	"(She threw the cushion at my face, then picked it back
up with both hands and started pounding on me with
it.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. You hear that? You said "OOF!" You really
think you can turn this switch off?!"	
Message	Shido	Ow! Ow, ow! Kotori, stop! Calm down!	
Message	Kotori	"Girls are sensitive! "Big" and "heavy" are words you
can't say!"	
Message	Shido	Okay! I got it! I give up! Please!	
Message	None	"(I showed her I was harmless, and Kotori finally
stopped.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori's shoulders rose and fell with each deep
breath, and then she turned away, pouting.)"	
Message	Kotori	"...You idiot. If you say that to me, I'll get self-
conscious."	
Message	Kotori	"I'm not a little girl any more. I'm your girlfriend...
so don't treat me like your little sister forever."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... You're right. My bad.	
Message	None	"(Kotori is my girlfriend. She wasn't wrong that I was
looking at her like a little sister, so she must have
been frustrated.)"	
Message	Kotori	And if I get fat...	
Message	Shido	If you get fat?	
Message	Kotori	You might hate me, Shido...	
Message	Shido	That's not something to hate someone for.	
Message	Kotori	"I want to avoid the possibilities! I don't want you to
lose an ounce of interest towards me."	
Message	None	"(That was a cute thing to say. Seeing her that bummed
made me feel bad.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry. Come on, sit.	
Message	None	"(This time I offered my lap to her. Kotori stared at
me for a little while and slowly sat back down.)"	
Message	Kotori	...A-Am I heavy at all?	
Message	Shido	"You're light. Totally light. Almost too light. You'd
better eat more."	
Message	Shido	Aside from your midnight cake snack.	
Message	Kotori	*groan*...	
Message	Shido	Next time, be sure to tell me before you eat it.	
Message	Kotori	Okay...	
Message	None	(I reached out for the magazine and opened it.)	
Message	Shido	So, Kotori. You want to go on a trip?	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. That would be nice.	
Message	Kotori	But it's difficult in reality.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah? We can go during summer break. It's not that
odd to go on a family trip."	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, you totally don't get it.	
Message	None	"Kotori's shoulders slumped and she whispered in my
ear."	
Message	Kotori	I meant I want to go on a trip with just you.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Hehe... You're blushing.	
Message	Shido	Sh-Shut up.	
Message	None	"(She poked me playfully. I gave a boring response.
Damn it... It's not fair she gets me out of the blue
like this.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Now, look. There have been a lot of great deals
lately. There are packages for couples, too."	
Message	None	"(Kotori turned the page, and there was a section
targeting couples.)"	
Message	Shido	"We can take a plane to get there fast, and then go
sightseeing. Or we can go by train and enjoy the ride.
Hard call."	
Message	Kotori	"I don't mind either, as long as I'm with you. I'll
have fun regardless."	
Message	Shido	Me, too.	
Message	None	"(Whether its sightseeing or traveling, as long as I'm
with Kotori, I'm sure it'll be fun.)"	
Message	Shido	There are so many places to go.	
Message	Kotori	"I know, right? I can't decide. Where do you wanna
go, Shido?"	
Choice		Vacation in the southern islands	
Choice		Slow life at the hot springs	
Choice		Hardcore snow mountaineering	
Message	Shido	The southern islands might be nice.	
Message	Shido	"Okinawa would be good. Or we can go overseas to Guam
or something."	
Message	Kotori	Ah, the islands, huh? That sounds nice.	
Message	Shido	I do want to go at least once.	
Message	None	"(As a common person, I can't help but dream of
vacationing in the islands. It seems to be a typical
trip for even young people.)"	
Message	None	"(It would be nice to go to a warm place and just let
loose and have fun.)"	
Message	Kotori	"The islands... Then of course we'll be near the ocean.
I need to buy a swimsuit."	
Message	None	"(The islands are all about swimsuits... That's right.
A swimsuit! And a date at the beach...!)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido, hurry! I'm going to leave you behind!	
Message	Shido	Wait for me, Kotori!	
Message	Shido	Yah! I'm going to splash you with water!	
Message	Kotori	Ah! So cooold. I'm going to get you back!	
Message	Shido	Ahahaha!	
Message	Kotori	Ufufufu!	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido. What do you think about this swimsuit?	
Message	Kotori	I tried a wild one for you.	
Message	Shido	A-A wild one?!	
Message	Kotori	"See how sexy it is? Like this area, and this area. You
might be able to see things."	
Message	Shido	KOTORIIIIII!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, myyy. Shido, you wolf!	
Message	Kotori	Shido? I said SHIDO!	
Message	Shido	...*gasp*!	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh, Shido. You were totally thinking of perverted
things just now, weren't you?"	
Message	Shido	N-No! I totally wasn't!	
Message	None	(It was a bit too wild, even for me.)	
Message	Kotori	Are you sure? Shido, I can read you like a book.	
Message	Kotori	You looked the same earlier when I sat on your lap.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not true!	
Message	None	"(I couldn't help but touch my face, and Kotori looked
at me doubtfully.)"	
Message	Kotori	See, you totally imagined it.	
Message	Shido	*grunt*...	
Message	None	"(I had no rebuttal. Kotori gave me a cold stare and
looked forward.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido... If you imagine this with other girls, you won't
hear the end of it."	
Message	Kotori	But since it's me, I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	Oh, I can? But... I feel like that's inappropriate, too.	
Message	Shido	I want to just take it slow at the hot springs.	
Message	Kotori	That sounds nice, too. But kinda old.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, don't be rude. Hot springs are the heart of Japan.
It's a prized part of Japanese culture."	
Message	Shido	"If we're going to rest, it's best done at the hot
springs."	
Message	None	(Kotori flipped through the pages.)	
Message	Kotori	But I feel like they're targeting older people.	
Message	Shido	"That's not true. Lately, even young people are into
hot springs. Or so I've heard."	
Message	Kotori	"Ah, you might be right. There are a lot of places.
Didn't know."	
Message	None	"(In the magazine, there was an article about hot
springs. There were plans for young people and
trendy looking hotels and other places.)"	
Message	Shido	"I like how easy it is to get to. We won't spend
too much time traveling, compared to going overseas."	
Message	Kotori	"You're right. It seems like we can even go on a day
trip."	
Message	Kotori	"Open-aired baths seems good, but even the inside baths
seem good, too."	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, if its meant for couples,
there'd be a lot of inside baths. Then does that
mean... what I think it means? *gulp*)"	
Message	Kotori	Don't stare at me too much, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. Kotori, you're so shy.	
Message	Kotori	"O-Of course. Bathing with you... I'm so embarrassed,
I want to die."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori, come here. Wash my back.	
Message	Kotori	Wow. Shido. Your back is so big... and strong...	
Message	Kotori	Hey... Can you wash mine, too?	
Message	Kotori	Shido? I said SHIDO!	
Message	Shido	...*gasp*!	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter? You're in a daze. You look kind of
red, too."	
Message	Shido	It's nothing! Nothing at all!	
Message	Kotori	At all?	
Message	Shido	Nothing!	
Message	None	"(I was speaking in a panic. I tried to play it off, but...
huh? Kotori gave me a cold stare.)"	
Message	Kotori	Were you thinking of something naughty, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Not at all!	
Message	Kotori	The fact that you're answering so quickly is suspect.	
Message	None	"(Kotori got in investigation mode and I had no choice
but to confess everything.)"	
Message	Shido	"Let's try challenging ourselves to some winter
mountain climbing!"	
Message	None	(Kotori's expression turned serious at my suggestion.)	
Message	Kotori	"The mountains are dangerous. Especially in the winter.
Do you know how dangerous the snowy mountains can
be?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, we'll figure it out. As long as it's me and you.	
Message	None	"(Nothing to be so serious over. Kotori and I can
overcome any obstacle!)"	
Message	None	(Like this!)	
Message	Kotori	"No, Shido! I can't see in front of me because of the
snowstorm!"	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me, Kotori! This way! I'll take your hand!	
Message	Kotori	You're so reliable, Shido!	
Message	Kotori	Ah! Shido! An avalanche!	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me Kotori! I'll stop it! HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	Kotori	Wow, Shido!	
Message	Kotori	Ah! Shido! A cliff! We'll fall!	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me, Kotori! Grab on to me. Don't let go!	
Message	Kotori	I will never let go! NEVER!	
Message	Kotori	Shido... I'm cold.	
Message	Shido	"Leave it to me, Kotori! I'll warm you with my body
heat! Now come here..."	
Message	Kotori	Ah, Shido, you're warm...	
Message	None	(Heh. I'm totally cool. I'm so reliable, it scares me.)	
Message	Kotori	I see... Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"If you're ready for it, then I won't stop you. You
wait here."	
Message	None	(Kotori got her cell out.)	
Message	Kotori	"It's me. Can you prepare 7 days of food and cold-
resistant equipment for extreme weathers? Yeah.
We're going winter mountain climbing. The Himalayas.)"	
Message	None	(...Wait, what? The Himalayas?)	
Message	Kotori	"I want to prepare things for the best winter mountain
climbing experience. ...I know it's dangerous. We
may never come back to Japan."	
Message	None	"(W-Wait a minute. it's turning into a bigger deal than
I thought...)"	
Message	Kotori	"But this is what Shido wants. Please. Don't turn me
into a dumb girl who's just going to send my boyfriend
alone to a dangerous place."	
Message	Kotori	"And you know what to do if I don't return, right? You
idiot... Don't cry. It's not for sure that I'll die yet...
*sniffle*."	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. I'll be watching over everyone from the sky.
Well, good-bye everyone..."	
Message	Shido	Wait, wait. I'm sorry! I was wrong!	
Message	None	"(I don't know who she was talking to, but I bowed to
her in the living room to stop her.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Phew. That was fun. I read the whole book cover to
cover."	
Message	Shido	It's my first time reading this much.	
Message	None	"(In the end, we talked about traveling for about an
hour.)"	
Message	Shido	Even if we don't go, it's fun just talking about it.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori?	
Message	None	(Kotori suddenly fell silent, giving a downcast look.)	
Message	Kotori	"Sorry, just talking to you about it just made me
really want to go."	
Message	Kotori	"It'll be so fun going on a trip with the two of us.
But it'll be difficult."	
Message	None	"(She muttered in a melancholy way. Aww. Hearing her
say that much, how can I stay quiet?)"	
Message	Shido	All right, leave it to me. I'll figure something out.	
Message	None	(I spoke strongly as I patted her head.)	
Message	Shido	It's fine. Let's travel wherever we want.	
Message	Kotori	But...	
Message	Shido	"Don't give me that look. If you think we can't go now,
then we really won't be able to go."	
Message	Kotori	You think so...?	
Message	Shido	I know so.	
Message	Shido	"And besides, if I can't take you on a trip, I'm failing
as a boyfriend."	
Message	Kotori	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Kotori finally looked up. I tried to smile warmly and
then laughed.)"	
Message	Shido	"It may be difficult, but it's not impossible. We'll figure
it out."	
Message	Kotori	Can I trust you?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, leave it to me.	
Message	Kotori	...Shido. I love you so much.	
Message	None	"(Kotori jumped on me with the biggest smile on her
face. I held onto her tightly.)"	
Message	None	"(It's been a while since I've seen Kotori so happy. I
guess she's really looking forward to it.)"	
Message	None	(Now... I guess I'll go buy a travel magazine, too.)
