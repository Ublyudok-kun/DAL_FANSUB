Message	Kaguya	"Bwahahaha, my dear brother. How am I going to best
adore you today?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hm? Wait, we're in a classroom now... Whatever, I
don't mind the small details."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Assumption. Kaguya, I think it's already over. We
are back in reality, and this is our classroom."	
Message	Kaguya	Wh-What?!	
Message	Shido	"Hey... Don't tell me, Yuzuru, you were my older
sister and Kaguya was my younger sister?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmation. That is exactly right.	
Message	Shido	"Was that really a dream? Do you guys ever question
that you're sharing the same dreams?"	
Message	Kaguya	What do you mean? It happens to everyone.	
Message	Shido	No it doesn't!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Question. It makes sense for us, but how did you
know the content of our dreams?"	
Message	Shido	"Because I experienced something similar. It was
weird, but it wasn't exactly a dream..."	
Message	Kaguya	"Wait a minute! Sh-Shido, you know about that
dream, too?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I think I saw the same exact thing. In the
bed, you two..."	
Message	Kaguya	"I-I didn't know about this! Th-That's so
embarrassing! Ahhhh!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Stop. Please wait, Kaguya. Don't leave Yuzuru.	
Message	Shido	Hey, guys!
