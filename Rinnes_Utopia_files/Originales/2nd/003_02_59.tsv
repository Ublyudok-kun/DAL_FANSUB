Message	Miku	"Awww, darling! Hurry up and come! Let's go
do something fun."	
Message	Kaguya	"Do not let her entice you, Shido. We Yamai
sisters will take good care of you."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Searching. There is a delicious cake shop near
here, Shido. We will take you there."	
Message	Tohka	"What, cake shop?! That's a great idea, Shido.
Let us go to the cake shop together."	
Message	Origami	"Shido doesn't like to snack. So you should go
shopping with me."	
Message	Shido	Damn... What can I do to settle things down...	
Message	Ai	"Oh, it's Itsuka-kun～ He's playing around with
girls again."	
Message	Mai	"Gosh, and in a public place too... He sure lacks
a sense of propriety!"	
Message	Mii	Seriously, what a turn off.	
Message	Shido	"Wow, if it isn't Yamabuki, Hazakura, and
Fujibakama! The trio that likes to show up,
make their comments, and leave."	
Message	Ai	"Hey, can you not treat us like some kind of
audience of yours?"	
Message	Mai	"Just because you're popular, you think you're
all that."	
Message	Mii	What a turn off.	
Message	None	"(They're going to see this situation and
eventually spread crazy rumors throughout
the school.)"	
Message	Shido	"However! I'm going to turn
this into an opportunity!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey Yamabuki, Hazakura, Fujibakama! I...
suddenly am really interested in you guys!
All right, let's hang out!"	
Message	Ai	...What?	
Message	Mai	...Excuse me?!	
Message	Mii	What a turn off.	
Message	Shido	"Come on, it shouldn't be bad to hang out from
time to time, right? We're classmates, so we
should be friends..."	
Message	Ai	O-Oh, I just remembered I had to run errands!	
Message	Mai	Ahhh, Mother!	
Message	Mii	S-Seriously, what a turn off!	
Message	Shido	Heh... I guess this is the sin of my charms...	
Message	Kaguya	Wh-What the...? Shido, what's gotten into you?	
Message	Yuzuru	Assumption. Maybe he ate something funny.	
Message	Origami	"Shido has acted like this in the past. I don't
find it odd."	
Message	Tohka	Hm... You're not your usual self, Shido...	
Message	Miku	But I think this side of you is cool, darling.	
Message	Shido	"Okay... So the trio is gone and everyone else
is dumbfounded... So I should just..."	
Message	None	(And that is how I escaped from everyone.)
