Message	Kurumi	"I see. What a troublesome opponent.
All of these bullets will disappear."	
Message	Miku	"Quite right. There are so many of them,
so many attacking at once, that it's such
a nuisance～."	
Message	Marina	"Hm. You were the one boasting about how
easy this was going to be. Maybe you're not
as strong as you think?"	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. How upsetting. This is no challenge;
are you putting words in my mouth?"	
Message	Miku	"Speak for yourself, Kurumi-san. This is
no walk in the park for me."	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, my. Now you've said it. Why, you're the
most confident person I know."	
Message	Miku	"You're the last person I want telling me
that. You're always confident and in control."	
Message	Marina	Why are you so relaxed?!	
Message	Marina	"You're annoying... Aren't you exhausted yet?
Just begone, disappear!"	
Message	Kurumi	"My, oh my. We're only just beginning.
We aren't the slightest bit exhausted, either."	
Message	Miku	"Yup, too true. If you can't bear us toying with
you a bit, then maybe you're an impatient one."	
Message	Marina	"Wha?! Their Spiritual power hasn't decayed
at all... Is this what Diva can do?!"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, of course. Now then, fate brought us
together, so let's work as a team."	
Message	Kurumi	"Kihi... Kihi... Kihihihihi! I will show you the
ultimate stage."	
Message	Marina	Wha... I'll shut that blabbering mouth!	
Message	Miku	"Even if there's so many of you, it's useless.
After all, check this out... Gabriel, Solo!"	
Message	Marina	Wha... Why can't I move?	
Message	Miku	"Aww, too bad. Even in your own dominion,
you can't brainwash us."	
Message	Kurumi	"Piece of cake. If they're frozen, all I need to
do is pick them off.... Zafkiel."	
Message	Marina	"This is nothing! You think these measly attacks
can phase me!"	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, yes. That's right. Normal attacks won't do...	
Message	Marina	Normal attacks...?	
Message	Kurumi	If you require more, I'll give you more...	
Message	Kurumi	Zafkiel... Aleph.	
Message	Marina	"Are they getting faster?! Rgh, this is...
Aaaaaagh!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Did I only kill one? Oh, my. Looks like I got
another one behind her too... Kihi, kihihihi!"	
Message	Miku	"Umm, Kurumi-san. If you squash them one
by one, even with all the time in the world, it
still won't be enough!"	
Message	Kurumi	"You're right... Perhaps I should ask "myself"
to help as well..."	
Message	Marina	"Hands from the shadows... This is the power
of Nightmare!"	
Message	Kurumi	"No need to act so surprised, eh? You're
using a similar power after all."	
Message	Marina	Ngh... Why you!	
Message	Miku	Don't move, okay? Gabriel... Solo!	
Message	Kurumi	May I have the next turn, Miku-san?	
Message	Miku	Guess it can't be helped～. Just one, okay?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes...	
Message	Marina	This is... Rgh, I can still call reinforcements!	
Message	Miku	It's useless, you know? Gabriel... Rondo!	
Message	Miku	AAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Marina	AAAAH!	
Message	Kurumi	"Now then, the curtains are ready to drop.
Kihihihihihi!"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, Kurumi-san. Let's end it. Time for
the finale!"
