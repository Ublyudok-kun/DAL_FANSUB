Message	Shido	Hmm... Where did Maria go...	
Message	Shido	"She's not here... She should still be inside the
school, right? She did say she was going to
observe it today..."	
Message	Shido	I don't think she'd be here...	
Message	Shido	—Oh, there she is. Hey, Maria...	
Message	Arusu	Oh, Shido Itsuka. This is a good place, isn't it?	
Message	Shido	The way you're talking. You're...	
Message	Arusu	"I haven't seen you since yesterday, Shido Itsuka.
Hehe, so you've started to call her Maria, have
you?"	
Message	Shido	"You... or, maybe it wasn't you... but she wanted
to be called by another name."	
Message	Arusu	I see. But isn't it confusing with both names?	
Message	Shido	Well, but...	
Message	Arusu	"I told you yesterday. I am Arusu. Arusu. So, Shido
Itsuka, can you call me that?"	
Message	Shido	Okay, Arusu...	
Message	Arusu	"Yes, that's right. I am Arusu. Ahaha... I wonder
why. It's become fun. Almost to the point that
it's not enough."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, there you are. I heard you were heading up to
the rooftop, so I wanted to talk to you—"	
Message	Arusu	—Sorry, you're in the way.	
Message	Shido	T-Tonomachi...? He disappeared?!	
Message	None	"(That light... Did Arusu really do that? Tonomachi
disappeared as if he were broken up into light
particles.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! What was that?!	
Message	Arusu	"Hahaha! Just the opening act. The people in this
world disappear so easily."	
Message	Shido	What the hell?! What did you do to Tonomachi?!	
Message	Arusu	"What are you mad about? What's the point in
getting hysterical over an NPC? It's just a
program."	
Message	Shido	But, he's alive here like in the real world—	
Message	Tonomachi	—Huh? What happened to me...?	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi?! Are you okay?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh? What? Oh yeah, I thought I had something to
tell you... Oh well, guess I'll head back to the
classroom."	
Message	Shido	So... nothing's wrong with him?	
Message	Arusu	"Obviously. He's just a program. It's easy to
recover the data. Wasn't that fun?"	
Message	Shido	"Of course it's not fun to see your friend just
disappear into thin air!"	
Message	Arusu	Are you some kind of hero of justice?	
Message	Shido	"That's not what I mean, but... I think what you
did was definitely wrong."	
Message	Arusu	"But I won't apologize. There's nothing that can't
be done in this world."	
Message	Shido	"That's not true! This world is no different from
reality!"	
Message	Arusu	"No need to be so naïve about it.
...I think it's almost time."	
Message	Shido	...Time?	
Message	Arusu	"Yup. Time for something fun to happen. Hurry up
and tell the other one what love or whatever is."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about—	
Message	Arusu	"I'm waiting for it too. I'm sure you'll
understand then."	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait!	
Message	Arusu	"Now take a step forward, Shido Itsuka. Who will
you choose today?"
