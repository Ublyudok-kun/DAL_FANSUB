Message	None	"(Just a little while ago, something sad happened.
My beloved pet suddenly disappeared.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked all over the neighborhood, but to no
avail. Where did she go? I wonder if she's doing
okay.)"	
Message	None	(My rabbit, Yoshino.)	
Message	Shido	"Man, I just can't settle down. I'm going to go
look for her again today. She may be at a shelter
somewhere."	
Message	Shido	I wonder who it is. Maybe a customer.	
Message	Shido	Coming!	
Message	Yoshino	Um, excuse me.	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... You are...?	
Message	None	"(I opened the door, and there stood a girl.
I wonder who she is. I've never seen her before.)"	
Message	Shido	"May I help you? I was about to head out. I want to
go look for my pet..."	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san... It's me...	
Message	Shido	"Huh... what about you? Huh? Wait... how do you
know my name?"	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, it's me... It's... Yoshino.	
Message	Shido	Huh...? You're... Yoshino...?	
Message	Shido	WHHHAAAAAAATTTT?!	
Message	Shido	"Tell me, is it really possible for a rabbit to
turn into a human? That's like some kind
of fantasy story."	
Message	None	"(The girl who claimed to be Yoshino was quiet from
the moment I let her in. She didn't really say
anything, and just quietly sat on the sofa."	
Message	Yoshino	...Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well, it's not like I'm doubting you or
anything, but it's also kind of hard for me
to believe."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Man, what is your problem? Yoshino has come to\npay you back. Why are you so cold, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the?! The puppet is talking?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"How rude. I'm not a hand puppet, I'm Yoshinon.\nYoshinon is Yoshino's friend. Nice to meet you,\nShido-kun!"	
Message	None	"(Wh-What the heck? But I guess that part of the
design is the same, huh? Whatever comfort that
is.)"	
Message	Shido	"So, Yoshino and... Yoshinon, right? I'm Shido
Itsuka. Nice to meet you two."	
Message	Yoshino	Nice to... meet you, too.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, you guys know each other already, but\nyou're acting so awkward."	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha... Sorry. So about this whole Yoshino
thing... I can't just take it in."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmm. Well I guess I understand. If only I could\nshow you some kind of proof."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... There is one thing... I can show you...	
Message	Shido	Oh, what is it?	
Message	Yoshino	"I was bitten by a kitty when I was little, and I
have the same scar in the same place..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, that's a good idea to show Shido-kun. I feel\nlike he'll believe you then. Good job, Yoshino!"	
Message	Shido	"A scar from a cat bite, huh? Oh yeah, I guess that
did happen. But where was that scar?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Um... on my butt. But if you want to see it,
Shido-san, I..."	
Message	Shido	"WHOA! Wait a minute. No thanks! You don't have
to take your clothes off! I believe you! I believe
you already!"	
Message	Yoshino	Really?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Isn't that nice, Yoshino?"	
Message	None	"(Phew. I was so close to jail just now. I should
change the subject and talk about something else.)"	
Message	Shido	"So, anyways... About this "paying me back" thing.
What's that all about?"	
Message	Yoshino	"You've always taken care of me, so... I wanted to
pay back the... favor."	
Message	Yoshinon	"And that's why Yoshino came back."	
Message	Shido	"A rabbit's return of a favor...? No, that's a
crane, huh... So then you're going to...
make me some cloth...?"	
Message	Yoshino	Um...!	
Message	Shido	Yes?	
Message	Yoshino	I can't really do anything... Sorry.	
Message	Shido	"I-I guess I don't blame you... And it's not
something to apologize for. But, Yoshino...
Why did you become a human?"	
Message	None	"(I still don't fully believe that she's Yoshino,
though it would be touching if she went to
the trouble of becoming a human to come see me.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Sorry...	
Message	Shido	"I told you, no need to apologize... Don't get so
small like... Oh...!"	
Message	Yoshino	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not a big deal... but I remember the
rabbit Yoshino would always curl up in a ball
on the corner of the sofa like that and sleep."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...? Oh! Yes, I like doing that.	
Message	None	"(For some reason, this melted away my doubts like
snow under the sunlight. This girl is Yoshino.
I feel like I understand now.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I guess it doesn't matter why you became
human. So, what do you plan on doing from
now on?"	
Message	Yoshino	"I... haven't thought about it yet. I was so
focused on paying you back..."	
Message	Shido	Then you can stay with me.	
Message	Yoshino	What...?	
Message	Shido	"You're going to pay me back, right? And it's not
like I'd tell you to leave, either."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun. What do you mean by that? Don't tell\nme you plan on doing inappropriate things to this\nadorable Yoshino?! Paying you back with her body!"	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no! Of course not! I don't care about
favors or anything. I just mean you can stay with
me. I mean... you've always been family, Yoshino."	
Message	Shido	"Since you're family, it's only natural for you to
stay here, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	I... can? I can stay here forever?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, of course. Make yourself comfortable.
Oh... I forgot. Welcome home, Yoshino. I'm glad
you've come back."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... Okay!	
Message	Shido	"Now, there are going to be a lot of problems now
that you're back. I'll need to explain to Kotori."	
Message	Shido	"And if you're going to live here as a human...
There will be lots of issues."	
Message	Shido	Hmm, what do I do?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter, Yoshino?!	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry. I knocked the juice cup over...	
Message	None	"(That's right. Yoshino is a rabbit, despite her
appearance... I should've given her a straw.)"	
Message	None	"(Okay... now I'm in a bind. Yoshino is completely
drenched in juice, and it's fine if she could take
a bath, but...)"	
Message	None	"(Would she even know how to take a bath? If only
Kotori were here. But if we wait for her, Yoshino
might catch a cold... right? I think?)"	
Message	None	"(And this is how we ended up in this situation...
This definitely doesn't look good.)"	
Message	Shido	"Uh, Yoshinon? You probably know how to take a
bath, right?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, Yoshinon is also a former rabbit.\nOf course I don't know how to take a bath."	
Message	Shido	"I don't know why... but I'm not satisfied
with that..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, who cares, Shido-kun?! This is your chance\nto look at the attractive Yoshino's naked body all\nyou want! A lucky pervert's big chance!"	
Message	Shido	"What the?! I-I didn't see it, okay?! I saw
nothing! And what makes you think I'm
a lucky pervert?!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, let's not sweat the details."	
Message	Yoshino	"Sh-Shido-san. The bubbles, the bubbles...! I-I'm
not good at washing my body. Um, please... wash
my body like you usually do.""	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino is a rabbit. Yoshino is a rabbit.
Yoshino... is a rabbit. I'm not touching a
girl. So, calm down... Calm down.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, well... can you turn around? I'll start
with your head, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Okay. Thank you. The bubbles... they're going in
my eyes... Shido-saaaan..."	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Let me wash them off right now!	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, can you wash your own body?	
Message	Yoshino	I-It's difficult...	
Message	Shido	I guess it would be.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, do us a favor and just score already!"	
Choice		Wash her body.	
Choice		Have her do it herself.	
Message	Shido	Argh. I got it! I'll wash it.	
Message	None	"(Damn, I'll do it! I have zero ulterior motives!
I can wash a girl's body without it being weird!)"	
Message	None	"(It's not like I haven't taken a thousand baths
with Kotori before!)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, Yoshino. I'm going to wash your arms first,
so lift them up for me."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay... Thank you, Shido-san.	
Message	None	"(Okay I take it back. Just hearing Yoshino's voice
so close is driving me nuts. And to make things
worse, Yoshino's skin is so smooth and soft.)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, is something the matter, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing. I'm going to wash the other side, too.	
Message	Yoshino	The other side...? So... you want to see my body?	
Message	Shido	"N-No! I'm going to wash your other arm! So lift
your other arm up."	
Message	None	"(Oh, God. I almost saw it. Dear God, please
protect me.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, Shido-kun. There are still parts you haven't\nwashed. What are you going to do? Hey, hey,\nShido-kunnnn."	
Message	None	"(Ngh... I'm a man too. How can I back down from
being egged on like this? I'm going to commit!)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, Yoshino. So this is how you should wash your
whole body. I think you can do the rest yourself.
I'll be in the bathtub, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	What? But...	
Message	Shido	You can do it, right?!	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay!	
Message	None	"(Before giving her any time to respond, I jumped
into the water. Honestly, I was past my limit in
all kinds of ways.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"...Gosh, Shido-kun. You're such a wuss."	
Message	None	"(Say what you will. God, I think I was somehow
able to maintain rationality.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, Yoshino. I'll explain how to wash your
body, so give it a try, okay? Just get the suds
and spread them over your body."	
Message	None	"(No matter if Yoshino's mentally a rabbit, she's
physically a girl. I can't just touch a girl's
body.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"...Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Don't say a word, Yoshinon. I can't hear anything.	
Message	Yoshino	Okay, Shido-san... I'll do it myself.	
Message	Shido	"That-a girl, Yoshino. I can't see your face, but I
know you can do this."	
Message	Yoshino	"Okay, Shido-san. So, um... Please show me. How to
wash myself."	
Message	Shido	...Hm? What did you just say?	
Message	Yoshino	"I'm going to copy how you wash your body, so show
me how you do it, Shido-san."	
Message	None	(U-Um, that imagery is completely inappropriate.)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun. Yoshino's putting herself out there.\nYou can teach her, right?"	
Message	Shido	"*Whimper*... Okay... Then I'll close my eyes, so
Yoshino, look this way."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(If I were to slightly open my eyes, Yoshino would
be right in front of me. Ngh... I can't. Don't
imagine it. Be zen... Just teach her.)"	
Message	Shido	"So, you wash your body like this. When you're
ready to wash the other side, you're going to
hold the sponge on the other hand."	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, Shido-san? I can't hold it on that side
because I have Yoshinon... How can I hold it?"	
Message	None	"(Crap...! I forgot Yoshinon was here. Wh-What do
we do... How am I going to teach her with my eyes
closed.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, teach her. How should she wash the\nother areas?"	
Message	Shido	"I-It's over now. Yoshinon, you know the rest,
right?!"	
Message	None	"(I just blurted it out and ran out of the tub.
...I have to retreat, or I won't last.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh. Fine. Yoshino, Yoshinon will teach you."	
Message	None	"(You can teach her, Yoshinon?! Then what was all
that effort for? ...*sigh*. Whatever. I'm going
to forget all this and just soak in the tub.)"	
Message	Shido	Were you able to wash up, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	"...Scrub, scrub, scrub. Yes, Shido-san. I'm fine.
Bathing... is fun."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it makes you feel refreshed, right?	
Message	Yoshino	"I... would like to go in... with you again
some day."	
Message	Shido	Sorry, um... You'll have to excuse me.	
Message	None	"(*Sigh*... I finished my goal of getting Yoshino
bathed, so I guess I'll get out of the bathroom
soon.)"	
Message	Kotori	I'm home! Dear brother, I'm home!	
Message	None	"(Ah...?! Crap, I totally forgot about Kotori.
Of all the times she could come home?!)"	
Message	None	"(If she sees this, it'll all be over. I can't even
make any excuses at this point.)"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, hide this instant!	
Message	Yoshino	...Hide? But... where?	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Kotori	"Where are you, Onii-chan? You're not in your
room... Oh, I know! Hahaha. You're playing
hide-and-seek!"	
Message	Shido	"...Whoaaaa, there's no place to hide in the
bathroom!"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, I know, the bathroom. It was really hot out
today, so I'll be joining you!"	
Message	Shido	No, Kotori! It's dangerous, don't come in!	
Message	Kotori	Hahah, here I come!	
Message	Shido	Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!	
Message	Kotori	"Oh... Onii-chan, who's that? And why are you in the
bathroom with her?"	
Message	None	"(It's over... No, I'm going to have to take a
chance! I'm going to take a chance on
Kotori having faith in me.)"	
Message	Shido	"U-Um, Kotori. I know you may not be able to
believe me, but hear me out. This girl is Yoshino,
the rabbit."	
Message	Shido	"So, Yoshino turned into a girl... and she came to
pay back a favor. Some stuff happened, and we
ended up in the bath..."	
Message	None	"(Okay, this is not going to work. Not this
explanation.)"	
Message	Kotori	O-O-O-Onii-chan... turned into a pervert!	
Message	Shido	Noooooooooooo!	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(Afterward, Kotori allowed Yoshino to live with
us, but... this incident was something that was
brought up over and over again.)"
