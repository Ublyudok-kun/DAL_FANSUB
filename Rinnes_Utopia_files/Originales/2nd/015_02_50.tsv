Message	Kaguya	"*Grunt*... Another dream... Rather, another
illusion shown to us by the mastermind
of this world."	
Message	Shido	It seems like another unusual date scenario.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Unfortunate. We're back. I wish I was your manager
for just a little longer."	
Message	Shido	"From my point of view, I was suddenly forced to
exercise, so I'm really tired..."	
Message	Kaguya	"Regardless... This kind of strange thing is going
to continue, isn't it?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Deduction. Unless we escape this world, I believe
this type of unpredictable incident will occur at
any time."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe, interesting. To shroud this phantom veil
over the Yamai Sisters. They may be surprised
to find a horrific curse of their own as payback."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Motivated. I don't know what will happen next, but
as long as Kaguya and Yuzuru are together, there
is nothing to be afraid of."	
Message	Shido	Kaguya and Yuzuru seem to be oddly pumped.
