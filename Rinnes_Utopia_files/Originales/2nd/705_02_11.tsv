Message	Shido	"All right. I think I'll go to the cafeteria
today."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Okamine-sensei?	
Message	Tamae	Oh, Itsuka-kun. Do you always eat lunch here?	
Message	Shido	No. I don't come here often.	
Message	Tamae	"I see. I happened to stop by today, I hadn't
realized how many students eat lunch here."	
Message	Shido	Well, it's cheap, and it holds a lot of people.	
Message	Tamae	You're right. This is troubling.	
Message	Shido	What's troubling?	
Message	Tamae	"To be honest, at our staff meeting today, we
discussed getting rid of the cafeteria and just
letting the school shop remain."	
Message	Shido	What, really? I wouldn't want that.	
Message	Shido	"There are plenty of students who stick around
to chat even after they've finished eating."	
Message	Tamae	"Very true. Many students would be disappointed
if it were to be removed."	
Message	Shido	"I think so. Places like this are what make a
school a school."	
Message	Tamae	"Yes, indeed. Then I will oppose the removal.
I will communicate this with the other teachers."	
Message	Shido	Yes, I'd appreciate that.	
Message	Tamae	Okay～.	
Message	None	"(She's a great teacher who really listens to
the concerns of her students.)"
