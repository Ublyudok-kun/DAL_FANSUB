Message	Tohka	Shido! Do you want to join us for a card "geme"?	
Message	Shido	"No, not now. I'm so full, I just want to rest.
You guys have fun."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, I see. That's unfortunate. I'm going to go
play Old Maid!"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, you seem to be having a lot of fun.	
Message	Tohka	It is fun!	
Message	Tohka	 But it's annoying that I can't win at all!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, because you wear your heart on your sleeve.
You need more of a poker face when you play these
kinds of games."	
Message	Tohka	"Pucker" face?	
Message	Shido	"Like Origami, where you don't show your emotions.
You have to make sure people don't know what
you're thinking by looking at your expression."	
Message	Tohka	I see. That's important!	
Message	Shido	"So you have to act like a doll and not show any
emotion, no matter what card you draw."	
Message	Tohka	Okay, I'll give it a shot.	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, Tohka would probably look
really elegant if she remained quiet, but...
that's probably impossible.)"
