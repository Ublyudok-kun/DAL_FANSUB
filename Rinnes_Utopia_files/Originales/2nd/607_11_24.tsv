Message	Shido	"Is Miku not here yet? I wonder if her class went
on long."	
Message	None	"(It's been a few days since I started dating Miku.
She said she wanted to go somewhere after school,
and asked to meet at the front gate, but...)"	
Message	Shido	"Still, it hasn't sunken in for me yet. That the
girl I'm dating was actually an active idol."	
Message	None	"(On top of that, Miku is a popular idol. Everyone
who's anyone knows her... That's just who she
is.)"	
Message	None	"(Still, I know Miku said a while ago to bring on
the press, but the more I think about it, brazenly
meeting up in a place like this might be bad...)"	
Message	Shido	"All right. I'll text her now. We can meet up
somewhere that's secluded and unpopulated."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, sorry to keep you waiting!
It's your angel, Miku～!"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa, whoa! What?
Everything's gone all dark!
And there's something soft on my face!"	
Message	Miku	"Oh, is something wrong?
Is it possible you don't know who it is?
It's Miku, darling! ♪"	
Message	Shido	"Ack, wai—... For now, please let me go.
I-I'm suffocating..."	
Message	Miku	Ah, I'm sorry.	
Message	Shido	*sigh...* That was so sudden. You surprised me.	
Message	Miku	"Goodness, darling. It's so rude of you not
to know when it's your lovely girlfriend."	
Message	Shido	"Well, if someone surprises me with a hug,
then you can't expect me to know who it is
immediately..."	
Message	Miku	"Even・then, a couple should be in tune
with one another!"	
Message	Shido	"I don't get it... Er, more importantly, Miku.
Isn't it kinda dangerous to hug me somewhere
so public?"	
Message	Miku	"Aww, why is that? In fact, I'd rather cling to
you because it's such a public place, darling.
As if to say, "This is the love of my life～!""	
Message	Shido	"Well, you're an idol, so it's better for you
to be careful."	
Message	Miku	"Goodness. Are you my mother or my manager,
darling? You don't need to fuss about that!
More importantly, let's hurry on!"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, Miku, I'm not done talking...
I said, don't link our arms together!
They're looking! People are looking!"	
Message	Miku	Come on, come on. Let's get a move-on already!	
Message	Shido	...Ahh, jeez. I guess it can't be helped.	
Message	None	"(Sometimes, I let Miku do whatever she pleases.
After all, when she smiles so innocently like
that, no man alive would dare resist her.)"	
Message	Shido	"But is it really okay? Having it at my house and
all, I mean, since it's a date."	
Message	Miku	"It's fiiiine. I look forward to relaxing at your
house, darling. Everyone else often goes there,
right?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's true that Tohka frequently drops by
for meals, and lately even Yoshino, Kaguya,
and Yuzuru, too..."	
Message	Miku	Hrmmm...	
Message	Shido	"Erm, they do come over, but they just eat and
leave, you know?"	
Message	Miku	Hmm. Is that so? That's all, huh...? Hm.	
Message	Shido	"Oogh... W-We occasionally play games
together, maybe?"	
Message	Miku	Oooh. That sounds like fun.	
Message	Shido	Um, Miku, are you upset? Possibly.	
Message	Miku	"I'm not upset?
"	
Message	Miku	"There's no point in me being angry over the
fact you met others before me, you know?"	
Message	Shido	Miku...? Could it be... that you're jealous?	
Message	Miku	"Th-That's not true at all!
Goodness, you're such a dummy, darling!"	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry! Today no one else but you will be
there, so you can stay as long as you like."	
Message	Miku	"Then, can you show me... a place that none
of the others have seen before?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? A place nobody else has seen?
Is that..."	
Message	Shido	"...You mean my room, don't you? But I don't
know if anyone's ever seen it."	
Message	Miku	"It's fine. Only the girlfriend should have the
privilege of being invited into the boyfriend's
room, after all."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I suppose that's true. From now on,
that's only your privilege, Miku."	
Message	Miku	Yes!	
Message	None	"(I feel like it's not that big of a deal, but
she seems satisfied, so whatever.)"	
Message	Shido	"Now then, I'll go make some tea.
Go ahead and relax."	
Message	Miku	Okaaaaay. Will do.	
Message	Shido	"...I'm saying this just in case, but don't go
snooping around for anything."	
Message	Miku	"Ohhh. If you don't want me snooping around,
does it mean there's something you don't want
me to find?"	
Message	None	(Oh shoot!)	
Message	Miku	"Hey, darling. What don't you want me to find?
What sort of treasures are you hiding? Hm,
darling?"	
Message	Shido	"Just forget it! Just sit still and relax until
I come back!"	
Message	Miku	But if I sit still, I can't relax.	
Message	Shido	Shut up!	
Message	Shido	"*sigh* I really let that slip... Well, I trust
Miku, so I'm not anxious... or anything."	
Message	None	"(I had a brief moment of doubt, but it was
quickly dismissed.)"	
Message	Shido	"Though, I know it's late, and I'm starting to get
nervous. She's come to hang out at the house.
Kotori's not back either, so it's just us two..."	
Message	Shido	Ack, what am I thinking?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa... H-Hot! O-Oh. It's the phone.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes, hello?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, Shido? What's wrong? You sound out\nof breath."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, it's nothing. I was just boiling some
water..."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm, that's rare. You've brought someone\nhome then, I figure."	
Message	None	(How does she know?! Is my sister psychic?!)	
Message	Shido	I-I haven't brought anyone over.	
Message	Kotori	"Ahahaha. I know that much. Someone as\nuseless as you could never do that."	
Message	None	"(Urgh. Because I answered with a snappy
retort, I can't even say I actually have my
girlfriend over.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, the reason why I called. It doesn't\nlook like I'll be home tonight."	
Message	Shido	Huh, really?	
Message	Kotori	"That's the situation, so I don't need dinner.\nMake sure to lock up before bed."	
Message	Shido	"What am I, a kid? I get it. Take care of
yourself, too."	
Message	Kotori	"Mhmm. See you."	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, Kotori. Thanks for the heads up.
Well, it's fine."	
Message	Shido	"Since she's here anyway, I wonder if Miku
would be happy if I invited her to dine with
me. I'll try asking her."	
Message	Shido	Alright, the tea is done, so...	
Message	Shido	Miku, can I come in...?	
Message	Miku	H-Huh? D-darling? Umm, come in?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, now that I think about it, it's my room.
Well, whatever. Miku, for dinner tonight,
would you like to eat..."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are you doing?!	
Message	None	"(Uh, what's going on here? Is this happening?
N-No, there's no way my girlfriend is naked
with only a dress shirt on!)"	
Message	Miku	Ummm, does it suit me～?	
Message	Shido	"Gah, this really is happening! What are you
doing, Miku?! Is that my school uniform?!"	
Message	None	"(It's the same one I changed out of when
I got home. She must have put it on while
I was making tea.)"	
Message	Miku	"Goodness, darling. You have yet to answer
my question, you know? Your girlfriend is
in such an immodest state, after all!"	
Message	Shido	Ah, er, ummm... You're very pretty, but...	
Message	Miku	"Do you... Do you really think so?
Just how pretty am I?"	
Message	Shido	"Like a "I thought my heart was about to
drop" sort of level? In several different ways."	
Message	Miku	Is that so? How lovely. Charmed, even～	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. That's good.
...I mean!! What on earth are you wearing?!
If someone saw you like this..."	
Message	Miku	Is there anyone else here?	
Message	Shido	No. We're alone, but...	
Message	None	(Wait, why am I answering so honestly?!)	
Message	Miku	"There's no reason to fret. If it's just you and
I here, darling, then there's no worry about
anyone else seeing, right?"	
Message	None	"(No reason to fret? No no no. Calm down,
Shido Itsuka. Don't get caught up in the
situation.)"	
Message	None	"(I just have to be upfront with her. With total
determination. Our relationship just started,
so we can't be doing something... like this.)"	
Message	Shido	Miku!	
Choice		I suppose a little longer couldn't hurt?	
Choice		Let's hurry and change, okay?	
Choice		Have you gotten chubbier?	
Message	Shido	I-I guess a little longer couldn't hurt?	
Message	None	"(Wait, what am I saying?! Wasn't I going to
be upfront with her?)"	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee hee. Oh, darling. The heart knows
what it wants. Just a little longer then, yes?"	
Message	Shido	Augh!	
Message	None	"(I-It's no good. Miku's bewitching words
practically melt my brain. I can't pull my
eyes away...)"	
Message	Shido	"If Miku says so, then a little longer couldn't
hurt..."	
Message	Shido	"No! What I'm saying is that this isn't
good. There's still daylight out. Miku,
put on some clothes!"	
Message	Miku	Whaaat, but why?	
Message	Shido	"Ask all you want, but I'm the one who's
confused here. What's wrong, Miku?"	
Message	Miku	"Umm. Could it possibly be, darling?
Have you grown tired of me?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No, I could never get tired of you.
I just thought this is moving a little
fast for us."	
Message	Miku	"Hmm... If you say so, darling, then it can't
be helped."	
Message	Shido	...Whew.	
Message	None	"(Thank goodness. Looks like it's cleared up
somehow.)"	
Message	Miku	And here I wanted to do a favor for you...	
Message	Shido	I-I see. It's true that I appreciate that, but...	
Message	Miku	You appreciated it? Then I should...	
Message	Shido	"No, I don't mean it like that. I just meant
that I appreciate the sentiment!"	
Message	Miku	Very well. Then I'm happy to hear it.	
Message	Miku	"But I want you to remember this～
You're the only one worthy of this
sight, darling."	
Message	Shido	I'll take it to heart.	
Message	Miku	"Please do. Perhaps if you do, then I could
show you even more..."	
Message	Shido	"W-Waaaugh! For now, I'm going to leave the
room! Get some clothes on in the meantime."	
Message	Miku	"Goodness, darling. Well, it's all part of your
charm."	
Message	Shido	"Miku, maybe you should get some clothes
on... Okay?"	
Message	None	"(I had to muster everything inside of me to
ask her. Willpower, logic, you name it.)"	
Message	Miku	"Um, darling, could it be that you don't
like it? This sort of thing..."	
Message	Shido	"It's not that I don't like it, I just wondered
if something was the matter."	
Message	Miku	Huh? The matter? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"Well, even on the way home, you seemed
lost in thought, so I wondered if there was
something on your mind. So I assumed, at least."	
Message	Miku	"Guess there's no hiding anything from you,
darling."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you...	
Message	Miku	U-Umm. You promise not to laugh if I tell you?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I won't laugh.	
Message	Miku	"I-I wanted to learn more about you, darling...
So..."	
Message	Shido	"You wanted to learn more about me? What does
that have to do with you being undressed?"	
Message	Miku	"I-It's not how it seems. I wanted to flip
through an old photoalbum of yours, but
then your uniform caught my eye."	
Message	Shido	U-Uh huh. And then?	
Message	Miku	"Then, it smelled like you, and so I thought
that if I enveloped myself in your scent, I'd
understand you better, darling."	
Message	Shido	Uh...?	
Message	None	"(I could hear the gears turning in my mind.
This was... possible, but really...?)"	
Message	Miku	I-It's strange, isn't it? Me in this state...	
Message	Shido	"I-It's not strange at all! I feel like I got to
know you a little better, too. Probably..."	
Message	Miku	Really? You're not lying, are you, darling?	
Message	None	(Oogh. She's getting suspicious.)	
Message	Shido	C-Cross my heart.	
Message	None	(After saying this, I pulled Miku into my arms.)	
Message	Miku	...?! U-Um, darling?	
Message	Shido	"It seems like only yesterday that we met, and
now we've started seeing each other. If there's
anything you wanna know, Miku, then I'm here."	
Message	Shido	"Anything at all, Miku, even this...
E-Even my scent."	
Message	Miku	...Okay. This makes me happy, darling.	
Message	Shido	"Are you satisfied now? Why don't you change,
Miku?"	
Message	Miku	Wait, just a little longer...	
Message	Shido	"S-Seriously? N-Not sure how much longer
I'm gonna last..."	
Message	Miku	"Not yet. You said you'd be here, so you need
to hold up your end of the deal."	
Message	Shido	Oogh. I understand.	
Message	None	"(In the end, I ended up holding Miku like
that for another 30 minutes.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Miku.
...Have you gotten a little chubbier?"	
Message	None	"(H-Huh? What the hell am I saying?
I'm so confused that I'm losing my mind.)"	
Message	Miku	"Um, darling? What did you say just now?
I couldn't hear you very well."	
Message	Shido	"Er, ah, well, I just thought that compared to
how I've seen you on TV, you look a little
fluffier."	
Message	Miku	"A little fluffier? How strange. I could have
sworn you said something different just a
second ago, didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	"I-Is that so? You must have misheard me.
Ahahaha..."	
Message	Miku	"How peculiar. So are you saying that the me you
see on TV is more attractive than in reality?"	
Message	Shido	N-No, that's not what I meant at all!	
Message	Miku	"Isn't that strange? There's no possible way
that everyone's favorite idol, Miku Izayoi,
could possibly get chubby."	
Message	Miku	That is positively bizarre, darling.	
Message	Shido	Eeek!	
Message	None	"(Ahhh. Why did I say such a thing? A demon
must've made me say it. That must be it.)"	
Message	Miku	"I think, darling, because of that wicked
thing you said, you're in need of a little
punishment."	
Message	Shido	"Y-You've got it wrong, Miku.
Please, please listen to me!
It's all wroooong!"	
Message	None	"(There are some things that, once said, can
never be taken back. That proved to be my
lesson for the day.)"	
Message	None	"(And so, after all the fuss, Miku and I ended
up having dinner together. Miku helped a bit
with the cooking as well.)"	
Message	Shido	"Good grief. I was wondering why you wanted
to come to my house all of a sudden. Please,
from now on, no funny business like that."	
Message	Miku	Hee hee. Okaaaay.	
Message	Shido	You sure you understand...? Sheesh.	
Message	Miku	"I absolutely do understand. What a treat it
was to spend the day at your house, darling.
Some of this, a bit of that, and you-know-what."	
Message	Shido	"Augh! Just drop that already! Come on. If
we don't eat now, it'll get cold."	
Message	Miku	Darling, won't you say, "aaah"～?	
Message	Shido	P-Please just give it a rest!	
Message	Miku	"Whaaaat? Guess it can't be helped. Then
you owe me one next time, okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Got it... Whatever my girlfriend asks of me,
after all."	
Message	Miku	As expected of darling, I love you.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	None	"(Looks like Miku's got her hold on me from
now on.)"
