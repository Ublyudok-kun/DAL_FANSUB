Message	Shido	The city... What happened here?	
Message	Reine	"Indeed. There appears to be an issue with\nthe city's virtual progression. It is safe to\nassume you are running out of time."	
Message	Maria	"My guess is, Marina is trying to erase this
world. She is no longer trapped within the
cage that imprisoned her."	
Message	Shido	If it disappears, what happens to us...?	
Message	Reine	"...If it disappears while your mind is still\ninside, you will not emerge unscathed. In\nother words, you may never wake again."	
Message	Shido	"There's no mistake. This is a really dangerous
situation, huh? If we stop Marina, we stop its
destruction, right?"	
Message	Reine	"...Yes. If the plan I outlined to you succeeds,\nyou and the others should be able to return\nsafely."	
Message	Shido	"Either way, we can't leave the Fraxinus as
it is. We just have to act here and now, to
protect reality, together!"	
Message	Reine	"...Yes. That is the task ahead of you."	
Message	Maria	I will help as much as I can, as well.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm counting on you, okay?	
Message	Maria	Yes...!	
Message	Kotori	Shido! And Maria, too!	
Message	Shido	"Kotori! Thank goodness. You're safe. About
the situation—"	
Message	Kotori	"Don't worry. I'm aware. Reine, the admin control
status for the Fraxinus hasn't changed, right?"	
Message	Reine	"Yes, it is the same as before. We are missing\n90% of our functionality. We are buying time\nwith a trick, but it won't hold for long."	
Message	Kotori	"Then we'll just have to hurry up. If we
can make it in time, we'll manage."	
Message	Shido	Our destination... The Mother Room.	
Message	Reine	"That's right. It is the core of the digital\nworld. The AI Spirit cannot enter the real world.\nIt is the central control room for the Fraxinus."	
Message	Shido	Will she... really be there?	
Message	Maria	"Do not fear, Shido. Marina Arusu will most
certainly be in the Mother Room."	
Message	Reine	"Maria, can you tell?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Although, it is faint. If I could reconnect
with the system, I could make absolutely sure."	
Message	Reine	"That is far too risky. Maria, we do not know\nif your body will hold."	
Message	Shido	"Don't push yourself, Maria. We're in this
together until the very end."	
Message	Maria	...Yes!	
Message	Reine	"Your powers are necessary for us to stand a\nchance against her, Maria. Only a Spirit's power\ncan resist Marina's influence. That means you."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I am downloading the necessary data,
Reine. I should be able to recreate the Spirit
power in the digital world from the real world."	
Message	Reine	"The roles of the real world do not apply here.\nMarina is in full control of the digital world.\nYour foe is not one person, but a whole realm."	
Message	Shido	"A whole realm... Now that I recall, when I
moved to stop Marina, I couldn't move all
of a sudden."	
Message	Kotori	"Describe that for me in detail. We have little
data about this enemy."	
Message	Shido	"It kinda felt like my brain disconnected
from the rest of me."	
Message	Reine	"...Hmm. Is it similar to Miku's Gabriel?"	
Message	Shido	"This is just a guess, but it felt more akin
to being paralyzed."	
Message	Maria	"It was interfering with the player. Movement
can be intentionally restricted by setting a
flag."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. So we have to think of it like a game.
As expected, while being trapped inside of
a dating sim."	
Message	Shido	"Um, in other words, it's not like Miku's
brainwashing so much as it is altering the
target's ability to move, right?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. In this world, anything is possible. No
matter how powerful you are, parameters
can be shifted, restrictions can be set."	
Message	Shido	I see... Guess it won't be that easy.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. In order to break through, you will
undoubtedly need my help."	
Message	Maria	"Even if I perish, I wish to repay everyone,
most of all you, Shido, for teaching me so
much."	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	Maria	"That is why... you must do whatever you
can to remain steadfast. What I was given,
living in this world..."	
Message	Maria	"I learned things that data alone could never
teach me: feelings, emotions, bonds. They are
invisible but take shape. I love everyone..."	
Message	Shido	"Everyone can feel the sacrifice you're making.
Let's give it our best shot."	
Message	Kotori	"All right. Here we go. Reine, are the others
ready?"	
Message	Reine	"Yes. They have successfully manifested\ntheir Astral Dresses and Angels. I'll transfer\nthe girls over to you."	
Message	Kotori	"Great work. Time to start our mission. Reine,
I leave the Fraxinus to you."	
Message	Reine	"...Aye, leave it to me."	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! Maria! We heard you encountered the
Artificial Spirit on top of the world. Are you
all right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Maria and I are fine.	
Message	Maria	"I apologize, Tohka. All of this happened
because of me."	
Message	Tohka	"What are you saying? There's no need to apologize.
The one at fault is the Artificial Spirit, right?"	
Message	Maria	"However, everyone was needlessly involved
because of me..."	
Message	Tohka	"Do not say that. Because of you, we are able
to fight. In fact, I am grateful you let me in."	
Message	Maria	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami is right. You have provided
an advantage before our battle by bringing
us here."	
Message	Origami	Besides, protecting Shido is our utmost priority.	
Message	Shido	Origami, are you all right?	
Message	Origami	"Of course. Even in this situation, I am more
useful than Tohka Yatogami."	
Message	Tohka	"What did you say?! Bite your tongue,
Origami Tobiichi!"	
Message	Maria	This is no time for allies to bicker...	
Message	Tohka	"Don't worry, Maria. I, and Shido, and
everyone else... are all your friends, and
friends protect one another."	
Message	Origami	"Do not misunderstand. I am fighting for
Shido's sake. But if my powers were secured
because of you, then I am indebted to you."	
Message	Maria	Tohka... Origami... Thank you.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'll do my best... too! Please, do not worry.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aw, man! You're so cool, Yoshino!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's right. Yoshino, we're counting
on you."	
Message	Yoshino	"...Yes. If it's to keep my friends safe, I want
to... do what I can."	
Message	Maria	Thank you, Yoshino. I... feel the same way.	
Message	Kotori	"Right. Besides, like I just said, most of this
world is being controlled by an Artificial Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	"Even with this many Spirits on our side, I don't
know if we can win. We need everyone at full
strength."	
Message	Kotori	"Well then... Let's give it everything we've
got. Maria, you're our last hope."	
Message	Maria	...Okay!	
Message	Miku	"Everyone's huddled together. I don't think
we'll have to worry much. I'll protect both
darling and Maria-chan!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. With you here, Maria, you'll be a huge
help. We're counting on you for support."	
Message	Maria	"I will ask for your support as well. I will
ensure injuries are kept to a minimum."	
Message	Miku	"Yes～. Of course. For darling and a cute
girl, I'll do my best!"	
Message	Kotori	Everyone ready? It's time to head out.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, oh my. Is it possible that you thought
to leave me on house-sitting duty?"	
Message	Kotori	"Of course not. We're going all in, so bring
your firepower. Besides, you always show
up whether or not we call you."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmhmhm. I'm not so sure about that.
However, thanks to all of you, I can have
some long-awaited play time... Kiihihihi!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"So anyways, I'm wondering where the\nheck this Mother Room is?"	
Message	Reine	"...You will most likely have to enter from\nthis crumbling space. It can only be entered\nbecause the world is collapsing."	
Message	Kotori	"Silver linings and all that, huh? Well, guess
we'll just have to do things slow and steady."	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh heh. Our voyage begins, in the
direction of fate's compass, eh? Very well.
Leave this to the Yamai Sisters' leadership."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. Directional instincts are our
forte. We Yamais manipulate the winds, and
can carry everyone with us."	
Message	Kaguya	"Fake world or not, it is a place wherein
I bonded with my dear friends. We won't
allow this vulgar wench to have her way!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Consent. We must do whatever it takes to
end the Artificial Spirit's reign... with
everyone."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You're right. Let's go home together.
You're coming with us, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Yes, of course.	
Message	Kotori	"All right, let's go. There's no telling what
tricks our opponent will use, so stay sharp!
Now, time for the last date!"
