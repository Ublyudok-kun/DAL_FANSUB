Message	Shido	Hello? This is Itsuka.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Oh, Shido-kun? Perfect timing. Kannazuki,\nhere."	
Message	Shido	"Kannazuki-san? What's the matter? You don't
usually call me. Did you want to speak to Kotori?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"No. Today, I wanted to talk to you. You see,\nit's about Kaguya-san and Yuzuru-san."	
Message	Shido	Kaguya and Yuzuru? What happened?	
Message	Kannazuki	"You see, Shido-kun, please stay calm while\nI share this with you."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, what is it? Wait. Don't tell me something
happened to them! Tell me!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes. You see... We are going to do some tests\nsoon."	
Message	Shido	...Tests?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes. Kaguya-san and Yuzuru-san will both\nhave to cooperate. It may take them the\nentire day."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Because they are most stable when they are\ntogether, we are afraid of only taking one. If\nonly one survives, then we want you there."	
Message	None	(I see...)	
Message	Shido	...*sigh*. Okay, got it. I understand.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Wonderful. Please invite them on a date.\nIf you would like, I have a recommendation."	
Message	Shido	No, that's fine.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Aw, your loss. So, which one will participate\nin the test, whom should I ask? Kaguya-san,\nor Yuzuru-san?"	
Message	Shido	Wait, you're letting me decide?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes. I do not mind. I won't tell the other."	
Message	Shido	Well, if that's the case...	
Choice		I want to spend time with Kaguya.	
Choice		I want to spend time with Yuzuru.	
Message	None	"(All things considered, I wanted to spend
time with Kaguya.)"	
Message	Shido	I think she's almost here.	
Message	Shido	Oh, she just made it. Hey, hey.	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe. I've come for you, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Welcome, Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	Oh, uh, thank you for the invitation.	
Message	Shido	"Why do you sound so formal? It's nothing
fancy."	
Message	Kaguya	R-Right... I will enter.	
Message	Shido	"But you're sure you're okay to do this? It's
a date, but we're going to my room. We could
have gone out if you wanted."	
Message	Kaguya	"Huh. Don't worry about it! I've always been
curious about your house, so fear not."	
Message	Shido	Really? If you say so. Kaguya...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hyah! What's the matter?
...Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, you seem restless. You're acting weird.
Just wondering if everything's okay."	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, uh... Er, Yuzuru's not here, and I realized
it's been a while since we've been alone."	
Message	Shido	...I see. Being alone with me makes you nervous.	
Message	Kaguya	"You don't have to put it that way! I-I mean,
who ya callin' nervous, mister?!"	
Message	Shido	It's fine. I'm kinda nervous, too.	
Message	Kaguya	R-Really...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course.	
Message	None	"(But now that she's said it out loud, I'm getting
nervous too. Feeling restless.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, why don't I pour us some black tea? Is
that okay with you?"	
Message	Kaguya	Yeah.	
Message	Shido	Here you go.	
Message	None	(Man...)	
Message	Kaguya	*stare*...	
Message	None	(She's not even blinking. This is uncomfortable.)	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, is something wrong, Kaguya?	
Message	Kaguya	"O-Oh. Fret not, Shido! You're free to pour me
some tea."	
Message	Shido	Gotcha. If you say so.	
Message	Kaguya	"*stare*...
"	
Message	Kaguya	Hehehe...	
Message	None	"(She's a mystery. Oh, well. I'll pretend not
to let it bother me.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay, here's your tea.	
Message	Kaguya	"Kakaka. I sure got you working... Mm.
It's delicious."	
Message	Shido	Cool. Happy to hear it.	
Message	None	(After taking a sip of tea, I finally feel calm.)	
Message	None	"(Normally, there are three of us at a time, so
Yuzuru's silence can be felt.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	What's up?	
Message	Kaguya	Can I sit closer?	
Message	Shido	Sure...	
Message	Kaguya	Yay! Hehe... It's like we're dating.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	None	(I wonder if she's been waiting to ask me that.)	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kaguya? What made you want to come
over?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku. Can't let the cat out of the bag. Maybe
use that big noggin of yours to figure it out."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	None	"(Maybe, she just wanted a relaxing day at
my house.)"	
Message	Kaguya	...! Sh-Shido! That! Is that what I think it is?!	
Message	Shido	"Saying "that" and "it" is confusing me.
You're pointing at my game console. You
know what that is, don't you?"	
Message	Kaguya	"D-Don't make a fool of me. I know! But
I've never laid hands on it myself. Fuooo.
I'd sell my soul for this beautiful machine!"	
Message	None	"(She looks at it like it's a mythical creature.
It's almost hilarious picturing her with a
controller.)"	
Message	Shido	Wanna play, Kaguya?	
Message	Kaguya	Yeah, totally!	
Message	Shido	"Okay, let me start it up. Which game...?
How about a fighting game?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku... Very well. Kuku. Time to take revenge
for our day at the arcade. I'll show you what
I'm made of."	
Message	Shido	"Now, you have to choose your character.
Who do you want to use, Kaguya?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmm... This one. It looks like a bear. I like it.
Gonna crack your skull open."	
Message	Shido	"Y-You sure chose a burly character. I thought
for sure you'd pick a girl."	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku. I'm not like other girls. So...
What about you, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	I'll use this one!	
Message	Kaguya	"Whoa, a fearsome warrior. A challenging test
indeed... But its head is rather strange. Almost
like a pineapp―"	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Not another word. You can decide how
strong it is on the battlefield."	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe. Then, prove your worth to me!	
Message	None	"(And so, we began our game. We still had a
whole date ahead of us, so it wasn't going to
be a full-fledged battle.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"AY! You bastard! I can't perform combos,
Shidooo..."	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay. I'll show you. Okay, use the pad.	
Message	Kaguya	Now's my chance! YAH!	
Message	Shido	Hey! You got the hang of it.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. Pretty easy when your opponent stands
still. Your fault for leaving your guard down."	
Message	Shido	"Rgh... Fine then. I'll send you back to your
homeworld crying."	
Message	Kaguya	"A-Aaaaah! The bear's HP... says otherwise!
I'm kicking. KICKING!"	
Message	Shido	I can't go near you! Aah!	
Message	Kaguya	YAY! I win!	
Message	Shido	Grr... You got me.	
Message	Kaguya	"Kakakaka! The burden of this grudge has
been lifted. Behold, the taste of victory!
Gone are the days of my accursed defeats!"	
Message	None	"(She's as giddy as a schoolgirl. Well, Kaguya's
happiness is all that matters to me.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, one more battle! Next time, I will
scrape you from the bottom of my foot!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, feeling cocky? I won't let my guard down
this time."	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku... I have already mastered this game,
so you're only delaying the inevitable. We
can bet tomorrow's lunch if you'd like."	
Message	Shido	"Ohh, you're on! Sorry, but you're going to
have to buy me a full-course meal at the
cafeteria tomorrow."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hahaha. As if! Shido, get your wallet ready to
buy me every loaf of bread at the store! Even
if it kills you."	
Message	Shido	Bring it on!	
Message	None	"(To no one's surprise, we ended up gaming
all day.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, look at the time. Let's call it.	
Message	Kaguya	"What, already...? But I'm not done with you
yet..."	
Message	Shido	"Well, we still have tomorrow too! Let me walk
you home before it gets dark."	
Message	Kaguya	Okay. Thanks, Shido! Today was sweet.	
Message	Shido	Yeah!	
Message	Kaguya	I look forward to our next meeting.	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Choice		I hope it's just you and me.	
Choice		Next time, let's invite Yuzuru.	
Message	Shido	Let's make it just us again.	
Message	Kaguya	"Very well... Wait, as much as I'd like to say
that, I couldn't exclude Yuzuru."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh, that's not what I meant. I mean,
we're dating, Kaguya. I appreciate our alone
time, too."	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya, you really seemed to enjoy yourself
today. We don't always have to be a trio."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hm... I don't know.
"	
Message	Kaguya	"If you insist, then gimme a call.
I'll be waiting."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kaguya	Nothing! Anyways, thanks for today!	
Message	Shido	Okay. Next time, let's invite Yuzuru.	
Message	Kaguya	"Huh? Oh her, huh.
"	
Message	Kaguya	"But... I don't mind it being you and I from
time to time."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Kaguya, did you just...	
Message	Kaguya	"O-Oh, forget I said that! I'm gonna head home
now! Peace!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kaguya!!	
Message	None	"(I wasn't reading into it too much that day.
I was only thinking of the fact we had a date
without Yuzuru. How was I to know...?)"
