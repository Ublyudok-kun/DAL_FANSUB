Message	None	"(After school, I waited in my classroom for Kurumi to
come back.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi's late...	
Message	Shido	"Uh, the movie's going to start at... Oh, we still have
enough time."	
Message	Shido	"She said she's helping Tama-chan, but maybe I
should have gone with her."	
Message	None	"(Today we have plans to go see the movie we talked
about when she visited my house the other day.)"	
Message	None	"(But Kurumi was asked by the Social Studies teacher―
Tamae Okamine-sensei, also known as Tama-chan―to
help her."	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	Shido	"I feel dumb just sitting around here, so maybe I'll go
check on them to see if I can help."	
Message	None	"(I went to the classroom where she was supposed to
be, but no one was there. Seems like they've already
finished their work. Maybe we just missed each other.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. It's probably just bad timing... I guess I should
go back."	
Message	None	"(I went toward the stairs so I could go back to the
classroom. Just then―)"	
Message	Shido	Huh... Kurumi?	
Message	None	"(I saw someone who looked like Kurumi head toward
the rooftop. Actually... I know it's Kurumi. I guess
I'll go after her.)"	
Message	None	"(I went up to the rooftop and saw Kurumi there,
looking out beyond the fence. She seemed to be
watching the students walk home.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh... Shido-san.	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh. Don't scare me.	
Message	Kurumi	I was worried that you had gone home without me.	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I wanted to go and help you, but seems like we
just missed each other."	
Message	Kurumi	You... wanted to help me?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I figured we'd be able to finish sooner and
leave together."	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess in the end we missed each other.	
Message	Shido	So what were you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	"Well, Okamine-sensei asked me to look for you,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	"Tama-chan did? I wonder what she wanted to talk to
me about."	
Message	None	(I had no idea why she wanted me.)	
Message	Shido	Did she say anything else, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	"All she said was to call you... Come to think of it,
Shido-san... Have you submitted your report?"	
Message	Shido	Report? OH! The social studies one!	
Message	None	"(I finally remembered. That's right. Today was the day
my report was due.)"	
Message	Shido	Aw, man. I totally forgot.	
Message	Kurumi	Don't tell me you haven't touched it.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well I did do it. It's just that I forgot to bring it...
Please believe me."	
Message	Kurumi	"It's pointless whether I believe you or not... But I
think.... Rather, that's definitely what she
was calling you for."	
Message	Shido	Ah, I see. That's not good...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh? What's not good?	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's still early, so I can see her telling me to go
back home to pick it up..."	
Message	Kurumi	"But it is your fault for forgetting, Shido-san. You
can't blame her for telling you that."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but... But I made plans with you...	
Message	None	"(The movie Kurumi said she wanted to see a little
while ago. Today's the last day to see it in theaters.
If we miss it, God knows when we can see it next...)"	
Message	Kurumi	So... I'm the cause of your stress?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Well, um...	
Message	None	(I blushed. I couldn't help but scratch my cheek.)	
Message	Shido	"If I miss the chance today, we won't be able to see
the movie, right? We don't even know when it'll be out
to buy later..."	
Message	Kurumi	So what do you plan on doing?	
Message	Shido	"...I feel bad for Tama-chan, but I'm going to submit
my report tomorrow."	
Message	None	"(It's not like I didn't do it. I'm sure she'll forgive
me if I submit it tomorrow.)"	
Message	Shido	"...So I'm sorry, but can you tell Okamine-sensei that
I've already gone home?"	
Message	None	(Kurumi seemed to contemplate the idea for a moment.)	
Message	Kurumi	...Very well. You just leave it to me.	
Message	None	(She spoke with her usual bright smile.)	
Message	Shido	Thanks! All right, let's move on then!	
Message	Shido	"First, I'm going to go get my bag from the classroom.
I figured it'd be in the way, so I left it behind. The
movie tickets are still in there..."	
Message	Kurumi	Got it. It's on my way, so I'll go with you.	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's go, then.	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, what did she ask you to help her
with, Kurumi?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Organizing the worksheets for the next class. It was
pretty heavy, so she must have wanted help."	
Message	Shido	Ah, makes sense. You're the class president, huh.	
Message	None	(Kurumi suddenly stopped.)	
Message	Shido	Kurumi? What's the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	Shhh. Quiet, Shido-san... Do you hear that?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	"(I listened carefully. I heard a familiar voice coming
from the hallway.)"	
Message	Tamae	Uuuum. Have you seen Tokisaki-san or Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Tamae	I seee. Thank you～	
Message	Shido	...That voice!	
Message	None	"(Speak of the devil. The owner of the voice was
Tama-chan, a.k.a. Okamine-sensei.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, hurry.	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi and I nodded at one another and turned
around, running back the other way.)"	
Message	Kurumi	What are you going to do?	
Message	Shido	"...First, let's go downstairs and take the long way
around to the classroom."	
Message	Kurumi	Got it.	
Message	None	"(We looked around and went down the lower hallway.
We managed to find a way into the classroom.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. Seems like we beat her here.	
Message	Kurumi	"Come to think of it, I came with you... but I could
have bought some time earlier, couldn't I?"	
Message	Shido	No point in thinking about that now. Anyways, hang on.	
Message	None	"(I went straight to my desk, but... For some reason,
my bag was missing.)"	
Message	Shido	What the...	
Message	Kurumi	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	My bag is gone...	
Message	Kurumi	Huh?	
Message	None	"(I looked around, but I couldn't find my bag
anywhere.)"	
Message	Shido	Of all times...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, over here.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi was moving toward the blackboard. I followed
her and saw my bag there with a note.)"	
Message	Shido	"What's this? ""Shido forgot his bag, so someone either take it
to him, or please let him know about it.―Tonomachi."	
Message	Shido	Ah, damn it, Tonomachi. You scared me...	
Message	None	"(I'm sure he did it for my benefit, but... Gosh, he
didn't have to do that...)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, well. I found my bag, so let's hurry up and go.	
Message	None	(Just then Kurumi raised her hand to stop me.)	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, what's the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san... No. ...She's coming!	
Message	Shido	Huh? O-Oh, no...!	
Message	None	"(I listened carefully and heard a familiar voice
approaching.)"	
Message	Tamae	Tokisaki-saaaaaan. Itsuka-kuuuun?	
Message	Tamae	Are you guys around here～? I need to talk to you～	
Message	Shido	...This isn't good.	
Message	None	"(I heard Okamine-sensei's footsteps coming straight
toward us. Even though I managed to get ahold of my
bag, we were still going to get caught at this rate.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san. What do you want to do? If she comes in
here, we'll get caught."	
Message	Shido	*grunt*. I can't leave the classroom now...	
Message	None	(I―)	
Choice		There's no use... Let's give up.	
Choice		Kurumi, help me!	
Message	None	"(It's too late to run and hide at this point. The
situation was dire.)"	
Message	Shido	...Let's give up.	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san?	
Message	None	"(Knowing Okamine-sensei, she may just wait until
tomorrow if I asked. I decided to just give in.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's pointless. There's nowhere to hide in here, and I
can't exactly run for it."	
Message	Kurumi	―Huh?	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry... But we're going to have to give up.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi. I'm so sor...	
Message	None	"(I looked down. Okamine-sensei's footsteps were
getting louder and louder.)"	
Message	None	"(I had already given up, but Kurumi's powerful voice
resounded in my ears.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...That's not like you, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	There's still a place to hide.	
Message	Kurumi	So please don't give up.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	None	"(Hearing her powerful words, I decided to take a
chance. The sparkle in my eyes returned, and I wanted
to hear Kurumi's thoughts.)"	
Message	Shido	Got it. But there's no place to hide. Or is there?	
Message	Kurumi	That would be... here.	
Message	Shido	W-Whoaaaa!	
Message	None	"(Before I could answer, Kurumi yanked my arm and
shoved me under the teacher's podium.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, what are you... GAH!	
Message	None	"(Kurumi sandwiched my face with something soft,
covered my head with something, and closed off the
bottom of the podium.)"	
Message	Shido	*grunt*... What's going on?	
Message	Kurumi	Sh-Shido-san, don't move!	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi? What's going on―	
Message	Kurumi	HYAHH! S-Stop. It tickles.	
Message	Shido	...Huh?!	
Message	None	"(Judging by our back-and-forth, I had a hunch about
what was going on.)"	
Message	None	"(Basically this is the only thing that could be done
now. Then that means―)"	
Message	Kurumi	Ah... Shido-san, please. Don't breathe too hard.	
Message	Kurumi	Your breath... It tickles my legs.	
Message	Shido	B-But...	
Message	Kurumi	AH! ...Shido-san, are you... doing it on purpose?	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's not like that! I...	
Message	Kurumi	Hya...?! Gosh!	
Message	None	"(Her soft flesh. Her sweet scent. Her moist, warm
skin. And Kurumi's sweet sighs. Every time I heard
them, my heart rang like a bell.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Kurumi? I don't think this will cut it...	
Message	Kurumi	"Ahh... Please hang in there... until we can get rid
of... O-Okamine-sensei."	
Message	Kurumi	I... will... mm... endure it...	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(So we maintained that position for a little while
as Okamine-sensei neared.)"	
Message	Shido	Is she here?	
Message	Kurumi	"No. It seems as though sh-she's standing in front of
the classroom."	
Message	Kurumi	"I think she's... hah...! She's responding to a text
message."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Th-Then maybe we can adjust our position―	
Message	Kurumi	He... Shido-san, don't move!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but it's hard to breathe―	
Message	Kurumi	HYAAAAA...!	
Message	Shido	Whoa. I-I'm sorry!	
Message	Kurumi	"No... Don't talk... Shido-san, your breath is on my
thighs―"	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(The more I moved or panicked, the more Kurumi's body
squirmed, and her sweet moans escaped her mouth
involuntarily.)"	
Message	None	"(Even if I made the slightest movement or talked
just a little, it stimulated her... I don't know what else
I can do.)"	
Message	None	(As my mind went blank, the split second that felt like a lifetime passed.)	
Message	Kurumi	I think we're safe now.	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. She seems to be gone.	
Message	Shido	Phew... We're saved.	
Message	Kurumi	"Sh-Sh-Sh-Shido-san?! P-Please... if you're going to
talk, please do so after you get out from under there!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay! So―	
Message	Kurumi	...?!	
Message	None	"(I crawled out from under the podium. Kurumi shot me
a tough look, but... she and I managed to make it out
of our bind.)"	
Message	None	"(It was too late to run or hide. The situation was
dire.)"	
Message	Shido	...*grunt*.	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san?	
Message	None	"(But if I give up here, then my plans to see the movie
with Kurumi would be ruined. This was all for Kurumi.
She was so excited to watch it.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm sure there's still a way. I... won't give up
yet!)"	
Message	Shido	Let's calm down. There has to be a way somehow.	
Message	Kurumi	A way... Do you have any ideas?	
Message	None	"(I looked around. I needed to find some place to
hide.)"	
Message	Shido	If I just hide, we should be able to get away with it!	
Message	Shido	We need to find a hiding place...	
Message	None	"(The only place I could hide in the classroom would
be in the storage locker or the teacher's podium.)"	
Message	Shido	The podium... That's it!	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Kurumi. Help me!	
Message	Kurumi	Help you... What do you want me to do?	
Message	Shido	"I'm going to hide under the podium, so I want you to
close it off with your legs and block me from the
teacher's view."	
Message	Kurumi	―!	
Message	None	(When I said that, Kurumi gave a naughty smile.)	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	My, my. Very well, then.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	I was just thinking the same thing.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Then I don't have to explain anything! Thanks,
Kurumi!"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Understood.	
Message	None	"(After I nodded, I grabbed my bag and I hid under the
podium.)"	
Message	Shido	All right, Kurumi, hurry!	
Message	None	"(All Kurumi had to do was stand there and let me
hide―)"	
Message	Kurumi	Excuse me, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Huh... WHOA?!	
Message	None	"(Suddenly my vision went dark. I felt something soft
smush into my face.)"	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi? What's―	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Don't move.	
Message	Shido	What are you doing―	
Message	Kurumi	Quiet. Okamine-sensei is almost here...	
Message	None	"(Just then, the door opened. My breath caught in my
throat.)"	
Message	Tamae	Oh, there you are, Tokisaki-san.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Okamine-sensei.	
Message	Tamae	What are you doing there?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. I was just looking something up.	
Message	None	"(My cheeks were pressed against something unbelievably
soft. A lovely scent. Kurumi's body heat. I could feel
it on my cheeks and shoulders.)"	
Message	Shido	～!	
Message	None	"(I don't know if Kurumi knew what was going through
my mind, but she kept on talking with Okamine-sensei.)"	
Message	Tamae	Sooo, were you able to find Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm sorry. It seems by the time I started searching
for him, he had already gone home."	
Message	None	"(It was getting hard for me to breathe, so I listened
in to find the right opportunity to try and move my
head.)"	
Message	Kurumi	If I can find h―	
Message	Kurumi	HYAH!	
Message	None	(Just then, Kurumi's body jolted mid-sentence.)	
Message	Tamae	Tokisaki-san? Is something the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	N-Nothing! I thought I felt something touch my face.	
Message	None	(I could hear a trace of panic in Kurumi's voice.)	
Message	Tamae	A-As long as you're okay...	
Message	Tamae	Right, Tokisaki-san. So about Itsuka-kun earlier―	
Message	None	(Hearing my name, I froze.)	
Message	Kurumi	Oh... Y-Yes.	
Message	Tamae	T-Tokisaki-san? What's the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	N-Nothing is the matter... I promise.	
Message	Tamae	Really?	
Message	None	"(Seems like whenever I moved, I was inadvertently
stimulating Kurumi. S-Sorry, Kurumi.)"	
Message	Tamae	Tokisaki-san, don't tell me...	
Message	None	"(Crap. Did she catch us?! I tried to stay quiet, but
the situation made me breathe even more heavily.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Hya... Hauu!	
Message	Tamae	Could you be... sick?	
Message	Kurumi	"Mmm. Yes... that's right. My body... is just... isn't
feeling well."	
Message	None	"(Every time I tried to breathe in from between her
thighs, Kurumi's body quivered, and the sweet anguish
I could hear in her voice made my mind go numb.)"	
Message	Tamae	That's not good! You need to go home immediately!	
Message	Kurumi	"No. There's something I still have to do here. So when
I'm finished with that..."	
Message	Tamae	If it's something for school, then I'll just...	
Message	Kurumi	"N-No, I'm fine! I want to do the job with which I was
tasked as class president."	
Message	None	"(I finally got some air in, and realized that Kurumi
had lost her composure. This was far from her usual
behavior.)"	
Message	Tamae	"Is that so? Then, you take care of yourself and hurry
home, okay?"	
Message	Tamae	"Oh, and if you have a chance to see Itsuka-kun, then
please tell him to bring his report tomorrow, okay?"	
Message	Kurumi	...Understood. Good-bye, Okamine-sensei...	
Message	None	"(And so we were able to avoid any trouble. Well..
afterwards Kurumi straight up scolded me.)"	
Message	Shido	That was a lot more fun than I thought.	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. It was very good.	
Message	None	"(We safely got out of the school, and as planned,
we went to see the movie together.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh... Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	What is it?	
Message	Shido	Um... Thanks for today.	
Message	Kurumi	No problem. I'm glad I could be of use.	
Message	Shido	You always help me out.	
Message	Kurumi	But today... You've gone too far.	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	Therefore... Why don't we say you owe me one for now?	
Message	Shido	Okay. Well, I guess you have a point.	
Message	None	"(Even Kurumi was tossed around today... And it was
all my fault.)"	
Message	Shido	...Kurumi, you're adorable.	
Message	Kurumi	Excuse me...? Could you say that again?	
Message	Shido	Nothing. Thanks for today, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh, Shido-san. You always play it off like that...	
Message	None	(And we slowly began the walk home.)
