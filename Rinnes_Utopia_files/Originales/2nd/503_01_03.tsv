Message	Shido	Hey... This is...	
Message	Shido	My room. I guess I fell asleep.	
Message	Shido	"*Yawn*... Okay, I don't remember what I was doing
before I fell asleep."	
Message	Shido	I feel like I had to do something.	
Message	None	"(I can't remember. Well, it must not be very
important then.)"	
Message	None	"(I've been busy lately and it feels like my room
is a bit messy. I'd better clean it up later...
but...)"	
Message	Shido	...Not today. I'll do it tomorrow...	
Message	Shido	"Hm? I heard footsteps... Could it be Kotori?
Or maybe Tohka's come to visit."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido...!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, what is it? You're here out of the blue. Is
something wrong?"	
Message	Yoshino	Don't... "is something wrong" me!	
Message	Shido	...Excuse me?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido... what is... the meaning of this...?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean? What are you talking about?	
Message	Yoshino	"Your clothes are everywhere, food scraps are
everywhere... Are you serious right now?!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, well, this is...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuuun. This doesn't look good. Even if\nYoshino isn't usually around the house."	
Message	Yoshinon	"She takes her eyes off you one second, and you go\nand live such a lazy life? Yoshinon can't cover\nfor you this time."	
Message	Shido	Eyes off of me for one second...? Oh, I see...	
Message	None	"(...That's right. Despite her young appearance,
Yoshino attends college nearby. She's my older
sister.)"	
Message	None	"(Normally she lives alone in the next town over,
but she comes by to check in on me from time to
time, along with her friend Yoshinon.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Yoshino and Yoshinon. I was so busy and got
lazy..."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?!	
Message	Yoshino	*Whimper*...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it, Yoshino?	
Message	None	"(Yoshino is glaring at me and trying to tell me
something. I know that much. But... what is it?
What does she want to say?)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshinon? What does Yoshino want to say?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Seriously? You're going to ask me that?"	
Message	Yoshino	Grr...	
Message	None	"(I can tell she's mad, but I have no idea why. I
don't think it's just because the room is messy.)"	
Message	Yoshino	MMM! MMMMM!	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I give up. Please tell me, Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	"*Sigh*... Fine, Shido-kun. I'll let you in on it\nthis time. Yoshino probably wants you to call\nher O..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, ohhh! I get it.	
Message	Yoshino	Hmph... Shido, you idiot.	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Yoshino. I mean Yoshino-oneechan.	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... Okay, okay! I am Shido's onee-chan...!	
Message	None	(Glad she's in a better mood.)	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry for being late. Welcome home, onee-chan
and Yoshinon."	
Message	Shido	All right, I'm going to go clean my room, then.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino-oneechan is eyeing me... But she doesn't
have to keep watch. I won't slack off.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'm going to clean my room now, so why don't
you rest in the living room, Ne-chan...?"	
Message	Yoshino	Grr...!	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(She's trying to tell me something again. P-Please
just tell me... She is so shy sometimes...)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Yoshinon... help me!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun... You need to think a little. I think\nYoshino wants to help you."	
Message	Shido	Really?	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes! I do.	
Message	Shido	"I see. But... It's not messy to the point where
I'd need help."	
Message	Shido	"It's nice of you to offer, but I can do this on my
own. Just go ahead and rest..."	
Message	Yoshino	I want to clean with you, Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Well, if you say so. But... Yoshino... I mean,
Yoshino-oneechan. Aren't you tired?
You just got back, didn't you?"	
Message	Yoshino	*Whine*...	
Message	Shido	Oh, your brows are furrowed again. Um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, Shido-kun. Let me tell you a secret. Yoshino\nwants to take care of you. You are her precious,\nprecious little brother."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I get it. Haha. Onee-chan, you're so
overprotective."	
Message	Yoshino	Awww...?! Um, Shido... Am I annoying you...?	
Message	Shido	O-O-Of course not! I'd love for you to help!	
Message	None	(And so we started to clean up together.)	
Message	Shido	Let's clean then.	
Message	Shido	Here I go.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido, that way...	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	Yoshino	And here.	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuuun. Your clothes are messy here, too."	
Message	Shido	Got it!	
Message	None	"(And that went on for a while. Since she's
watching me from behind, I noticed I had
straightened my posture as well.)"	
Message	None	"(But, does this really count as her helping me?
*peek*...)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, seems like Yoshino-oneechan feels like
something's off, too.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshinon is eyeing me. I think Yoshino wants to
participate more.)"	
Message	None	(Hm. What to do...)	
Choice		Oh, I'll have her cheer me on.	
Choice		Do something stupid.	
Message	None	(I guess I'll take the bullet.)	
Message	Shido	"Man, I am so tired. I'm halfway through, but my
body won't move anymore. *peek*...!"	
Message	None	"(Seems like my acting was a bit fake, but oh well.
It's for Yoshino-oneechan.)"	
Message	Yoshino	"Sh-Shido, you can't! We're almost there... so hang
in there."	
Message	Shido	"I want to, but I can't. I-If only someone could
cheer me on...*peek*!"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(No, she doesn't get it! Yoshino-oneechan seems
dumbfounded! Please get the hint. Your little
brother needs you!)"	
Message	Shido	If only someone cheered me on!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino? I think Shido-kun's out of batteries."	
Message	Yoshino	He needs an energy charge?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Exactly. If the adorable Yoshino cheers him on,\nI'm sure it'll be a miracle charge to Shido-kun's\npower, and he'll clean better!"	
Message	None	"(Good job, Yoshinon! Gonna give you an internal
thumbs up. I feel like Yoshinon is nodding back in
response.)"	
Message	Yoshino	G-Got it. It's for you, Shido...	
Message	Yoshino	...Ahem. Go... Go... Shido!	
Message	None	"(Her voice is like a mosquito's. Maybe she got
embarrassed.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's no good, Yoshino. Shido-kun won't be\nenergized by that! You need to be louder and\nmore enthusiastic!"	
Message	Yoshino	Go, fight, win! Shido!	
Message	None	"(Oh, her voice is getting louder. And that kinda
makes me happy. It's nice to have a girl cheer
you on.)"	
Message	Yoshino	You think you can do better now, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Ah... N-Not yet... I still need more... just
a little more energy."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino... You have to be able to say..."	
Message	None	"(Wh-What is going on, Yoshinon? What did you tell
her? She seems super embarrassed. What's going to
happen now...)"	
Message	Yoshino	"G-Good luck, Shido. Onee-chan loves Shido for trying
his best."	
Message	Yoshino	I super-duper love Shido for trying his best!	
Message	None	"(Wow! I have no choice but to commit now. I can't
let her cheer go to waste!)"	
Message	Shido	Let's get this over with!	
Message	None	"(Seems like my plan worked. I started cleaning
like crazy again.)"	
Message	None	"(Okay. I'm going to change it up. If I clean it all
up myself, then we can't do it together. What
should I do?)"	
Message	None	"(I have to do something weird that I wouldn't do
normally. That way, Yoshino-oneechan will scold
me... I'll act dumb and have her fix me!)"	
Message	None	"(...That might be tricky. For now, I'll let
Yoshinon in on my idea. I'm sure she'll get it.)"	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon, Yoshinon.	
Message	None	*Squint*...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmm...? *gasp*!"	
Message	None	"(All right, the eye contact worked. I don't know
how she did it, but good job, Yoshinon. So...
here I go. Just watch Shido Itsuka act dumb!)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, how weird. No matter how much I wipe the
floor, it won't get cleaner."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...? What's the matter?	
Message	None	"(Damn, did that sound so genuine that she didn't
get it?)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino! You have to direct Shido-kun. You're\nhis older sister."	
Message	Yoshino	Ah, that's right. Okay... I'll do my best...	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido, you're not using the rag. It's on top of
your head!"	
Message	Shido	"Ohhhh, there it is. Maybe it slipped while I was
sleeping."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido, the rag's not your glasses.	
Message	None	"(All right. Seems like Yoshino-oneechan is getting
the hang of it. I actually look pretty dumb now,
but I did go all out... I'm going to keep it up!)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm, the vacuum isn't turning on.	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido, that's a planter. The vacuum is...
this one."	
Message	Shido	How weird. It's not turning on!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido, it's not plugged in.	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant, pant*...	
Message	None	"(I think I did pretty well. Despite going around
in circles, I finally cleaned my room. It made
me twice as tired, though...)"	
Message	Shido	"This is the end. Yoshino-oneechan, please tell me
if there are any issues."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino, I think you're not done under the\nbeddd."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido, you have... forgotten under the bed!	
Message	Shido	"Got it. Under the bed, huh? There's a magazine...
C-Crap!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"My, myyy, Shido-kun. You hid something there,\ndidn't you? Looks like a magazine. You have to put\nit on the bookshelf where it belongs."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido... Please clean!	
Message	Shido	"Y-You've betrayed me, Yoshinon! I thought you were
my ally...!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hm, I have no idea what you're talking about.\nYoshino, seems like Shido-kun has a naughty\nmagazine."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido! Th-That is not acceptable!	
Message	Shido	F-Forgive me, onee-chan!	
Message	None	"(Yoshino-oneechan gave me a judgmental look for a
little while.)"	
Message	Shido	Phew. I'm mostly done, all thanks to you.	
Message	Yoshino	You're... welcome...	
Message	Yoshino	Good job, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"You're going to spend the night, right? I'll cook
something delicious today to show my appreciation.
Just you wait."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido... Your cooking is delicious.	
Message	Shido	"But, it's too early for food... I know, why don't
we eat some ice cream?"	
Message	Yoshino	...! Shido, that's a good idea.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, get me one too."	
Message	Shido	All right, got it!	
Message	None	"(Yoshino-oneechan has a tendency to be childish,
but she's an awesome sister, always caring about
her brother. I'm lucky to have her.)"
