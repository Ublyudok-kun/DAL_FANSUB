Message	None	"(After Arusu said she would make contact, she
became unresponsive for a little while.)"	
Message	Shido	Heeey, Arusu?	
Message	Arusu	...Access verified.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Access?	
Message	Kotori	There he is! Shido, get away from her!	
Message	Shido	"That voice... Kotori?! What do you mean, get
away... Hey, wait a minute! What's going on?!"	
Message	Kotori	"She's dangerous. The game's gone bonkers, all
because of her. Not to mention she called us in
here."	
Message	Tohka	Shido! We came to save you from the "geme"!	
Message	Kurumi	My, my, it sure is pretty rowdy from the get-go.	
Message	Origami	"If you're going to hurt Shido, you won't get away
with it."	
Message	Shido	"Tohka... Origami... Kurumi, too...?! You guys came
to save me? What do you mean? I wasn't in
danger..."	
Message	Yoshino	"Sh-Shido-san, you are stuck in the game.
I-It's... her fault."	
Message	Shido	"Arusu's fault...? Really? Oh, come to think of it,
I couldn't get a hold of you, Kotori, or Reine-san
either..."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, that's totally like you. But no matter
how cute she is, she's our enemy. I think you
should get away from her～"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, come here. It would be wise for you to hide
behind me."	
Message	Tohka	"What are you talking about, Origami Tobiichi?!
I'm going to protect Shido! You come behind me!"	
Message	Kurumi	"I see... So she's the AI Spirit you mentioned.
How adorable."	
Message	Shido	AI Spirit...?	
Message	Arusu	AI... Spirit...? What are you speaking of?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehehe... No point in playing dumb, you fake
Spirit! You've called us forth by taking Shido
hostage... You can't get away from us now!"	
Message	Arusu	"Hostage... To detain with the goal of gaining
something in return... I will deny that. I haven't
taken Shido Itsuka hostage at all."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. For someone like you who has absolute
rule over this virtual world, Shido is nothing
more than a hostage."	
Message	Arusu	"I haven't used any of my restrictions against
Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Kotori	"What do you mean? I thought you told us to...
Anyways, you called us here, didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, Arusu... You did mention
some kind of search earlier."	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. In order to find out what love is, I did
conduct a search. I called for personnel
who could love you."	
Message	Shido	"So everyone here... They're not NPCs like the ones
I bumped into earlier, but the real ones... right?"	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. All of us. Our names
were all listed."	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. In this world, you guys will grow in love
with Shido Itsuka. You all were set as prospects."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Arusu	"They were set from the beginning of this world
as attainable characters."	
Message	Arusu	"That's why I called for them. The people that
Shido Itsuka can love, and who could love back."	
Message	Shido	Love and love back...	
Message	Kotori	"I'm telling you now, it's not like that. The
sooner you wake up from this nonsense,
the sooner I can get back to work."	
Message	Arusu	Then... Kotori Itsuka doesn't love Shido Itsuka?	
Message	Kotori	"W-Well...!
"	
Message	Kotori	"A-As his little sister... Er, as his family...
"	
Message	Kotori	Love... um...	
Message	Arusu	Then Kotori Itsuka, let me ask you. What is love?	
Message	Shido	"Arusu seems to want an answer. She really wants
to know what love is..."	
Message	Shido	"I thought about it, but it's so hard to define,
you know? I feel like I know what it is, but when
I try to put it into words... it's really tough."	
Message	Kotori	Right...	
Message	None	"(Kotori looks like she wants to say something, but
can't...)"	
Message	Arusu	How about the others? What is love for you all?	
Message	Arusu	"Those of you who love Shido Itsuka, do you know
what love is? What kind of thing is love?"	
Message	Tohka	"I don't know what love is really, but I like to be
with Shido. It's fun! And besides, he always gives
me yummy food!"	
Message	Shido	"Tohka... Is my value the same as a
vending machine?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Um... F-For example, if you think about that
person, your heart pounds and... feels warm..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hahaaa. Yoshino, you're always lying in bed,\nbright red and thinking about Shido-kun!"	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Arusu	"So, there is a temperature change? And an
expression of happiness? However, can you not
obtain that from something other than love?"	
Message	Yoshino	"...Oh... That may be true. But it's different...
from other feelings... I think..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Isn't it the feeling of wanting the person for
yourself? Both body and heart melting and fusing
together into one..."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wouldn't you say that's too soon for a
healthy high school relationship?!"	
Message	Kotori	W-Well, you may have a point...	
Message	Shido	"How can you understand what she's talking
about...? What's your answer?"	
Message	Kotori	"W-Well... You put a leash on them and step on them
and have some fun...?"	
Message	Shido	"Why did you grow up so quickly...
Ahh, come back Kotori... My
adorable little sister..."	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What?! You're so dumb!	
Message	Arusu	"Then... Kaguya and Yuzuru Yamai...
How about you two?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Love, huh? Love is a chance meeting of
fate. With each part of one soul that is forbidden
from being separated."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Attention. You must be talking about Yuzuru.
But what this person is asking about is Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	"What... My love for Shido... What I want... uh...
My possession?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, just like me, then? Kaguya-san, you want to
become one with Shido-san too?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Sh-Sh-Sh-Shido... become one...?
Wh-Wh-Wh-What, um... Yuzuru, how about you?"	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, I'm sad that I can't hear your answer.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Answer. It is prioritizing another before
yourself."	
Message	None	"(That's a simple answer. Well, I can understand
why Yuzuru would say that. Kaguya and Yuzuru
do that for each other.)"	
Message	None	"(But that wasn't the case back then, so... it
feels a little different.)"	
Message	Miku	"Darling said no matter what happened, he'd be
my fan. That means you're always thinking of me,
right?"	
Message	Arusu	"Fan. A supporter you mean? So it means you
support or feel loyalty toward them? Is that love?"	
Message	Miku	"Wh-When you put it that way, I feel like it's a
little different."	
Message	Origami	To take in everything they want is love.	
Message	Kurumi	That sure sounds one-sided.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah! Everyone has different answers!"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... I don't know if it's something that has a
uniform answer. Arusu, what do you say?"	
Message	Arusu	"...Judging from the information I have collected
until now, I believe it is difficult to understand
love."	
Message	Shido	Well... It feels like the expected conclusion.	
Message	Arusu	"So then, I must simulate love and watch it grow...
That seems to be the only way to verify
what it is."	
Message	Arusu	"The reason why I had you all come here is because
I was considering it. This world has many events
by which to grow love."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, you've come to the right place. So, you're
telling me you don't plan on letting us out unless
we play along?"	
Message	Arusu	...What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm asking if we're stuck here until you
understand what love is."	
Message	Arusu	...? I don't understand your question.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait a minute, Kotori. Arusu... You didn't
intend on trapping us in here?"	
Message	Arusu	I just have one goal. To know what love is.	
Message	Kotori	"But... your existence is an anomaly. You shouldn't
exist as a character."	
Message	Kotori	If this isn't your doing, then whose is it?	
Message	Arusu	"...I do not know. I do not understand
every system."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kotori...? She really doesn't seem to know.
No point in getting mad at her."	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, Shido, you're always so... Well, I guess we
can't help it. She's our only hope now."	
Message	Kurumi	"You're right... Arusu-san, was it?
What should we do?"	
Message	Arusu	"To form and grow love in this world with Shido
Itsuka. That is all I wish for."	
Message	Miku	"In other words, it's no different from usual.
If I can spend some sweet time with my darling,
it's all good!"	
Message	Kotori	"I'm glad that time's sped up in virtual reality.
Even if we're trapped here for a few days, it'll
only be a few hours outside."	
Message	Tohka	"Wait, Kotori! Does this mean we can't eat for
days?! That's not good!"	
Message	Kotori	"You can eat in this world. So deal with it here.
Shido will cook."	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, you say that without asking me... but
whatever, I don't mind. So, in the end, we're
supposed to live an ordinary life here?"	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. And the rest, this world should
push you further."	
Message	Kotori	"...*Sigh* I guess we have no choice but to go
along with it for a little while."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Well I guess I can use this opportunity to
gain an advantage over the others."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. The time to grow in love with Shido
is limited. We must strike first."	
Message	Shido	You guys, can you please take it easy...?
