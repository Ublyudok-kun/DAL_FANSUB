Message	Shido	"I see. Karaoke, huh? Didn't expect this.
You like karaoke, Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"I also wished to try singing together with
you, Shido."	
Message	None	"(Hm? What does she mean by "also"? Does
she mean like regular students?)"	
Message	Maria	Now then, Shido. Let us try singing.	
Message	Shido	Right. Um...	
Message	None	(Maria wasn't browsing though the songlist...)	
Message	Shido	"Maria, just to confirm, you know what to do
at karaoke, right?"	
Message	Maria	"Of course. You choose a song with this small
device. When it travels to the main device,
your selection will play."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, so you do know. Then, if you have a song
in mind, you're free to input it."	
Message	Maria	"I have records of songs you've sung previously
with your friends, but choosing one myself
is rather difficult."	
Message	Shido	"Songs I've sung previously? But this is our
first time together at karaoke, isn't it, Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"Ah... Um, yes. Um...
I meant from past data."	
Message	Shido	Ohh, I see.	
Message	None	"(Now that she mentions it, we are inside
of a game created by Ratatoskr. Guess it's
not weird that she'd know that.)"	
Message	Shido	So, what next?	
Message	Maria	"May I... leave it to you? I request a song
that a regular girl would sing."	
Message	Shido	"Um, how about... This new one? Or maybe
a famous pop song."	
Message	Maria	"Would it be okay for you to choose the
specific song?"	
Message	Shido	I see. Then, I'll pick a good one.	
Message	None	"(Not that I'm knowledgeable of what songs
are good. I'll flip through the catalogue.)"	
Choice		Pick a mellow ballad.	
Choice		Pick a cheery pop song.	
Message	Shido	For now, how's this?	
Message	Maria	"Light of the Snow, is it? This title...
I see. A slow tempo ballad, yes?"	
Message	Shido	"Right. It's a slow song, so I thought it might
be easier to sing."	
Message	Maria	"There is no problem. I have heard this song
before.
"	
Message	Maria	But, um, is it a problem for you, Shido?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean? I don't have any problem...	
Message	Maria	"I see. If you have no problem, then neither
do I."	
Message	Shido	"I don't really understand, but if you're ready,
let's play this song. Okay, I'll press it."	
Message	None	"(After I made the selection, the intro began
playing immediately.)"	
Message	Maria	Then Shido, for a brief moment, pardon me.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wha, Maria...?!	
Message	Maria	Could it be that I am too heavy?	
Message	Shido	"No. You're not heavy at all. I'm just surprised.
But, what's wrong, Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"This is a love song, so I thought this to be
appropriate. When couples sing, my records
indicate it is best to sit very close together."	
Message	Shido	"Err. Well, Maria... That's what regular couples
do, and..."	
Message	Maria	Could it be, Shido, that you do not like this?	
Message	Shido	No, I don't mind. I don't mind at all.	
Message	Maria	"I see. How very reassuring. Oh, the song is
about to begin."	
Message	None	"(Was I pushed into this situation? Maria doesn't
seem to be giving much into her singing, but I
can't tell from the side of her face.)"	
Message	Maria	――♪	
Message	Maria	"Um, I am not accustomed to singing, so was
I singing out of key?"	
Message	Shido	No, not at all.	
Message	None	"(Surprisingly, though she's not had much
experience, she sings quite well. Though I
think she could've used more spirit.)"	
Message	None	"(But it wasn't like she was emotionless.
Each word shot through my heart, just from
me sitting next to her.)"	
Message	Maria	Next is your turn, Shido.	
Message	Shido	R-Right!	
Message	Shido	"Whew, it's finally over. It felt both brief
and like an eternity, all at once."	
Message	Maria	"You were quite enthusiastic. You seemed to
sweat a bit. Are you all right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it's nothing! Really!	
Message	Maria	I hope that is the case.	
Message	Shido	"Then, I think a pop song is the best choice.
The words are easy to understand, making
them easy to sing."	
Message	None	"(Looking at the title of the song I chose,
Maria nodded in agreement.)"	
Message	Maria	It is fine. I believe I can sing this song.	
Message	Shido	"Okay. I'll put in a couple similar ones too,
so think of it as practice."	
Message	None	(Then, the intro began to play...)	
Message	Shido	Whew...	
Message	None	"(We sang a few songs, but Maria doesn't
seem satisfied. Her expression hasn't changed
in a while.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria. Are you not having fun?	
Message	Maria	No, that is incorrect. This is very fun.	
Message	Shido	"Is it? You've had this troubled look on your
face for a while now."	
Message	Maria	To be honest, I was deep in thought.	
Message	Shido	"Hm, I figured. If you'd like, we can talk
about it?"	
Message	Maria	"Our conversation would pertain to what I am
thinking... yes?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. We're on a date after all. I want you to
have fun if at all possible, Maria. If something
is bothering you, it'd help if you told me."	
Message	Maria	"...I understand. Shido, would this be called a
date?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? It is a date... I think.	
Message	Maria	"Factually, it is. But to me, it does not quite
feel like a date."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. I don't think you need to worry too much
about that, you know? If you just let loose,
then..."	
Message	Maria	"No. I was wondering if the reason it does
not feel like a date lies with me. I kept on
asking myself... why that might be."	
Message	Shido	But karaoke was fun, wasn't it?	
Message	Maria	Yes. Very much so.	
Message	Shido	"Then focus on that. Instead of worrying about
stuff, it's better to sit back and enjoy the
moment."	
Message	Maria	I see... Okay.	
Message	None	"(It seems like Maria isn't fully convinced.
If it bothers her, I should probably do
something about it.)"	
Message	Shido	We could do something like a couple...	
Message	Maria	Shido, I have a suggestion... Is that all right?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Let's hear it.	
Message	Maria	"What if we held hands while we sing? If we
did that, it could feel more like a date... As if
we were a couple?"	
Message	Shido	Got it. Let's try.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. My records indicate that, when holding
hands while singing, you can pull your
partner's heart closer to you... so they say."	
Message	Shido	"Th-That seems a little specific, but I don't
know if that's true or not..."	
Message	Maria	You do, Shido.	
Message	Shido	...I do? You seem pretty certain, huh?	
Message	Maria	Yes. There should be no mistake.	
Message	Shido	Well, if you insist, Maria... Let's try it.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Let us do so, Shido.	
Message	None	(For now, I requested another song.)	
Message	Shido	Um, so I should hold your hand, right?	
Message	Maria	Er, ah...!	
Message	Shido	Hm, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"I apologize. It was so sudden, I surprised
myself. Um. If the song has begun, I am ready."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. Sorry for touching you so suddenly.	
Message	Maria	No. It is fine.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, there's the title. It's going to connect.
Are you ready?"	
Message	Maria	Yes... Please go ahead.	
Message	None	"(Maria's hand was gentle and soft. It was
also kinda warm. Might be my imagination,
but her face seems more flushed than before.)"	
Message	Maria	Um, Shido... You keep looking at me, why?	
Message	Shido	Ack! S-Sorry!	
Message	None	"(Maria's outfit was pretty, so I couldn't help
from sneaking a peek.)"	
Message	None	"(It's true. I shouldn't be ogling a girl...
Concentrate, concentrate on the song...)"	
Message	Maria	It is over.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, how was it?	
Message	Maria	"Like your warmth has transferred to me, Shido.
I believe this was a couple-like activity."	
Message	Shido	"If you're satisfied, Maria, then I'm glad.
Should we keep going to the next song?"	
Message	Maria	Er, well...	
Message	Shido	"Er, ah. I guess not. Time's almost up, so let's
head home. I'll gather our belongin—"	
Message	Maria	That is no good, either.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Um, Maria?	
Message	None	"(What am I supposed to do in situations
like these? Let go of her hand? Or should
I keep holding onto it?)"	
Message	Maria	Would you... like to go home like this?	
Message	Shido	Like this?	
Message	Maria	"While still holding hands, I mean. Let us
continue our couple-like date until the end."	
Message	Shido	Right... You're right.	
Message	None	"(Maria's smile was sunny, and I answered
hastily, trying to repress how quickly my
heart was beating.)"	
Message	Maria	"Today was enjoyable. Going shopping with the
group, eating sweets, and going to karaoke
with you, Shido..."	
Message	Maria	These are truly memories to cherish.	
Message	Shido	I see. Glad to hear it.	
Message	Maria	"I dearly enjoy spending time with you and
everyone else. I have been tending to this
thought often."	
Message	Shido	I'm happy for you, Maria.	
Message	Maria	You are?	
Message	Shido	"People naturally want to spend time with
others. I think it means you're getting closer
to love, Maria."	
Message	Maria	"I am getting closer to love. Is this because
I have changed?"	
Message	Maria	"You are surely the person who brought\ncolor to my world."	
Message	Shido	Huh, Maria?! That's...	
Message	Maria	"A line from the song we sang. I am beginning
to change now, thanks to you and the others.
I sincerely believe it."	
Message	Shido	Nice. If you think so Maria, then it's true.	
Message	Maria	Yes.
