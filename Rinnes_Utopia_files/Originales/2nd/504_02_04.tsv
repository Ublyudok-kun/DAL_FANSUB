Message	None	(...No one's left here, I think?)	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	None	(All right, then.)	
Message	Shido	Phew. I think I can finally relax here.	
Message	Shido	"Every time I'm in class, for some reason a battle
erupts. It's nice that it's lively and all, but I
want some peace sometimes."	
Message	Shido	Maybe I can nap until the afternoon class.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Shido-san, is that you?	
Message	Shido	Whoa, Kurumi?! You're here...	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. I was here this whole time. Since before you
came up here, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh... Um... what were you doing here all by
yourself..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Nothing. I guess I could say I wanted
to be alone...?"	
Message	Shido	"I see. Sorry for bothering you...
Do you hear a weird sound?"	
Message	Kurumi	Beats me...? Maybe you're imagining things.	
Message	Shido	Huh? You think so?	
Message	Kurumi	"Anyways, Shido-san, did you have something you
wanted to do on the rooftop?"	
Message	Shido	Me? Well I...	
Choice		Wanted to be alone.	
Choice		Wanted to see you Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I too... uh, wanted to be alone a bit,
I guess."	
Message	Kurumi	I see. Then I will give this place to you.	
Message	Shido	What... No, it's fine. You were here first.	
Message	Kurumi	"Don't mind me. It seems like the classroom is
pretty lively, so I'm sure you want some peace
and quiet from time to time."	
Message	Shido	"Y-You understand me? Honestly, I think you're the
first person to understand that."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... It must be tough. Don't mind me. Just
enjoy the fresh air. I have some business to
take care of, so I'll be leaving."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh yeah? Thanks... Sorry about that. I'll take
you up on your offer for today."	
Message	Kurumi	Good day, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"Thanks, Kurumi. It's hard to explain, but it feels
comforting to be with a mature person."	
Message	Kurumi	Don't worry about it.	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Shido	I hear something odd... I wonder what it is.	
Message	Shido	Of course, I've come to see you, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, is that so? I guess you've come to tell some
jokes."	
Message	Shido	D-Does it sound... like I'm kidding?	
Message	Kurumi	Why, yes. I mean, did you know I would be up here?	
Message	Shido	Huh? W-Well...	
Message	Kurumi	"If you've come to see me, then you must know that
I was up here. But that can't be."	
Message	Kurumi	"I didn't tell anyone that I was going to be here.
And I can guarantee that no one followed me on
my way up the stairs."	
Message	Shido	"H-Hm... I guess you're right. I just said it to go
along with the flow."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Shido-san. You still have a long way to
go. I ask you a simple question, and already
you're slipping."	
Message	Shido	You got me there. Sorry.	
Message	Shido	But anyways, why don't we talk while you're here?	
Message	Kurumi	That's kind of you, but I'll refrain.	
Message	Shido	Oh.	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... because if I remained here, I don't think
I could hold it in. I'd want to eat you."	
Message	Shido	Eat me... That wouldn't be good.	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. So with that, I bid you a good day,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Oh hey, Kurumi!	
Message	Shido	"...And she's off. She's always so unfazed by
everything."	
Message	Shido	"But anyways... something sounds weird. I wonder
what it is."	
Message	Shido	"Ah. I'm glad I could spend some time on the
rooftop. I was able to have a relatively
peaceful afternoon."	
Message	None	"(I hope this continues even after I get home...
but I'm sure it won't end up like that.)"	
Message	Shido	"...I'll rest a bit at the park before
heading home."	
Message	Shido	I'm sure I can rest here...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Is that... Kurumi? What is she doing there?	
Message	Kurumi	Awww, kitty. You're so cute.	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh... There, there.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	"Ohhh, what a good widdle kitty you are.
There, there."	
Message	Shido	Um... Kurumi-san?	
Message	Kurumi	*Gasp*!	
Message	Kurumi	Sh-Shido-san...?!	
Message	Shido	...What are you doing?	
Message	Kurumi	I-It's not what it seems...! This is...	
Message	Shido	Huh? That sound... I heard it earlier...	
Message	Shido	Hm...? Huh? Is that a tail?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, you have a tail.	
Message	Kurumi	W-Well, um... it suddenly grew...?	
Message	Shido	"I was wondering what that sound was... It was the
sound of your tail moving."	
Message	Kurumi	"I-It's moving on its own! And besides... ever
since I got a tail, I've been acting weird...
Whenever I see something cute, I can't help it..."	
Message	Shido	So you're reacting to cats...	
Message	Kurumi	Ahhhhhh!	
Message	Kurumi	Hey, don't move around too much.	
Message	Shido	"""Um... you're not the usual Kurumi I know. Normally
you'd be like... ""I'd totally eat a cat,"" or
something similar."""	
Message	Kurumi	"Sh-Shut up! I'm not doing this because I want to.
My body just..."	
Message	Kurumi	Haaaaah!	
Message	Kurumi	Ohhhh, good girl, good girl, good girl...!	
Message	Shido	I wonder why...	
Message	Shido	It's... kind of funny.	
Message	Kurumi	"Sh-Shido-san. C-Can you not watch me so intently?
I... have an image to uphold."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... It's totally different now.	
Message	Kurumi	"I-It's not like that! As I've told you many times,
ever since this tail grew, my body just..."	
Message	Kurumi	Ah! Not again!	
Message	Shido	Hey... did you have that tail this afternoon, too?	
Message	Kurumi	S-Since this morning.	
Message	Shido	"Were you on the rooftop because you didn't want
anyone to see your tail?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Y-Yes... That was the case, but...! I let my
guard down... Seeing you twice today!"	
Message	Kurumi	Ahhhhh.	
Message	Shido	"Hm... It seems like, rather than seeing something
cute, your tail moves every time you're happy."	
Message	Kurumi	I-I'm not happy.	
Message	Kurumi	Haaah!	
Message	Kurumi	This thing is rubbing up against me.	
Message	Shido	"I knew it... Every time you're happy, your tail
moves. It must be expressing your emotions."	
Message	Kurumi	"H-How long do you plan on watching, Shido-san?
P-Please just leave me alone."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? ...But I kind of want to touch and pull on
your tail."	
Message	Kurumi	"N-No, you can't do such a thing! If you do, I
won't forgive you!"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, I thought you'd say no. Oh well... I guess
I'll pretend I didn't see anything, and go
home for the day."	
Message	Kurumi	P-Please do!	
Message	Kurumi	Nyaaaaan.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... It was entertaining to see a side of
Kurumi I've never seen before, but I'm starting
to feel sorry for her."	
Message	Shido	I'll just leave without saying anything...	
Message	Kurumi	Nyaaa-nyaaaa.	
Message	Shido	"Man... I sure saw some odd things today. I wonder
what she's going to do. I wonder if her tail will
stay like that."	
Message	Shido	"If it stays, I bet that tail's going to move
around every time something happens."	
Message	None	"(Oh, but Kurumi is usually such a quiet and cool
girl, so maybe she won't show her emotions in
class, like happiness or anger.)"	
Message	None	(She always seems aloof. Aside from that cat.)	
Message	Shido	Hm? Wait a minute.	
Message	Shido	"When I saw her on the rooftop, I heard sounds.
That means her tail was moving then, right?"	
Message	None	(...So Kurumi was happy back then...?)	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	Shido	I wonder why...?	
Message	Shido	Oh well, I guess I'll go home.
