Message	Shido	"This is all so normal. It's not any different than
ordinary life..."	
Message	Shido	"At the very least, I'm not wondering which gal
game I'm in..."	
Message	Arusu	"The initial setting was arranged to be no
different from your usual everyday routine,
Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	"So this is still like the initial setting of the
game. Why do I have mixed feelings about it?"	
Message	Shido	"Kotori mentioned before that it was originally
similar to my normal life... But that's not even
true."	
Message	Arusu	"The initial setting was a gal game type of world.
If it was no different from your ordinary life,
that means your daily life is like a gal game."	
Message	Shido	You say it so matter-of-factly!	
Message	None	"""(Even hearing Arusu say the words ""gal game"" in
such a serious expression is weird, too.)"""	
Message	Shido	"Well, even yesterday, it wasn't that weird,
was it?"	
Message	Shido	Although the daydream event was unusual...	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. That was truly intriguing. If I want to
discover what love is, I decided that I need to
factor in more of your surroundings."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that?	
Message	Arusu	"I've changed a few settings based on the
information I gathered yesterday. It should be an
environment in which love can more easily grow."	
Message	Shido	I have nothing but bad feelings about this...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I have to go to class. Well... I guess I'll
know after going."	
Message	Shido	Good morning...?!	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-You're late, Shido...san. Please... be sure to
not be late."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino? Uh... What are you doing?	
Message	Tohka	Hey, Shido! Morning! Yoshino is a teacher!	
Message	Shido	T-Teacher...?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes. U-Um... As of today, it seems... that I am
the homeroom teacher... for this class."	
Message	Shido	Whaaaaaat?!	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah. Despite being so little, she's a teacher.
Yoshino is smart. Good job!"	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank... you...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yahoo! A female teacher! The sweet, forbidden\nextra-curricular lessons! How exciting! Isn't\nyour heart pounding just thinking about it?!	
Message	Shido	"No... Honestly, looking at Yoshino... it's hard to
consider her as a teacher."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I knew it... It's weird, isn't it...? But the
school told me... as of today, I'll be a
teacher..."	
Message	Shido	What's... going on...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, it's easy, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...? What are you doing here at school?	
Message	Kurumi	"I am a transfer student. It's not my first time,
so I'm not too surprised."	
Message	Shido	And what's the reasoning behind that?	
Message	Kurumi	"Of course, our roles have changed.
Right, Arusu-san?"	
Message	Arusu	"Yes, exactly. In order to proceed the growth of
love in Shido Itsuka's environment, I changed
the romanceable targets' settings."	
Message	Shido	"Is this what you were talking about earlier? Then,
that means the others—"	
Message	Miku	"I'm here! Darling, we'll always be able to be
together!"	
Message	Shido	M-Miku...? You're a transfer student, too?	
Message	Miku	"Rather than a transfer student, I'm more like an
exchange student, no...?"	
Message	Shido	Exchange student... as in international?	
Message	Miku	"No～! I mean that Rindouji All-Girls School and
Raizen High School exchanges students～ But I'm
in a separate classroom from you. So bummed!"	
Message	Shido	Uh, Miku... you're a year older than me anyways...	
Message	Miku	Who cares about the small details, gosh!	
Message	Tonomachi	M-Miku-tan...? What is... going on, Itsuka...?!	
Message	Shido	"Uh... I guess she's not transferring, but
something similar to it?"	
Message	Ai	"Did you hear the missus? She called him ""darling""..."	
Message	Mai	"""Yes, ma'am, I did. Who says ""darling"" these days?
So lame. I guess that's Itsuka-san's new woman."""	
Message	Mii	That's so lame.	
Message	Shido	"Could you guys shut up?! Argh... Well... good
thing she's in a different class..."	
Message	Miku	"Awww. I wanted to be in your class, darling! I'm
in the same class as Kaguya-san and Yuzuru-san."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, is that so... At least you know someone...
Wait, so they're your classmates?"	
Message	Miku	Seems like it～ I'm looking forward to it!	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	"So, I guess I skipped grades and I am now in high
school, Onii-chan!"	
Message	Shido	Kotori... Not you, too.	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. When I went to school, they told me I'd be
skipping and shipping off!"	
Message	Shido	You don't seem to be bothered by it too much.	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah, I mean, if you're going to get a heroine
that's younger, forcing them into the same school
is pretty common in a gal game."	
Message	Shido	That may be true, but...	
Message	Kotori	"But it was pretty annoying that I went all the way
to school before knowing. Arusu, why didn’t you
tell me? I would've gone with you guys earlier..."	
Message	Arusu	I wasn't aware of the specific setting changes.	
Message	Arusu	"I'm sorry for putting you through
the extra trouble."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, it's not a big deal. So you're trying to
gather all of Shido's targets, but you don't
seem to know the specifics, huh..."	
Message	Arusu	Yes, exactly.	
Message	Kotori	"Then that means the in-game system is kind of
autonomous and moving on its own. All right,
that's pretty good information to have."	
Message	Yoshino	"E-Everyone! Class is about to s-start! Miku-san,
Kotori-san, please return to your classrooms～"	
Message	Kotori	"Awww, I wanted to be in the same class as
Onii-chan! Onii-chan, live strong!"	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Kotori	All right, Onii-chan, later!	
Message	Yoshino	I-I will now be... taking roll call!	
Message	Shido	...Yoshino seems to be pumped.	
Message	None	"(Maybe she's happy playing the teacher role. She's
working so hard. It's kinda adorable.)"	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, morning, Origami. It's been such a commotion
this morning."	
Message	Origami	"The class environment has changed drastically.
It's a possibility that some dangers may arise, so
Shido, you should stay by my side more than usual."	
Message	Shido	"Hm? I mean, you've always been sitting next to me,
so we're pretty close as it is."	
Message	Origami	"You should be even closer. To be specific, we
should be close to the point where our shoulders
touch. Or rather, you should sit on my lap."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no! Especially that last part!
It's so weird!"	
Message	Origami	"Then I can shift my plans slightly to sit on your
lap instead. That's not so bad."	
Message	Shido	"Wait a minute! Why are you putting your hands up
your skirt?! What are you trying to take off?!"	
Message	Origami	"I mean, there could be an accident... So I was
going to prepare for that. It's no problem."	
Message	Shido	"There is a big problem with that! Okay... I'll put
my desk a little closer, so please just accept
that..."	
Message	Origami	"Understood. But I will let them know that I was
forced into a significant compromise."	
Message	Shido	You're way too intense...	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Hey, Shido! Why are you so close to Origami
Tobiichi? That's not fair, Origami Tobiichi!
I want to be close to him, too!"	
Message	Origami	"That is not possible. If both of Shido's sides are
taken, there will be no escape route for him
should danger arise."	
Message	Tohka	"What... Then you should stay away from
him as well!"	
Message	Yoshino	H-Hey... I'm going to take roll call...!	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino, hang in there! Be a teacher and don't be\nafraid to come down hard on them!	
Message	Yoshino	"O-Okay!
"	
Message	Yoshino	"E-Everyone, please sit down and
listen to your teacher!"	
Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... I feel like today is going to be even
more tiring than yesterday..."	
Message	None	(We're in class right now, but...)	
Message	Tohka	...Grr.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(In the end, both Origami and Tohka were
instructed to not be near me.)"	
Message	None	"(However, they're glaring at each other from
opposite sides of me. It's really unnerving...)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Heh.	
Message	Shido	Whoa, what the—?! I felt a chill go down my back.	
Message	Kurumi	"So not only those two, but you won't even be with
me?"	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi, not you too... Cut it out, we're in class.
And besides, what are you going to do if they
cause a commotion again?"	
Message	Kurumi	"It'll be fine. It appears that both Tohka-san and
Origami-san are busy glaring at one another...
"	
Message	Kurumi	So you can give me some attention.	
Message	Shido	Who's the one that sat Kurumi behind me...	
Message	None	"(She's reaching over to me, and I can feel her
breath on my skin. She smells good too, so it's
distracting...)"	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Kurumi	"I don't know about that, but... I know I love my
seat, I get to see you and do things like this—"	
Message	Shido	"Ahh?! H-Hey, stop running your finger down my
spine!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... It seems this is the perfect spot for me
to tease you. But Shido-san, I didn't know you
were weak against these things. I feel tempted..."	
Message	None	"(Ahh! Kurumi's moving her fingers from my spine to
under my arms... It tickles... This isn't good.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"You seem to have muscles, too. I'm not used to
touching a man, so it's extremely intriguing."	
Message	Shido	"You sure seem to be used to it! Hey... Where are
you touching...?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Shh... if you make a fuss, people around you are
going to notice."	
Message	Kurumi	"Be quiet... And let me make this fun for you.
So... do you like this...?"	
Message	Shido	O-Ohhh...	
Message	Origami	Kurumi Tokisaki. What are you doing?	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm having some fun with Shido-san. Shido-san's
body is surprisingly nice."	
Message	Origami	"Shido's body fat is normally 7%, but this week he
has been eating more, so touching him under these
conditions has been more comforting lately."	
Message	Shido	Why do you know such things?	
Message	Origami	Kurumi Tokisaki. Put that finger away.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, you sure look intimidating. But I refuse.
See, look... I can even touch places like here."	
Message	Shido	Agh?!	
Message	Origami	I take your actions as a declaration of battle.	
Message	Shido	That is definitely the wrong conclusion!	
Message	Tohka	"What are you doing?! I have been trying my hardest
to refrain from such things!"	
Message	Shido	"Well, what are you raising your voice during class
for?!"	
Message	Ai	"S-Skinship with a few people during c-class... You
seriously are an embarrassment, Itsuka-kun."	
Message	Mai	"Just because we're in English class doesn't give
you an excuse to go from A to B all the way down
the alphabet! Gosh, I can see right through you."	
Message	Mii	That's so lame.	
Message	Shido	"That's not something I'd ever think, much less
say! God, help me!"	
Message	None	"(In the end, I was the one making the most noise
and was the only one who got in trouble.)"	
Message	None	(Not fair...!)	
Message	Shido	F-Finally, it's lunch time... I-I'm tired.	
Message	None	"(I finally get to take a break...
Of course not...)"	
Message	Miku	Darling! Your beloved Miku has come to visit you!	
Message	Tonomachi	"I hope Itsuka stubs his toe on a drawer edge.
I hope Itsuka stubs his toe on a drawer edge.
I hope Itsuka stubs his toe on a drawer edge!"	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi, you're scaring me!	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san? You sure seem tired. If you'd like, I
can give you a massage... I promise to show you an
even better time than earlier."	
Message	Shido	If you do any more, it's not going to end well!	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um, Shido-san... I don't know anyone in the
teacher's lounge... May I... sit with... you...?"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino... That's true, I don't blame you. Sure,
you can sit with me."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my, Shido-san... You sure seem to be easy on
Yoshino-san. I've asked around, but... do you
swing that way?"	
Message	Shido	"No. Absolutely not! Yoshino, unlike you guys, is a
good girl! She doesn't cause me any trouble, she's
like an oasis for me!"	
Message	Yoshino	H-He called me good girl. Hehe...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino～ What happened to your mature girl\ncharms?	
Message	Yoshino	O-Oh... but...	
Message	Miku	"Heh. Darling is only nice to children, right? I
mean you did say you like ""big"" ones..."	
Message	Shido	No, no, no! I never said such a thing!	
Message	Miku	"Whaaat? But you're always looking at this area
with those lustful eyes, aren't you? Darling...
you don't have to hide it!"	
Message	Shido	You've got the wrong idea!	
Message	Yoshino	...Hehe.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, nothing... I just thought... this is what your
everyday at school must be like..."	
Message	Yoshino	"For me... Um... Unlike Tohka-san, Kaguya-san, and
Yuzuru-san, I don't get to see this side of you
all the time..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you're right... Well, it's not always
this rowdy."	
Message	Miku	"I want to see your school life more, too. Are you
sure you don't want to transfer to my school,
darling?"	
Message	Shido	It's an all-girls school!	
Message	Miku	"You can be Shiori-san, no problem. Shiori-san will
still be my darling."	
Message	Kurumi	"Come to think of it, I've never played with
Shiori-san before. I'd love to meet her, too..."	
Message	Yoshinon	Oh, nooo! Yoshino, there are two fan-service\nroles at play here! You have no choice but\nto counter from a teacher's standpoint!	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What's that...?	
Message	Shido	"Ugh... The more the merrier, I guess... More like
pure chaos."	
Message	Shido	And it's only three of them right—	
Message	Tohka	Shido! It's lunch time! Let's eat!	
Message	Origami	"Shido, I do not recommend that you eat with Tohka
Yatogami."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph. Origami Tobiichi, you... You're in my way
yet again...!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... You seem to be livelier than usual.
However, Shido Itsuka belongs to me. I—"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. Miku and Yoshino, you are new to this
school, so why don't you take a tour? Meanwhile,
Yuzuru and Kaguya will take care of Shido."	
Message	Shido	"They're all coming! I can't even get a break
during my break!"	
Message	Kotori	Shido! Where's my lunch?	
Message	Shido	"It's in my bag! Sorry, I... uh... need to use the
bathroom!"	
Message	Shido	"I-I really can't get away if they're all at school
like this... I never thought it'd be this crazy..."	
Message	Shido	"Maybe I can go to a farther bathroom. I need
as much time alone as I can..."	
Message	Arusu	Shido Itsuka, you don't like this situation?	
Message	Shido	"Whoa, Arusu! No, well... it's different than what
I'm used to. I wish it'd be more peaceful..."	
Message	Arusu	"I thought this would make it easier to observe
love, but does this mean... Shido Itsuka doesn't
appreciate this moment?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... well, it's not that exactly, but... I can't
lie. It's all chaos, just one thing after the
other. I'm getting really tired..."	
Message	Arusu	"So everyone should... get along? Would it be
better if everyone were friends?"	
Message	Shido	Well... I guess you could say that.	
Message	Arusu	Understood. I will search for such situations.	
Message	Kotori	"Onii-chan, you're late! Everyone's moved on and
they're waiting for you!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Moved on?	
Message	Kotori	Don't worry about it. Come this way!	
Message	Shido	...The cafeteria?	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. We all decided to eat lunch with you!	
Message	Shido	"You all... All of you guys are there...? Hmm...
that seems like it would be pretty chaotic."	
Message	None	"(Is this because Arusu and I talked about them
getting along?)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! This way, sit next to me! Let's enjoy our
lunch together."	
Message	Origami	"I need to check whether there's poison in your
food. I will taste-test all of it. That would be
best to ensure your safety."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... Just as I thought, nothing's changed...	
Message	Yoshinon	Come on, Yoshino! Let's set that plan we thought\nof earlier into motion! When are you doing it?\nNow, right?!	
Message	Yoshino	B-But, I'm embarrassed...	
Message	Yoshinon	Gosh! You're a teacher today, so you need to feed\nhim with an 'Ahh' like the good adult you are!	
Message	Yoshino	*Whimper*... I'm so embarrassed.	
Message	Tohka	"OHH! I want to try that too, Shido!
Come, try this."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, what a great idea. But it may not be enough
stimulation for Shido-san. Why don't I feed you
with my mouth?"	
Message	Origami	"I should be the one to do so. Then I can taste
test at the same time. Passing something from my
mouth to his will be good for digestion as well."	
Message	Shido	"What am I, a baby? Jeez, everyone, can't we eat in
peace? In peace, and as friends!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Shido needs a guard, doesn't he? Us Yamai
sisters would be perfect for the role. We'll be
his vigilant wings and protect him from danger."	
Message	Shido	This isn't about bodyguarding. This is lunch!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Attention. I am unsatisfied with how far I am from
Shido. Tohka and Master Origami are always with
him, so it is fair that they move away from him."	
Message	Tohka	"N-No way! Food tastes so much better when I eat
near Shido!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Accusation. So are you suggesting that it's okay
if no one else is able to enjoy their meal?"	
Message	Tohka	Well... that's not true, but...	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... If we are the ones to carry the offering
to his mouth, then I'm sure it will be heavenly..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"I concur. I obtained this after an intense battle
at the snack stand. Both Yuzuru and Kaguya will
feed this to you, Shido. Now, Shido—"	
Message	Miku	Hi, darling! Open wiiiiiide.	
Message	Shido	*Nom*... Miku?!	
Message	Miku	"Perfect! See, this is our first step as loving
newlyweds."	
Message	Kaguya	"*Grunt* How dare you cut in line ahead of us...!
I can pay you back for the Tenou Festival now...!"	
Message	Miku	Ahhhh! Darling. Kaguya-san is sooo scary!	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe. Are you scared? Save your fear for the
power of the Yamai Sisters...!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"""Disagree. She's pressing her ""goods"" against
Shido, appealing to the male psyche. Kaguya,
you cannot compete with that trick."""	
Message	Kaguya	"Wh-What, that's totally not fair! You don't have
to say that, Yuzuru!"	
Message	Miku	"Everyone, stop arguing! Hehe, one of you guys can
get on my lap, too. How about you, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino is an adult today! So she won't be doing\nsuch a childish thing! Right, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yes... I-I'm a teacher... So I'm going to feed
Shido-san."	
Message	Miku	Aww, how unfortunate. How about you, Kotori-chan?	
Message	Kotori	"It does seem to be a full house, so maybe I'll sit
on my brother's lap. Don't you want your beloved
sister to feed you, dear Onii-chan?"	
Message	Tohka	"Th-That's not fair, Kotori! I want to do that,
too!"	
Message	Shido	You guys, cut it out!	
Message	Shido	"It's nice to have a meal with everyone... But it
has to actually be fun!"	
Message	Arusu	"...I tried to gather everyone in a friendly
setting. Was that not good enough? Dining
together should be a friendly interaction."	
Message	Shido	"I knew it... It's supposed to be friendly, but at
this rate, the location just changed and
nothing's improved."	
Message	Shido	"I can't even eat my own food in peace, much less a
bite from everyone else's."	
Message	Arusu	"...I see. There is an upper limit of food you can
physically consume."	
Message	Arusu	"Then... During dinner, everyone can prepare one
dish, and Shido can choose what to eat...
That way, the situation can be settled, correct?"	
Message	Tohka	If we do that, will I be able to feed Shido?	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. The dish that Shido Itsuka chooses can be fed
to him by the winner."	
Message	Tohka	"I see! Then leave it to me. I'm going to make
something delicious and feed Shido!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Foolish. The Yamai Sisters have survived
many battles, among them cooking, of course."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. And this time we will be cooperating
with each other. I can say that victory is ours."	
Message	Yoshino	Aww... A battle... I can't cook at all...	
Message	Yoshinon	It's totally fine, you can do it! I mean, clearly\neveryone here will be garbage! Yoshino, you can\nwin it! I believe in you!	
Message	Kurumi	"Cooking can change in various ways depending on
how much time you spend on the ingredients. So it
makes sense that I would win."	
Message	Miku	I will do anything for you, darling!	
Message	Shido	"I see... Then why don't we eat in peace now and do
this battle thing at night?"	
Message	Shido	"Phew... it seems like I can finally eat. Thank
you, Arusu."	
Message	Arusu	"You seemed to be troubled, Shido Itsuka. My data
shows that making choices is important to growing
love."	
Message	Shido	"Or what Kotori would say is typical of gal games,
huh..."	
Message	Shido	"The fact that this is being called a battle
worries me... I'm hoping it won't end badly."	
Message	Shido	All right, it's time to eat! I'm digging in!	
Message	Shido	Phew. Class is finally over.	
Message	None	(I need to go shopping for the food battle.)	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Arusu. You're going with us to the market,
right?"	
Message	Arusu	"...School is now over. Again... show me your
selection. The potential to which it may lead..."	
Message	Shido	"Arusu...? Don't tell me something like yesterday
is about to happen—"
