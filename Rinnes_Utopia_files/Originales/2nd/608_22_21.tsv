Message	None	"(Morning bustle aside, class proceeded without
much of a problem. Before I knew it, it was time
for lunch.)"	
Message	Tohka	Here, Shido! It is time for luncheon!	
Message	Origami	"Shido, unfortunately I have dropped my
chopsticks. The only recourse is for you to
feed me with your chopsticks."	
Message	Yoshino	"S-Shido-san. I... also made side dishes.
If you'd like, please... eat them."	
Message	None	"(In the end, we all ate together. Not that it's
particularly a problem...)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, I feel a bit unwell today. Would
you kindly pat me on the head?"	
Message	Kotori	Shido, take a hand towel.	
Message	None	(Well, it always ends up like this...)	
Message	Kaguya	"Don't be afraid of Yamai cooking, Shido. We
shall share our ultimate dish with you."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Comment. I prepared the most of it. In the
end, Kaguya really only packed it."	
Message	Kaguya	"I-I worked too, y'know. I-I pulled apart the
lettuce, and I warmed up the side dishes with
the microwave!"	
Message	None	(It's noisy... Really noisy.)	
Message	Miku	Here, darling. Open up and say, "Aaah～."	
Message	Shido	Aaaah... *munch, munch*.	
Message	None	"(I'll try my best to keep quiet and do as I'm
told, in order to overcome this situation.)"	
Message	Maria	......	
Message	Yuzuru	"Petition. Shido, please sample what Kaguya and
I have prepared for you as well."	
Message	Shido	Sure... *munch, munch*.	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san. Please, eat mine too...	
Message	Yoshinon	"All right, Shido-kun! Open wide and take a\nbig bite!"	
Message	Shido	Mmm... *munch, munch*.	
Message	Tohka	Okay, next is my turn!	
Message	Origami	"Shido, you needn't force yourself to eat their
food. I will spoon-feed you the proper amount,
while also thinking of nutritional value."	
Message	Shido	Mrph... Urfff.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, since I have the opportunity, would you
like to try my lunch as well?"	
Message	Shido	Urf... *murble, murble*!	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant*... *cough*.	
Message	Miku	Hmmm? Darling, are you done already?	
Message	Shido	"How much food are you guys trying to feed
me?! That's enough. I'm full! I'll stop here!"	
Message	Origami	"Then Shido, light exercise is necessary after a
meal. Here, come with me over here."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun! Don't you want to have a chat with\nYoshino-sensei in the guidance counselor's\noffice? It'll be just the two of you, get it?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon! You can't say that...	
Message	Shido	No. I appreciate it, but I just need some rest.	
Message	Maria	Shido, please have some tea.	
Message	Shido	"*gulp, gulp*... Whew. That calmed me down
a bit. Thanks, Maria."	
Message	Maria	You are welcome.	
Message	Tohka	Hrm?!	
Message	Origami	...?!	
Message	Yoshino	Ah...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Identification. I do not understand. Arusu is
acting like his wife."	
Message	Kaguya	"First of all Arusu, you've been sneakily
occupying Shido's side for a while now.
It's not fair!"	
Message	Maria	I am merely acting in Shido's best interests.	
Message	Kurumi	I see. Your timing just now was convenient.	
Message	Maria	"It was quite obvious this would happen when
everyone met together. Shido is incapable of
favoring any of you, after all."	
Message	Kaguya	Rgh. Where'd this... confidence come from?	
Message	Yuzuru	Shock. She knows well how to curry favor.	
Message	Miku	You two seem veeeeeery close.	
Message	Maria	"Yes, you are not mistaken. Not only had we
walked together to school, but we also woke
up together as well."	
Message	Shido	"Pffffffff!!
"	
Message	Shido	*cough*...	
Message	Shido	 *cough*!	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, sure you could say that, but it was
nothing serious..."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, what does she mean...?	
Message	Shido	It's not true, Yoshino. Don't worry...	
Message	Origami	"Shido. I have no intention of condemning you.
However, for the sake of equality, you should
also have a morning liaison with me."	
Message	Shido	"I didn't! It's not anything like that.
Nothing happened."	
Message	Maria	"Firstly, everyone has been prioritizing their
own desires, instead of thinking of Shido.
I believe you should be more aware of this."	
Message	Kurumi	Hmmhmhm. That is in fact true.	
Message	Miku	"But that doesn't have anything to do with
the fact that you slept with darling, does it～?"	
Message	None	"(Maria, all of this because you had to say
something unnecessary...)"	
Message	Tohka	"From what was just said, did I hear Arusu slept
together with Shido?! Arusu, weren't you
forbidden from doing that?! Kotori made it clear."	
Message	Maria	I was not told such a thing.	
Message	Tohka	Grrr...	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori, help me...!	
Message	Kotori	I'm all done eating.	
Message	Kotori	"Alright then, Onii-chan.
If you take too long, you'll be late, you know?
I'll be returning to the classroom first."	
Message	Shido	What, Kotori?! D-Damn it, if it's come to this...	
Message	None	"(I'll run away too! Aaah, geez. It's been
nothing but trouble lately!)"	
Message	Tohka	Ahh! Wait right there, Shido!	
Message	Origami	"Wait, Shido. Also, be sure to leave your pillow
vertical to alert me when it's all right to crawl
into your futon."	
Message	Kaguya	"We shall not let you escape. Ownership of Shido
belongs to the Yamai Sisters!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Pursuit. We will follow you everywhere, Shido.	
Message	Yoshino	S-Shido-san, please wait...!	
Message	Miku	Aaah, darling～. It's no use running away!	
Message	Kurumi	Goodness, how very noisy...
