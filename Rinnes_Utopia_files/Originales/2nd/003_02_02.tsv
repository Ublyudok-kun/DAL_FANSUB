Message	Shido	"I-If I have to choose one person... I guess it'd
be Origami."	
Message	Origami	I had faith that you'd say that, Shido.	
Message	Kaguya	"What?! Are you insane, Shido? Why won't you
say you'll go with me?!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Jealousy. Although Master Origami is indeed a
wonderful woman, why wouldn't you choose
Kaguya or Yuzuru?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, hold on. It's not like that. Well, you
see... Uh, right. I wanted to talk to Origami
about something..."	
Message	Miku	"What, no fairrrrr... If you want to talk, just
get it over with and go on a date with me,
darling!"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! Of all people, Origami Tobiichi?! You'd
have so much more fun going on a date with me!"	
Message	Shido	Ngh... It's no use. This is getting out of hand.	
Message	None	"(I know! At a time like this... I'm going to have
to call the Fraxinus for help...)"	
Message	None	"(Whenever I run into issues, they always give me
some pointers or instructions. They should be
able to save me from this situation...!)"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you seem to be in trouble, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Perfect timing, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(My little sister Kotori is the Commander of the
Fraxinus. She should be a dependable advisor at
a time like this... I think.)"	
Message	Shido	Can you solve this problem for me?	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm. The girls in front of you, aside from\nOrigami, may possibly go berserk if you\nhurt them carelessly. You know that, right?"	
Message	Shido	I know that. That's why I'm struggling.	
Message	Kotori	"And you're going to choose Origami, knowing\nthat?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Of all the girls here, Origami is the only
one who's not a Spirit. I feel like if I choose
her, it'll be the most fair..."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Well, surprisingly, it looks like you've\nthought it through for once. Then you do that.\nI'll handle the others."	
Message	Shido	Got it, thanks.	
Message	Shido	All right, Origami...	
Message	Origami	Roger.	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Origami	Let's go now... Come, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Where did you get that?!	
Message	Origami	Come.	
Message	Shido	Ahhh... Hey...?!	
Message	None	(Origami pulled my hand and led me to...)	
Message	Shido	Our classroom...	
Message	Origami	I don't think anyone will find us here.	
Message	Shido	"Th-That's true. I guess no one would think we'd
come back to our starting point..."	
Message	Origami	"And if were to do something naughty, no one
would catch us here."	
Message	Shido	W-We won't be... doing anything like that.	
Message	Origami	Then, something dirty...	
Message	Shido	That means the same thing!	
Message	Origami	Something indecent...	
Message	Shido	This is a school! It's not that kind of place!	
Message	Origami	"So, it's something we can do if we change
locations?"	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not what I meant, either!	
Message	Origami	That's unfortunate...	
Message	Shido	"I see... So, now that we're back here, what
should we do?"	
Message	Origami	Homework. We might as well finish.	
Message	Shido	"Like I said, I won't—
Wait, what? Homework?"	
Message	Origami	Exactly. It's just as you said.	
Message	Shido	"Sure, but... Well, I guess I have you here, so
I'll do it. Can I ask you questions?"	
Message	Origami	Leave it to me. I'll teach you anything.	
Message	Shido	W-Well... I meant studying, okay?	
Message	Shido	Hey... Wait, Origami.	
Message	Origami	What is it?	
Message	Shido	That's my desk. And all my books are in there...	
Message	Origami	"It's fine. Shido, you can use my desk and my
books."	
Message	Shido	Why...?	
Message	Origami	We'll make faster progress in various ways.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Whoa... She's already started concentrating...
So this is how an elite focuses..."	
Message	Origami	...*Pant, pant*. Shido's... chair... desk...	
Message	Shido	HEY!	
Message	Origami	"No problem. We're dating, Shido. So I can sit on
the chair where you'd normally sit, and imagine
things. It's natural."	
Message	Shido	Ngh... Well...	
Message	None	"(There was a time I did kind of confess my love
for Origami. It was kind of training to be with
a Spirit...)"	
Message	None	"(But Origami had no idea about the training,
and accepted my confession... And for some
reason she agreed to it...)"	
Message	None	(I guess we're currently a couple.)	
Message	None	"(I wanted to clear up this mistake somehow,
but...)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami? You know... About us dating...	
Message	Origami	"Shido, you've seen my underwear, sniffed my
gym clothes, and even had me stand in front
of everyone in a swimsuit and dog leash..."	
Message	Origami	"But don't worry. I'm taking all of that
inappropriate behavior as your way of
expressing your love for us as a couple."	
Message	Shido	"Agh... Those were all accidents or
misunderstandings...! But I guess I can't
deny that they happened..."	
Message	Origami	"So Shido, don't hold back. You can bury your
face into my chair and breathe it in. In fact, I
would love if you did that."	
Message	Shido	I would never!	
Message	Origami	You won't?	
Message	Shido	I won't... All right, let's do homework.	
Message	Origami	Okay.	
Message	None	"(We continued to talk together at school until
we finished our homework.)"
