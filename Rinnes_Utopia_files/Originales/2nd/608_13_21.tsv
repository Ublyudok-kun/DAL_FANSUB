Message	Yoshino	"E-Everyone, please! Be quiet.
Presenting... a new transfer student!"	
Message	Maria	I am Maria Arusu. A pleasure to meet everyone.	
Message	None	"(As homeroom kicked off, Maria was welcomed
into our class, introduced as a transfer student.
The class murmured amongst themselves.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"I have a question! Where'd you come from,
Arusu-san?"	
Message	Maria	"Where did I come from? I walked here
from Shido's house."	
Message	None	(Oh, shoot.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"Wh-What does she mean, Shido?!
"	
Message	Tonomachi	Again...? Have you done it again?!	
Message	Maria	"I know not what you are asking, but my
words were clear. I ate breakfast at Shido's
house, then walked with him to school."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Wh-Wh-Wh-What does that mean, Shido?!
"	
Message	Tonomachi	Explain... Explain yourself!!	
Message	Shido	"No need to repeat yourself! Um, firstly, Maria.
I think that he was trying to ask about where
you lived before you transferred here."	
Message	Maria	"Understood. It was a case of answering the
question literally. However, it seems I was
successful in making an impression."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Ai	"From Itsuka-kun's house... What does that mean?
They even ate breakfast together..."	
Message	Mai	"They're already speaking like they're close.
That's suspicious. Could she be another rival
to Tohka?"	
Message	Mii	"Laying hands on a transfer student on their
first day... is definitely NOT cool."	
Message	Shido	Ugh. I-It's not what you think. This is, um...	
Message	Shido	"Maria's from another country. She moved to Japan
for her parents' work, but they couldn't move
with her, so she's staying at my place for now..."	
Message	None	(Gah. Everyone's clearly suspicious...)	
Message	Shido	R-Right, Maria?!	
Message	Maria	Hm...	
Message	None	(Please, nod in agreement to my story.)	
Message	Maria	"It's as Shido says. Until my parents settle into
their new housing, I must reside with Shido.
Our parents are acquaintances."	
Message	None	(...Whew.)	
Message	Tohka	Really?! Is that so?!	
Message	Shido	"Er, you've heard about the situation before,
so you don't have to act so surprised."	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... Then, Arusu-san, you can take a seat
in the back... Oh."	
Message	None	"(Without waiting for Yoshino's instructions,
Maria started approaching me.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, was my answer adequate?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you saved me. I almost had a heart
attack."	
Message	Maria	"I was hesitant to make a false statement,
but it was for your sake, Shido."	
Message	Shido	For my sake?	
Message	Maria	"If someone is in trouble, you help them.
Does this conflict with your principles,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	No, it doesn't. Thanks, Maria.	
Message	Maria	That is one favor owed.	
Message	Shido	A favor, really...?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... Your seats, please!	
Message	Shido	R-Right. Sorry...	
Message	Maria	"Is it not advised to use honorifics when
addressing a teacher?"	
Message	Shido	"Er, it is, but I messed up. You should take a
seat too."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. There is a limit to how often I can speak
like this."	
Message	Shido	So you knew... Anyway, take a seat.	
Message	Maria	Yes.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, Arusu-san. You said you're staying at
Itsuka's house, but are you okay? He hasn't
been weird, has he? He's a real Lothario."	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi, stop bad-mouthing me behind my―	
Message	Maria	"I am fine, Hiroto Tonomachi. If you are worried
for my sake, then please tell me more about this
school."	
Message	Tonomachi	Er? Huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	 Me?	
Message	Tonomachi	 Do you mean me?	
Message	Maria	Yes.	
Message	Tonomachi	"I-I-I would love to! I, Hiroto Tonomachi,
will do anything for you, Arusu-san!"	
Message	Maria	I see. Thank you very much.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Whoohoooo, finally, spring has come for me!
Heh heh, heh heh heh heh..."	
Message	None	"(Tonomachi, even in this world, you're so
pathetic...)"	
Message	None	"(But still, Maria is actually trying to
 interact with everyone.)"	
Message	None	"(There's something different about her than
when we first met. I thought she was stoic, but
she's actually cute. Kinda mysterious, too.)"	
Message	Shido	My memories are a little fuzzy for some reason.	
Message	None	"(I wonder why that is. Something doesn't add up.
I'm missing something... I think.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, it's probably my imagination.
