Message	Shido	Man, today was something...	
Message	Shido	"My whole afternoon's gone because of that weird
phenomenon... I was planning on going shopping,
but now it's dark out."	
Message	None	"(I had Arusu go straight home. It seems like it's
fine that she's not with me 24/7.)"	
Message	Shido	"I need to hurry home, or Tohka will be hungry.
That won't end well."	
Message	None	"(Normally Tohka and the girls live next to me, but
today we're going to have dinner together.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well... our situation is so confusing. We should
stick together as much as possible."	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? That's... Arusu, right?
She should be home..."	
Message	Shido	Hey Arusu—	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	Huh... Where did she go? What's going on...?	
Message	Shido	That was... Arusu, right? I could be wrong.	
Message	Shido	...I'm curious. I'm going to run after her.	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant*... *pant*...	
Message	Shido	Damn it. I should have left my groceries behind.	
Message	Shido	But... This is Takadai Park.	
Message	Arusu	"Hehe... Just as I thought. You ran after me, Shido
Itsuka."	
Message	None	(Huh? It's Arusu, right? She seems different...)	
Message	Arusu	"You could have left that bag behind, you know?
No one in this world would steal it."	
Message	Arusu	"But... I guess that's what makes you a good guy.
Why did you run after me? Are you interested in
me?"	
Message	Shido	"Are you... Arusu? The way you speak is like a
completely different person."	
Message	Arusu	"Haha, a completely different person, huh?
Surprised? Which one do you like more?"	
Message	Shido	Are you really Arusu?	
Message	Arusu	Hehe... That's right.	
Message	Shido	"It's true... your face and voice are the same,
but..."	
Message	Arusu	"I am Arusu. There is no doubt about it...
I am Arusu."	
Message	Shido	I see... I suppose so.	
Message	Arusu	"Hm... Let's see. I am Arusu. But I guess I could
also say that I'm not Arusu."	
Message	Shido	"You are her, but you're not? So... you have
a split personality?"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if it's like Yoshino and Yoshinon...
If that's the case, it kind of makes sense.)"	
Message	Arusu	Beats me! Hehe...	
Message	Arusu	"Shido Itsuka. Here, in this world, what are you
going to do...? How will things unfold?"	
Message	Arusu	"I am looking forward to that. So I want you to do
more, and make your choice."	
Message	Arusu	"And show me. I want to see what love means to all
of you."	
Message	Shido	So you are the same. You and the Arusu I know.	
Message	Arusu	"Then, let's end it here for now...
See you, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Whoa, it's bright...!	
Message	Shido	What was that light? Hey, Arusu?	
Message	Shido	She's gone... What was that?	
Message	Shido	That was Arusu, right? I'm sure of it...	
Message	Shido	Oh, well... I guess I can go home.	
Message	Shido	"So many things happened that didn't make any
sense. I'm so tired..."	
Message	Shido	I'm home.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Arusu? You're here.	
Message	Arusu	Yes. Did you have business with me?	
Message	Shido	Uh... Weren't you just at Takadai Park?	
Message	Arusu	"No. I came straight back to the Itsuka residence
after school."	
Message	Shido	And you didn't go anywhere afterwards?	
Message	Arusu	"Correct. I do not understand the intent behind
your question, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Well... Uh...	
Message	None	"(The girl I spoke to earlier was Arusu, or so I
thought. Whether she doesn't remember or she's
lying, I doubt I can get any more information...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! You're late. Where did you go?
I'm starving!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry about that. I'll prepare dinner now, so
hold on."	
Message	Tohka	Okay! 	
Message	Arusu	Shido Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	"...No, what I saw earlier was nothing. I think I
misunderstood, so don't worry."	
Message	Arusu	Okay.	
Message	Shido	"It could be one of those walkthrough hints... And
it could be a navigation NPC..."	
Message	None	"(The usual light Arusu and the dark Arusu I
encountered earlier seem to have different
personalities depending on their role.)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	None	"(No matter how much I think about it, there are
too many unknown factors.)"	
Message	Shido	Well... I guess I'll save that for later.
