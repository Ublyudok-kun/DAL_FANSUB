Message	Shido	...Huh? Where am I...?	
Message	Shido	School...? When did I get to school?	
Message	Shido	...Uh.	
Message	None	"(That's right. I think... I finished class, and...
uhh, it's... that's right. Lunch time.)"	
Message	None	"(I left home as usual and I should have... come to
school alone...)"	
Message	Shido	"That's right. Nothing's... out of the ordinary,
right?"	
Message	None	"(Something feels really off. My head feels
hazy...)"	
Message	Shido	...Something feels weird.	
Message	Tonomachi	What's the matter, Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	Oh... Tonomachi...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey... You don't look too good, man.
What's going on?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... I just feel... weird. Like... my head feels
like... I'm in a daze..."	
Message	Tonomachi	You up late last night or something?	
Message	Shido	"I slept really well, so I don't think that's it.
I just felt dizzy when I was walking just now."	
Message	Tonomachi	Hmm... I see.	
Message	Shido	"Oh... And I feel chills, and I have a runny nose,
and my head's aching."	
Message	Tonomachi	Wait, Itsuka... Those symptoms sound familiar.	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What could it be...	
Message	Tonomachi	It's definitely... a cold.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... You might be right.	
Message	None	(...Come to think of it, it is a cold.)	
Message	None	"(But I don't remember being like this earlier in
the morning. Maybe I can't remember 'cause
everything's hazy, but I probably do have a cold.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	I guess you get colds too, huh?	
Message	Shido	Hey, what do you mean by that?	
Message	Tonomachi	"I mean, you know the saying, "Itsuka doesn't catch
colds?""	
Message	Shido	There's no saying like... *a-choo*!	
Message	None	(Okay... This is definitely a cold.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ah, I see. A cold. Yes, of course... So you've
gotten sick. I see, I see."	
Message	None	(...Why's this idiot looking so happy?)	
Message	Tonomachi	"In a time like this, I personally must take you to
the infirmary. That's the duty of a sworn friend."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Man, and I had plans, too... but you're my friend,
you know? This sucks so bad... friendship
suuuuucks."	
Message	Tonomachi	...Hehehe.	
Message	Shido	"You just laughed, didn't you?
In such a creepy way..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"What are you talking about, Itsuka-kun? How could
I be happy when a dear friend is ill? Now then,
let's go to the dream infirmary!"	
Message	Shido	...Huh? What dream infirmary?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Are you that dumb, Itsuka-kun?! The infirmary
means Tohka-sensei!"	
Message	Shido	...Tohka-sensei?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yes. The mistress of the infirmary, Tohka
Yatogami-sensei!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... I-Is that so? The young teacher that just
joined the school, right...?"	
Message	None	"(I don't remember when she first started, but
she's a young and pretty teacher who became
popular among the students.)"	
Message	None	"(I heard the infirmary's been more crowded than
usual because of her.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, seriously, you really do seem sick. Forget
what I want. I'll go with you."	
Message	Shido	"You just admitted that you have ulterior motives!
It's fine. I can go to the infirmary on my own."	
Message	Shido	Besides, class is about to start.	
Message	Shido	...See, there's the bell.	
Message	Tonomachi	B-But, Itsuka! Are you really all right?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I don't think it's that bad...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Grr... Damn it! Then I'll tell the teacher that
you went to the infirmary. I don't want you
to faint or anything."	
Message	None	"(I guess despite his ulterior motives, he really
was worried.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay. Thanks.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Take care. And you'd better tell me about Tohka-
sensei tomorrow!"	
Message	None	(I guess... he's still worried about me?)	
Message	Shido	...I feel like my fever's going down.	
Message	None	"(But just walking to the infirmary was tiring.
Maybe it's because of this cold.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I guess I can take some meds and sleep it
off... Excuse me."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Oh, Shido-kun. What's the matter?	
Message	None	"(So this is Tohka Yatogami-sensei. She's pretty,
smart, and down-to-earth. A great teacher.)"	
Message	Shido	I feel a bit sick... Is it okay if I rest here?	
Message	Tohka	What? A cold? That's not good.	
Message	Shido	It's just a normal cold...	
Message	Tohka	"You shouldn't underestimate it. You know...
illnesses are... the root of... you know?"	
Message	Shido	...The root of many illnesses?	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! That!	
Message	None	"(...Huh? My image of her was smart and capable for
some reason...)"	
Message	Tohka	"But fear not. Just leave it to me, Shido! I mean,
Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	"I was thinking that earlier, but now I'm suddenly
worried."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. That's not good. Your condition must have
worsened."	
Message	Shido	"What, are you serious?! It's clearly not a symptom
of a cold!"	
Message	Tohka	"Heh... The cold is making you say such nonsense,
Shido-kun. I said so, so it must be true. Besides,
I am the nurse! And I have glasses on!"	
Message	Shido	I don't think the glasses do anything...	
Message	Tohka	It's fine, just stay put. Got it?	
Message	Shido	...O-Okay.	
Message	None	(Tohka-sensei put her hand on my forehead.)	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Her cool hand and how close she was made my heart
pound.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm... You do seem to have a fever.	
Message	Shido	"Oh... I knew it. And my head hurts, I have a runny
nose... *a-choo*!... And I'm sneezing."	
Message	Tohka	I see. This is pretty bad.	
Message	Shido	It is?!	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, it is. We need to have you treated
this instant."	
Message	Shido	"Th-Then... Um, if I can take some meds and just
lie down..."	
Message	Tohka	"Now, wait. First, I must examine you. You sit
there, Shido-kun."	
Message	Shido	*Sigh*... Okay.	
Message	Tohka	"Hmmm... Your complexion seems a bit flushed. Now
open your mouth."	
Message	Shido	Okay... Ahhh....	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... Okay... It doesn't look like you have any
cavities."	
Message	Shido	"Why are you looking for cavities?! You should be
checking for a swollen throat!"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, really?! Yes, you're right. Okay. It doesn't
seem swollen."	
Message	None	"(...Is she really a capable teacher? I've only
seen reasons to worry thus far...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Next, we're going to take your temperature!
Judging from one's hand isn't enough!"	
Message	Shido	Okay. Then... can I get a thermometer...	
Message	Shido	Wait, Tohka-sensei?!	
Message	None	(*Thunk*... She put her forehead on mine.)	
Message	Shido	S-So close...!	
Message	None	"(Tohka-sensei's porcelain cheeks and plump lips
are right in front of me...!)"	
Message	Tohka	"Stay still, Shido-kun. This is the best way to
take your temperature."	
Message	Shido	Th-There's no way...	
Message	Tohka	Hm. 99 degrees.	
Message	Shido	Is that accurate?!	
Message	Tohka	"My forehead has the ability to measure accurate
temperatures. Because I am the nurse!"	
Message	Shido	I've never heard of a nurse having those abilities!	
Message	Tohka	Okay... Next, show me your stomach, Shido-kun.	
Message	Shido	She's not even listening... Okay, fine.	
Message	None	"(I've talked so much, I feel like my condition's
getting worse...)"	
Message	None	"(I lifted my shirt, and Tohka-sensei put her
stethoscope on my chest―)"	
Message	Shido	...Ah!	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, hmm. Uh-huh...	
Message	Shido	"Um, excuse me?! Where are you putting that
stethoscope?! I totally made a weird noise
just now."	
Message	Tohka	"D-Don't worry. I-I am a teacher. Of course I can
handle seeing your bare body! I'm not nervous
at all!"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, you're totally looking in the other
direction! You have to check me thoroughly!"	
Message	Tohka	"S-So you want me to... look? If you say so,
Shido-kun... I will cooperate and look at all
the areas you find embarrassing...!"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, you're making me sound like I'm requesting
something weird!"	
Message	Shido	"I...It's fine, sensei. Please, just give me some
meds and I'll sleep it off."	
Message	Shido	*A-choo*!	
Message	Tohka	"...! I knew it. You're in grave condition,
Shido-kun... Don't worry! I can treat you!"	
Message	Shido	"No, like I said, it's just a cold... Um,
Tohka-sensei? Why are you taking
gauze out of the cabinet?"	
Message	Tohka	"When things are as grave as this, it's natural to
use gauze! This is how I will treat you,
Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	But, it's pointless to use that on a cold!	
Message	Tohka	You'll be all right now. Leave it to me.	
Message	Tohka	"So I do this... and then this... huh? How odd...?
No, if I do this here... Hm? ARGH! HERE!"	
Message	Shido	W-Wait... Sensei...!	
Message	Tohka	Hm...? Hmmm, what's going on...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! What are you doing?!	
Message	Tohka	"I-It's fine. I'll take this hand and... hm, that's
weird. But this time this is... Aww... mmm. AHHH!"	
Message	Tohka	"Then I'll use this...! Mm... Ah... mmm... Hmm...
Th-This is odd..."	
Message	Shido	S-Sensei, let me help you.	
Message	Tohka	"I-It's fine! I'm the teacher... Mm... kuu... Mm.
Shido-kun... Y-You... just watch... there..."	
Choice		Just watch without helping.	
Choice		Help Tohka.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Whatever you say.	
Message	Tohka	"Mm... Th-That's it... There―Mmph! Y-You watch!
I-I'll undo it right now... Ah!"	
Message	None	(Wh-Why is she making those sounds...)	
Message	Tohka	"Sh-Shido kun, you... just... watch...
there... Ooh."	
Message	Shido	"Um, sensei... I feel like I'm about to see a lot
of things I shouldn't..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm...?!	
Message	Tohka	D-Don't look! Don't look, Shido-kun!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay!	
Message	None	(I hastily turned my back toward her.)	
Message	Tohka	"Hu... *grunt*... I-If I can take this off... Ah!
No! This time, this side is... hyah! Oof!"	
Message	Tohka	"I-It's digging in... A...ha...a...a! I-I can't...
this isn't... Nooo!"	
Message	None	"(Gosh... Not being able to see what's going on
makes it sound even worse...!)"	
Message	Tohka	"Mm...! ...F...nn...NNNN! AH! M...mmmmm...!
*pant, pant*..."	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	Tohka	"Oh... Ya...! No! This is... m...mmm...
*pant, pant*...!"	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	Tohka	"...Mua...m...ah...ha...mmm! ...*pant*...
Sh-Shido...kun."	
Message	Shido	...Yes?	
Message	Tohka	H...Help me, please...	
Message	None	(I knew she'd say that...)	
Message	Tohka	"...Th-That's right. Right there... more... mm!
Ah... *pant*... Yes... th-there...!"	
Message	Tohka	No... More... gently... please.	
Message	Tohka	*Pant*... Mm... A-Aaaaah...	
Message	Shido	This is the last one...!	
Message	Tohka	Ah... Ha... Mmm!	
Message	Shido	"Seriously, this is impossible for you to get out
of alone. I'll help!"	
Message	Tohka	Aww... B-But, I'm the teacher...	
Message	None	"(Tohka-sensei moved her body about for a moment
before promptly giving up...)"	
Message	Tohka	"...I don't think I can get out on my own...
Shido-kun, please help me..."	
Message	Shido	"If you're that tangled up, of course you can't.
Let me help you now."	
Message	Shido	"Um... where should we start...
...Oh."	
Message	Tohka	"What's the matter, Shido-kun? You must hurry and
get me out of this."	
Message	Shido	"Um... well... I feel like I might see a lot of
inappropriate things..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm...?
...
...!"	
Message	Tohka	D-Don't look, Shido-kun!	
Message	Shido	B-But... I need to see, or I can't help you...	
Message	Tohka	"*Whimper*... Th-Then... Try not to look so much
while you help me."	
Message	Shido	I-I'll... try.	
Message	None	"(That's going to be super difficult. But I can't
just stare at her like this.)"	
Message	None	"(I tried my best to not look at her as I reached
out toward the gauze.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Haah! N-Not there... If you pull on that, it won't
be good... a-ahhh!"	
Message	Shido	S-S-S-Sorry! Then, how about here?	
Message	Tohka	"Ahh! Sh-Shido-kun... It's rubbing up against me...
It's no good...!"	
Message	Shido	Th-Then, here...?!	
Message	Tohka	Yahh! *pant*...	
Message	Shido	Then, here...!	
Message	Tohka	"Ah...mmm... You can't do so much there.
Th-That tickles...?!"	
Message	None	"(*Whimper* I'm looking away, so I don't really
know what I'm doing. But I know for sure it's
inappropriate!)"	
Message	Shido	Th-Then, how about this...!	
Message	Tohka	"Hah... ha...ah...mmm! Mmm...*pant*!
Ah, ahhh... haaah!"	
Message	Shido	Argh! How about this?!	
Message	Tohka	Hey... Don't pull so hard... Nooo!	
Message	Shido	U...Uggh!	
Message	Shido	Somehow... I managed to do it...!	
Message	Tohka	Yeah... Um... Shido-kun. Th-Thank... you...	
Message	Shido	No... I'm sorry about that.	
Message	Tohka	"N-No... It's fine. I-I'm the one... who should
be... apologizing."	
Message	Shido	Well... um... fa...	
Message	Tohka	...Fa?	
Message	Shido	...Fa...*FACHOOO*!	
Message	Tohka	Shido-kun?!	
Message	Shido	Aww... M-My head... hurts...	
Message	None	"(That's right. I have a cold. Moving so much
is only going to aggravate it.)"	
Message	Shido	C-Crap... I'm feeling cold...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido-kun...?! We can't help it... We'll have to
go into surgery!"	
Message	Shido	We can't do that! Give me some meds! MEDS, please!	
Message	Tohka	"B-But... It got worse because of me. I feel like
it's not enough to just give you some medication."	
Message	Shido	"No, giving me the medication and letting me
sleep... is something I'd appreciate the most...
P-Please..."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm... F-Fine...	
Message	Shido	F-Finally... I can rest...	
Message	None	"(That was horrible... I lay down on the bed and
closed my eyes.)"	
Message	None	"(Next to the bed, Tohka-sensei sat and watched
over me. I closed my eyes and felt like I could
still see her expression.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hurry up and get better, Shido-kun. I'll watch
over you."	
Message	None	(Haha... Tohka... is Tohka no matter what―.)
