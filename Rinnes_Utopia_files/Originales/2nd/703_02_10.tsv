Guess the rumor spread quick."

Message	Tonomachi	"Hm, am I wrong? A new dessert is being sold
this week in the cafeteria?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Girls love sweets after all! I'll do my research,
then spring it into conversation at the best
opportunity."	
Message	Shido	"The only thing I can't compete with you in
is passion. So what's the dessert?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Heh, we all have our strengths. Since we're such
good friends, I'll tell you the secret. Here!"	
Message	Shido	..."Soymilk pudding"?	
Message	Tonomachi	"That's right! Cheap and nutritious!
Truly the ideal snack."	
Message	Tonomachi	"There's no mistake that it'll become the topic
of conversation in the cafeteria!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oops. I can't stay long. I requested the Home
Economics club to revise the soymilk pudding

Message	Tonomachi	See ya, Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	"Unless it's a culinary masterpiece, I doubt girls
