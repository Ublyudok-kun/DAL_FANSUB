Message	None	"(Kurumi rarely asks me to go home with her, but today
she did.)"	
Message	None	"(Usually one of us just waits for the other without
saying anything, so I think it's been a while since we
verbally agreed to do so.)"	
Message	None	"(As usual, I talked about random things with Kurumi.
Sometime during our casual conversation, we arrived
at the park.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. I wanted to ask you something.	
Message	None	"(When I tried to cut through the park, Kurumi suddenly
stopped.)"	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	You see... I've always wanted to thank you, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Thank me?	
Message	Kurumi	That's right.	
Message	None	"(I thought she was making fun of me as usual. But it
seemed like Kurumi was serious.)"	
Message	Shido	Um... Did I do anything to deserve your thanks?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. You have... So many things that I can't count
them all."	
Message	Shido	So many things?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes... You gave me a lot of time.	
Message	None	(Kurumi stopped there.)	
Message	Kurumi	You brought me a lot of happy times.	
Message	None	"(In the end, she smiled with the most peaceful and
soft expression. It seemed so fleeting, I was
surprised to feel my heart flutter.)"	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to thank me for anything. I mean, I
should be the one thanking you."	
Message	None	"(I was being honest, but Kurumi gave me a serious
look as she continued.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"This is like my penance. Shido-san, you've listened to
so many of my requests."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	So now, Shido-san... Please, ask anything of me.	
Message	Shido	Oh, man...	
Message	None	"(I don't think Kurumi is going to budge on this. I
thought about it and came up with an idea.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay... Then, I've made up my mind.	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. Anything.	
Message	Shido	"I want you to meet me in front of Tengu Station this
Sunday at 9 AM."	
Message	Kurumi	Huh... Is that all?	
Message	Shido	"Well, there's more... But I just want you to promise
me that."	
Message	Kurumi	"I don't understand, but if it's something that will
make you happy, then I'll do it."	
Message	Shido	"All right then. It's set. You'd better not back out at
the last minute, okay?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Have I ever been late to anything? Shido-san, you had
better not oversleep, or you'll ruin it."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I'll be careful. Will you give me a wake-up
call...?"	
Message	Kurumi	Nope.	
Message	Shido	Haha... You sure are strict.	
Message	Kurumi	I can't spoil you too much.	
Message	Shido	Heh... Hahaha.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe...	
Message	None	(And so, we made plans for next Sunday.)	
Message	None	(Before I knew it, Sunday had arrived.)	
Message	Shido	All right, I'm on time.	
Message	Shido	Uh... Where's Kurumi... Oh, there she is. Kurumi!	
Message	None	"(Kurumi noticed me, and just like last time, she
smiled adorably and waved at me.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, good morning.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, morning. Did you wait long?	
Message	Kurumi	No, I just arrived.	
Message	Kurumi	So, Shido-san... May I ask something?	
Message	Shido	Sure.	
Message	Kurumi	This... seems to be like a normal date?	
Message	Shido	Uh, yeah it is.	
Message	Kurumi	"But, that's not any different from any other day. In
that case, I want you to make another wish..."	
Message	Shido	No, it's fine. This... is what I wished for.	
Message	Kurumi	...What?	
Message	None	"(I felt embarrassed, so I scratched my cheek. I looked
Kurumi straight in the eye and continued.)"	
Message	Shido	"I want to go on a normal date with a girl named Kurumi
Tokisaki. I want to spend time with her and have fun."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"I know it seems simple, but I want to keep doing
these things with you. You shouldn't feel like that's
unfair."	
Message	Kurumi	But then...	
Message	Shido	"I don't care if you're not satisfied with that. I
mean, what's wrong with you feeling happiness? I just
want you to accept this happiness."	
Message	Kurumi	But I...!	
Message	Shido	"As long as I'm with you, that's all that matters. Is
that... not the same for you, Kurumi?"	
Message	Kurumi	―?!	
Message	Shido	"I'm happy. You said you were happy too. Isn't that
enough? Nothing else matters."	
Message	None	"(Hearing me say that, Kurumi turned red to her ears
and looked away from me.)"	
Message	None	(For a second, silence flowed between us.)	
Message	None	"(I quietly looked at Kurumi looking away... I feel
like I've never seen her like this.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"I-I... feel the same way. As long as I'm with you,
that's all that matters... I feel that way to my very
core."	
Message	Shido	"...I see. Then you don't need to thank me for
anything. If we just put it to words, I think that's
all that matters. We just want to be happy."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. You're so romantic...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi blushed as she looked up at me. She looked
so adorable. I grabbed her hand.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Ah... Hey, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Let's go, Kurumi. That's what we're here for!	
Message	Kurumi	―H-Hey, wait!	
Message	None	"(Now, where should we go? I'm going to look for fun
things to do with Kurumi.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san! Before that, may I say something?	
Message	Shido	Sure, what is it?	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you. Thanks to you... I'm very, very happy.	
Message	Shido	"I'm thankful, too. I'm so happy just having you by my
side. Come on. Let's go, Kurumi."	
Message	Kurumi	Okay!	
Message	None	"(Maybe we should be thanking God for bringing us
together.)"	
Message	None	"(Regardless, because I'm so happy, I need to say,
"Thank You.")"	
Message	None	"(Because those words are more important than anything,
words you say from your heart.)"
