Message	Shido	"Hmm-hmmm. I'm here five minutes earlier than our
planned meeting time. I really want to make a good
impression on our first date."	
Message	Shido	"...The weather is nice. This is a perfect day for a
date. Ah, I can't wait. I wonder what she's going to
wear today."	
Message	Tonomachi	Hey, Itsuka, is that you? What are you doing here?	
Message	Shido	Oh, that voice sounds like Tonomachi's.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, are you shopping alone? I can tag along if you
want, Itsuka-kyun."	
Message	Shido	"Your creepy game is still strong. Sorry, but I have
plans with someone. I can't go shopping with you."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Aww, what? You have plans? Ah, so you're going on a
date with someone, huh? Ugh, you womanizer! You're
mankind's enemy!"	
Message	Shido	"Don't be like that. I mean, since when is going on a
mere date a crime?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ugh. A mere date? I guess Mr. Popular is not like us
commoners. How can you go on dates with people
left and right? I'm so jealous, you bastard!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tonomachi. You're too loud.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Sorry. But Itsuka, I'm going to warn you as your friend.
Make sure you limit how much of the game you play.
Later."	
Message	Shido	I know, jeez... Tonomachi's over-exaggerating.	
Message	Shido	Whoa, seems like she's here. Hey, Yuzuru! Over here!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Arrived. Shido, I'm sorry for the wait... Were you
here long?"	
Message	Shido	"No, no, I just got here. I was just a little earlier than
you."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Relief. I'm glad to hear that... What's the matter,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, your outfit, Yuzuru... It's adorable. It suits you.	
Message	Yuzuru	"E-Embarrassment. Shido, you're making me blush in
front of everyone. But... thank you. That makes me
happy."	
Message	None	"(Hehe. Yuzuru is so innocent and adorable. She must
be nervous to be on our first date.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. Wh-What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Hehe. I was just thinking how adorable you are. Just
enjoying the view."	
Message	Yuzuru	...Blushing. Gosh, Shido. Let's hurry and go.	
Message	None	"(She must have thought I was making fun of her.
Yuzuru blushed and started to walk.)"	
Message	None	"(Of course Yuzuru knew I wasn't making fun of her.
She happily linked arms with me. She's so cute. I'm
going to be sweet on her all day today.)"	
Message	???	Could that be... What's going on?	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, what... is the meaning of this?	
Message	Shido	Crap, Kaguya!	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. Shido, who's this?	
Message	None	"(Th-This isn't good. This is really not good. Who'd
have thought I'd bump into Kaguya while I was out
with Yuzuru?)"	
Message	Shido	K-Kaguya. Listen to me. This is, um...	
Message	Kaguya	"I-I see. So there's a reason you're rushing to make
excuses. I mean, you guys are so close and she has
her arm around yours... right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Jealousy. "Kaguya"? You sure seem to be addressing
her in a casual way. Shido, please introduce her to
me."	
Message	Shido	"Ouch, ouch, ouch! I'll talk, I'll talk, so don't pinch
me! Yuzuru!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Anger. Despite having Yuzuru, you sure are greedy.	
Message	Kaguya	"I-I see. So her name is Yuzuru, huh? Shido. Of
course you're going to explain. What kind of
whispered intimacies have you had with that woman?"	
Message	None	"(What is she blabbering about... Now isn't the time to
even be thinking that.)"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait, Kaguya. This is all a misunderstanding.
Ouch, ouch! Y-Yuzuru, not so hard!"	
Message	None	"(Damn it, how did it end up like this. I was trying so
hard to make sure they didn't bump into each other.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"You can't tell me, huh? So it must be exactly what it
looks like. Shido, despite having me already..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Disdain. You cheated on me with her.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well, um... I-I guess that's the case? Haha.
Hahahaha."	
Message	None	"(Th-This really isn't good. It's dangerous. I need to
get out of this situation somehow.)"	
Message	Ai	Did you hear? He cheated.	
Message	Mai	What a low-life. Womankind's enemy.	
Message	Mii	Worth thousands of deaths.	
Message	None	(Ugh. People are starting to gather.)	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, you two? Why don't we go somewhere else?
Let's talk in a civil manner. Okay?"	
Message	Kaguya	I'm totally fine doing it here.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Yuzuru agrees with that conniving cat. And
besides, all it takes is for you to just break up with
the girl who has it wrong... Hehe."	
Message	Kaguya	"O-Oh-ho. That is interesting. You're going to be the
one dumped and running home with mascara streaks
all over your face!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Pity. I guess what's unfortunate isn't just your chest
but your head, too."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hey, you clump of fat. Let go of Shido now and I'll
pretend I didn't hear you."	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Shido. Choose right now.	
Message	Kaguya	"Me or that confused woman. Who are you going to
choose, Shido?!"	
Message	None	"(C-Crap. There's no way around this. What do I do?
Is there anything I can do? Is there a good way to
avoid this situation...?)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, Tonomachi! What perfect timing. Notice me!
Over here! Help me, do something!)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, he noticed. Hm... He's moving his lips and saying
something...)"	
Message	Tonomachi	Die... It... Su... Ka.	
Message	None	"(Die... It... su... ka...
Die, Itsuka?!)"	
Message	None	(W-Wait, Tonomachi. Don't be like that. Help me!)	
Message	None	(Damn it, he left.)	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, what are you looking at? Hurry up and answer
me. If you do, I'll forgive your cheating for today."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. Shido, answer me. Tell that back-alley cat to
go home."	
Message	Kaguya	"What did you say?! Just because your breasts are
big and cute! I don't blame Shido for falling for you."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Envy. You must have mesmerized Shido with your
style and cuteness. I understand, but I won't back
down!"	
Message	Kaguya・Yuzuru	Shido.	
Message	None	(*Grunt*... What do I do. I... I...!)	
Choice		I love Kaguya.	
Choice		I love Yuzuru.	
Choice		I can't choose!	
Message	Shido	I love Kaguya. So... Sorry, Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"...Understood. I'm sad, but if that's who you choose,
I can't do anything about it."	
Message	Yuzuru	Separation. Shido, this is the end for us. Good-bye...!	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yuzuru...!	
Message	None	(Yuzuru ran off. Of course I couldn't run after her.)	
Message	Shido	Kaguya. Um, sorry. I...	
Message	Kaguya	"It's fine. Shido, I understand. You chose me. That
makes me really happy. But..."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kaguya! Hm? But...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Whether I can forgive your cheating is a different
story!"	
Message	Shido	...Oh, I thought so.	
Message	None	"(In the end, maybe there wasn't an option where all
would end well.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, you idiot! Forget you!	
Message	Shido	W-Wait, Kaguya!	
Message	None	"(That day, I ran after Kaguya and apologized to her
until the sun went down.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Kaguya. But I'm serious about Yuzuru.	
Message	Kaguya	"...Th-That's so messed up, Shido. So you're saying
you were just playing with me?"	
Message	Shido	W-Well, that's not it...	
Message	Yuzuru	Repeat. That's not it? Then what is it?	
Message	Shido	Oh, well, it does mean that, but...	
Message	Kaguya	Shido...? So you were playing?	
Message	Shido	"No, I didn't mean I was playing. I was really close to
getting serious, actually..."	
Message	None	"(The more I talked the worse it got. It was like
quicksand.)"	
Message	Kaguya	...I'm going home. Good-bye, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kaguya!	
Message	None	"(And Kaguya left. Yuzuru remained as she gave me a
look of doubt.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Reward. I guess I was happy that you chose me.	
Message	Shido	Yuzuru...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Addendum. However, you seemed to be really close
to being serious with her..."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt* Well, that was just a figure of speech...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. Shido. We should end it as of today, too.
I don't want to hear anything you have to say right
now... Good-bye."	
Message	Shido	Yuzuru! Please, forgive me!	
Message	None	"(I guess I'm paying the price for two-timing them. In
one day, I lost two girlfriends.)"	
Message	Shido	Yuzuru～ Please! Forgive me!	
Message	Shido	I love both of you, so I can't choose!	
Message	Kaguya	...	
Message	Yuzuru	...	
Message	None	"(I couldn't help but blurt it out! What will the end
result be?!)"	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, you low-life. I trusted that you'd choose me...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Despicable. You're horrible, Shido... Your half-assed
kindness can still hurt people."	
Message	Ai	Trash.	
Message	Mai	That's an insult to trash.	
Message	Mii	"We should create a bracket called "Shido Itsuka" next
to "Trash"."	
Message	None	"(So it didn't work. One hell of a comeback. I guess
having both at the same time would have been too
convenient...)"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, you two. Please, give me another chance!	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, I wanted you to choose me before... But I have
no more chances to give to you."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Shido, you couldn't choose. The choice is
everything."	
Message	Ai	"I mean, he shouldn't be two-timing in the first
place."	
Message	Mai	And he tried to get them both.	
Message	Mii	Obvious payback.	
Message	Kaguya	Good-bye Shido. It's over for us.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Breakup. Shido, let's break up. I can't be with you
anymore."	
Message	Shido	Wait. Please wait, you guys! Forgive me～!	
Message	None	(My scream resounded through the plaza.)
