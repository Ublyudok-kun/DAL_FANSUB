Message	Reine	Oh? This is... odd.	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter, Reine? Did something change?	
Message	Reine	"I can't access the game system directly, so I used
little tricks here and there to analyze the data,
but... The ""other side"" is approaching us."	
Message	Kotori	"The other side?! Wait, so that Spirit—the AI
Spirit... You're telling me it contacted you?!"	
Message	Reine	I don't know what to call it, but look at this.	
Message	Kotori	"""What's this? ""Please come here to love Shido
Itsuka."" That's all...?"""	
Message	Reine	"Yeah. I tried, but there's no way for us to reply.
After the message, the other devices began moving.
It seems only certain people are granted access."	
Message	Kotori	"Access... So in other words... we're supposed
to go to the VR world? "	
Message	Reine	"I believe so. They're so kind that they're even
providing us with a list of people who are granted
access."	
Message	None	Tohka Yatogami, Yoshino, Kurumi Tokisaki,	
Message	None	Kotori Itsuka, Kaguya Yamai, Yuzuru Yamai,	
Message	None	Miku Izayoi, Origami Tobiichi.	
Message	Kotori	"I wonder what this is based on. The Spirits that
Shido had sealed...? No, but Kurumi and Origami
are on the list as well."	
Message	Reine	"It looks like it's a list of the girls surrounding
Shin. I would assume so, since Origami Tobiichi
was included, despite not being a Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	...I see.	
Message	Reine	"""What is love?""\nShe was asking Shido that question right before we\nwere cut off from him."	
Message	Reine	"If we are going to take this literally, she's
inviting girls who love Shin in order to
learn what love is... perhaps."	
Message	Kotori	...Maybe.	
Message	Kotori	"Forgetting about Origami Tobiichi for a second,
but what if it's a trap to lure in all the
Spirits?"	
Message	Reine	Hard to say... I can't deny that it's possible.	
Message	Kotori	"But... it seems like we have to do it in order
to save Shido."	
Message	Reine	"It does seem so. It's dangerous, but we have to
comply."	
Message	Tohka	"I don't understand what is happening, but I'm
going! All I have to do is go inside the ""geme
and save Shido, right?!"""	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I... want to go too! Shido-san saved me so many
times. This time... It's my turn to save him!"	
Message	Yoshinon	Woo-hoo! Yoshino, you're so bold! To declare\nyour love for Shido-kun in this dramatic fashion!	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon...!	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Shido Itsuka belongs to the Yamais. If
they dare to take something from us, it's only
natural that we'd go to hell and back for it...!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Whether or not it's some type of AI
Spirit, I'm not letting her have Shido."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I guess that's that. Reine, any issues with
connecting to the device? Normally this is for one
person, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... Now that you mention it, it does look to be
set up for only one person."	
Message	Reine	"That won't be a problem. It isn't an entirely new
function to this system, after all."	
Message	Reine	"It was originally designed to let multiple users
log in at the same time. But, it would result in
such a large data transfer that I was refraining..."	
Message	Reine	"If it's telling us to come, then I imagine that we
don't have to worry. Although, I have no idea
what's going on in the virtual world. Be careful."	
Message	Kotori	"I know we're probably walking into a trap,
but this is the only way to save that idiot...
For Ratatoskr, I mean."	
Message	Kotori	"A-And besides... I-If we're talking about love,
then I'd... be first. Since I'm his family..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Kotori, what did you say? I couldn't hear you.	
Message	Kotori	Shut up! I didn't say anything!	
Message	Kotori	"But if it asked for all of us, then we'll need to
find the other ding dongs. Origami we can get,
but... How do we get ahold of Kurumi?"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido saw her today, right? Then that means she
should be somewhere in Tengu City..."	
Message	Kotori	Kannazuki!	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes! I am already searching Tengu City.	
Message	Yoshinon	Woooow! Where did this guy come from?!\nAmazing! It's amazing, but super creepy!	
Message	Kannazuki	"O-Oh... This is awesome. But I'd love for Yoshino
herself to talk down to me—"	
Message	Kotori	KAN-NA-ZU-KI.	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes... Um, nothing, Commander.	
Message	Kotori	"Whatever. You keep it up. Okay, Origami Tobiichi
first... Let's call her from Shido's phone."	
Message	Origami	...Shido? It's so rare for you to be calling me...\nBut I'm happy.	
Message	Kotori	Unfortunately, I'm not Shido. I'm sorry.	
Message	Origami	Kotori... Itsuka.	
Message	Kotori	"I'm sure you can assume based on this situation,
but there was an accident. In order to save Shido,
I need your hel—"	
Message	Origami	—Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"...How very helpful that you're so quick. I'm
warning you now, your life will be at risk as
well."	
Message	Origami	No problem.	
Message	Kotori	"I see... Well, head someplace remote. I'll find
you and send someone over."	
Message	Origami	Roger.	
Message	Kotori	...Origami Tobiichi is accounted for.	
Message	Kannazuki	"But Commander, is it all right to invite an AST
member into the Fraxinus?"	
Message	Kotori	"This is an emergency, it can't be helped. I'm sure
we'll have to blindfold her and send someone to
fetch her so we don't reveal too much information."	
Message	Kotori	"Kannazuki... Just in case, cut this line from the
others."	
Message	Kannazuki	Understood. Then...	
Message	Kannazuki	 —Huh? What is...	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter? If you're going to say
something stupid again, I'm going to pluck all the
hair from your head and turn it into sideburns."	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, I'd love that! Please do it now!	
Message	Kotori	What?! Did you say something?	
Message	Kannazuki	Ahh... I love this side of you, Commander... 	
Message	Kannazuki	" Oh. I've gotten Origami Tobiichi.
I will transfer her."	
Message	Origami	I'm here. Is this place it?	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Seems like you were looking for me too, so
I'll come along."	
Message	Kotori	Kurumi! How did you—	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, weren't you looking for me?	
Message	Kotori	Well yeah, but...	
Message	Kurumi	"Seems like this is about Shido-san. I figured I
could lend my cooperation, to a certain extent."	
Message	Kotori	"...I see. It kinda sounds like you're doing it on
a whim, but I appreciate it. We need to act
quickly."	
Message	Kurumi	"Is that so? Hehe... It's an honor to be of
assistance."	
Message	Kotori	Are you the real one?	
Message	Kurumi	"Does it really matter?
My, what a nasty glare you have..."	
Message	Kotori	...Whatever. Let me brief you. First—	
Message	Kotori	"—And so we need to access the virtual world.
Honestly, I have no idea what we're up against.
This could very likely be a trap."	
Message	Origami	"I told you, it's no problem. If Shido is in
danger, then we should move as soon
as possible."	
Message	Kurumi	"You're right. There's no point stressing over the
unknown... We all want to save Shido-san, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I'm going inside ""geme"" to save Shido!"	
Message	Kotori	Right. You guys... Reine, get ready.	
Message	Reine	"The pod is ready. I'm sure those listed can dive
in with no problem. However..."	
Message	Reine	"Though it looks the same as reality, you're in the
world of electrical brainwaves. With all control
being held by the opposition, anything can happen."	
Message	Kotori	"Got it. First, I'll figure out what they want. And
then... We'll deal with what comes next."	
Message	Kotori	"This is it. God knows we've played plenty of gal
games. But for now... let's head over to our date."
