Message	Tohka	"Ahh, I'm so full! Your food is always great,
Shido!"	
Message	Shido	Of course. Thank you.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, I'm going to gather everyone together
later. Let's meet up and exchange the information
we've picked up."	
Message	Shido	Got it. I'll head over once I finish cleaning.	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Kotori	"...So, with all that said, a full day has passed.
Did you guys notice anything about this world?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	None	(Tohka's hand shot up.)	
Message	Kotori	Yes, Tohka. What is it?	
Message	Tohka	"It's not much different from the real world!
Shido's bento and dinner were both good!"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. Right.	
Message	Tohka	"However, there was a dream-like thing after
school. I was a teacher and Shido was sick."	
Message	Tohka	"I was a really cool teacher, but... something
embarrassing happened..."	
Message	Kotori	I'm not sure I'm following...	
Message	Shido	"Uh... so that dream-like state... It seems like
Arusu was making it happen. She wanted to observe
love in an unusual situation."	
Message	Kotori	"I understand. So it was like an event, was it?
Observe love in an unusual situation...
I see, so an unusual date."	
Message	Kotori	"Arusu is in control of this world... I guess we
can assume she's the manager."	
Message	Miku	"I don't know if it's something we can use in this
world, but should I try my Gabriel on her?"	
Message	Kotori	"Let's not. If it's as I'm assuming, although she's
an AI, she is still a Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	"To top it off, the world we are in is completely
controlled by the opponent. If we mess with her,
God knows what'll happen."	
Message	Kurumi	"Right. I think that's a wise decision, Flame
Spirit-san."	
Message	Kotori	"Why does that rub me the wrong way, coming from
you?"	
Message	Kotori	"It's not the time to be complaining about that.
So from tomorrow onward, let's continue to observe
this world and continue to investigate Arusu."	
Message	Shido	Right, I guess that's all we can do now.	
Message	Kotori	"Okay. That's it, guys. Don't let your guard down,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	Man, today was a long one. So much has happened...	
Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... The night wind feels good.
Not to mention—"	
Message	Arusu	...Shido Itsuka. What are you doing?	
Message	Shido	"Arusu. Oh, I was just getting some fresh air.
Oh... and watching the stars..."	
Message	Arusu	"Stars... So you were observing the hot, gaseous
bodies that exist in the known universe."	
Message	Shido	"Well I guess I was, but not in that way... I was
just thinking that the stars look beautiful,
even in this world."	
Message	Arusu	Beautiful, you say? I do not understand.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, right... You see, just look up... Do you still
not understand?"	
Message	Arusu	They are... shining...	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Arusu	There are some bright stars, and some are not.	
Message	Shido	"You're right. The bright stars and the glimmering
ones are big. Some are closer than others."	
Message	Shido	"And there are also Mars and Jupiter and other
planets near Earth."	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. I know the names of the planetary bodies.
I know all facts set up in this system."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's right... Egg on my face, as if I know
it all."	
Message	Arusu	...No.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Arusu	"I do not know if this is beautiful,
but it's kind of..."	
Message	Shido	Interesting?	
Message	Arusu	"...I don't know. It's an odd... feeling I do not
know. But... I don't mind it."	
Message	Shido	I see. Then that's good.	
Message	Arusu	Shido Itsuka... You know so many strange things.	
Message	Shido	"I don't know about that, Arusu. You definitely
have more knowledge. This world... a world similar
to the real one... you know everything about it."	
Message	Arusu	But... There are many things I don't know.	
Message	Shido	I don't know a lot of things, either.	
Message	Arusu	But Shido Itsuka, you should know what love is.	
Message	Shido	Me? Know love?	
Message	Arusu	"That is the reason why... I want to learn love
from you."	
Message	Arusu	So... please.	
Message	Arusu	"I have a purpose. But it won't be fulfilled unless
I receive your cooperation."	
Message	Arusu	So... Please. Please teach me... love.	
Message	Shido	"Please...? I'm flattered that you feel like you
can depend on me. I'll try to do what I can do."	
Message	Arusu	...Please.	
Message	Shido	"Okay... I don't know if I can, but I'll try
to help you find that answer."	
Message	Arusu	...Okay.	
Message	Arusu	And one more thing...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Arusu	...Um, thank you.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Arusu	You said... that you'd help me...	
Message	Shido	"Haha. I don't know if I can really find it,
though. But I'll try my best."
