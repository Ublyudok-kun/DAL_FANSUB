Message	Tamae	Hm... This is cute, too. So's this one...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Sensei?	
Message	Tamae	"Eeek! Oh, Itsuka-kun... You startled me.
Didn't see you there."	
Message	Shido	"I'm sorry. You looked like you were in serious
thought. Are you looking at cups?"	
Message	Tamae	"Yes. You see, I broke the mug I keep in the
teacher's lounge."	
Message	Shido	Oh, dear...	
Message	Tamae	"I've used it many times, so it's about time
that I replace it."	
Message	Tamae	I know. Itsuka-kun, will you help me choose?	
Message	Shido	Huh, me?	
Message	Tamae	"Yes. I thought if I picked a cup students would
like, they would be more inclined to ask
questions."	
Message	None	"(Hm. I doubt they'd be interested enough in
your cup to answer questions.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, if the teacher's asking... I should try
picking a good one.)"	
Message	Shido	Let me see... What about this?	
Message	Tamae	Oh, my. What a cute cat.	
Message	Shido	It's also a tama-chan, so it kind of fits.	
Message	Tamae	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"...Err! N-Nothing! I just thought it was a cute
cat."	
Message	None	"(That was a close one. I accidentally called
her by her nickname.)"	
Message	Tamae	But it is cute. Okay, I'll choose this one.	
Message	Tamae	Thank you, Itsuka-kun. I'll take good care of it.	
Message	Shido	Yes.	
Message	None	(Well, she seemed satisfied, so I'm glad.)
