Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Is this... a shrine...?	
Message	None	(What am I doing here?)	
Message	None	"(If I'm at a shrine, does that mean I came here to
pray?)"	
Message	Shido	Prayer...	
Message	None	"(Oh, that's right, I remember now! I'm here to
pray for success on my entrance exam.)"	
Message	None	"(I am currently... a student who failed his first
college entrance exam.)"	
Message	None	(I came here to pray for a successful exam.)	
Message	None	"(I have to get in college this year. So I have to
pray with all I've got.)"	
Message	None	(All right, let's do this.)	
Message	None	(...Wait a minute.)	
Message	None	(Seems like someone's inside.)	
Message	None	(Is that... a shrine maiden?)	
Message	None	(She sure is pretty...)	
Message	None	"(I didn't know the shrine had such a beautiful
shrine maiden...)"	
Message	None	(What do I do? Should I say hi to her?)	
Message	None	"(No. I mean, I'm not going to talk to her just
because she's pretty.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm going to pray here, so it's only polite to
pay my respects to the person working here.)"	
Message	Shido	U-Um...	
Message	Origami	Hello.	
Message	Shido	H-Hello. Um, is it okay if I pray here?	
Message	Origami	"Of course. This shrine is good for safety, success
in business, safe births, exorcisms, cursing your
enemies to death, and various other things."	
Message	Shido	Wait... The last one sounded questionable.	
Message	Origami	"Of course, it's also very good for passing
entrance exams."	
Message	Shido	Oh, yes.	
Message	None	"(How weird. Something about her tone made it seem
pretty barbaric. Oh well.)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, well, I've come to pray for
a successful exam."	
Message	Origami	I thought so.	
Message	Shido	Huh? How did you know?	
Message	Origami	I could tell just by looking upon your face.	
Message	Shido	I-I see.	
Message	None	"(Wow, this shrine maiden is amazing. Maybe she has
some sort of sixth sense.)"	
Message	Origami	"Besides, we have many visitors here praying for a
successful entrance exam."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see. Then this shrine must really work.	
Message	Origami	"Not only that, but I was waiting for you to come,
Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Wait, what...? How do you know my name?!	
Message	Origami	"Huh...? Oh yes, I haven't introduced myself yet.
I am Origami Tobiichi. The shrine maiden of this
place."	
Message	Shido	"That's great. But how did you know my name...? Do
you have some kind of supernatural vision...?"	
Message	Origami	"No, I just saw your name on the wooden plaque when
you came to pray last year."	
Message	Shido	Are you serious?! Did I even do that?	
Message	Shido	But still, you remembered my name just from that?	
Message	Origami	"Since I saw you back then, I've had my eyes
on you."	
Message	Shido	Eyes on me... Wait, what? What do you mean?	
Message	Origami	Of course I mean in a sexual way.	
Message	Shido	That sure is direct!	
Message	None	"(It's flattering to have such a beautiful person
say that about me, but she said it with such a
straight face, it was shocking...)"	
Message	Origami	"I prayed that you would come again this year so I
could see you."	
Message	Shido	"What the—! So maybe that had something to do with
my failing..."	
Message	Origami	Maybe, maybe not.	
Message	Shido	Which is it?	
Message	Origami	"No need to rush. I will be introducing a special
prayer to you this year."	
Message	Shido	A special prayer?	
Message	Origami	Yes. The Special Shido Itsuka Prayer.	
Message	Shido	"That's obviously suspicious! Why is my name on the
prayer?"	
Message	Origami	"This one works very well. My wish came true,
at least. See? I got to see you."	
Message	Shido	No, thank you!	
Message	Shido	"All I want is to pass my entrance exam. Shouldn't
I just put money into the donation box and
pray...?"	
Message	Origami	"Unfortunately, I would say it is impossible for
you to pass unless you do the special prayer."	
Message	Shido	It's that bad?!	
Message	Origami	"I have already prayed that I can see you
again next year."	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?!	
Message	None	(What is wrong with this shrine maiden...)	
Message	Origami	"If you want to pass, then you're going to have to
pray with the special prayer and overwrite my
wish."	
Message	Shido	Can I really pass?	
Message	Origami	"If you follow my instructions, I can guarantee
that you'll pass. Those who have done the
special prayer thus far have passed 100%."	
Message	Shido	"100%?! That sounds even more suspicious... Are you
sure?"	
Message	Origami	I swear to God.	
Message	Shido	That's amazing... Then I'll do it.	
Message	Origami	"So you agree? You wish to do the successful
entrance exam prayer?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes... Wait a minute...	
Message	Origami	What...?	
Message	Shido	I'm curious about what that entails.	
Message	Origami	"Don't worry. Just do as I say, and all will
be well."	
Message	Shido	"What if I have to sign some kind of shady contract
and later realize I've agreed to buy something
weird?"	
Message	Origami	"Don't worry, that won't happen. The special prayer
is completely free. Anyone can do it. The only
difference is in the way one prays."	
Message	Shido	I-If that's the case...	
Message	Origami	You want to do it?	
Message	None	"(I've never heard of having to do a special
prayer. Hm... Honestly I'm worried.)"	
Message	None	"(But I guess I have no choice but to do it. I have
to pass this year. If I take too long, I may end
up in the same grade as Kotori.)"	
Message	Origami	What do you want to do?	
Choice		Pray.	
Choice		Don't do it.	
Message	Shido	...Argh, fine! I'll do it! Please!	
Message	Origami	The special prayer?	
Message	Shido	The special prayer!	
Message	None	"(It must be one powerful prayer. That's why I need
it. I'm certain of it.)"	
Message	Origami	Then let's start.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Origami	"First, you're going to put up your pointer finger,
and put your hand on your head."	
Message	Shido	L-Like this...?	
Message	Origami	Pretty good. Now open up your legs.	
Message	Shido	Legs? ...Like this?	
Message	Origami	"No, you want to be more bow-legged. And you should
unzip your fly."	
Message	Shido	Bow-legged... M-My fly, too?!	
Message	Origami	"""Yes. Then roll back your eyes and stick out your
tongue. Then say, ""OPPOSUM! OPPOSSUM!"" And run
around the shrine as fast as you can three times."""	
Message	Shido	"What... Are you serious?! Do I really have
to do that?"	
Message	Origami	I'm kidding, of course.	
Message	Shido	You're kidding?!	
Message	Shido	Take this serious! I mean it!	
Message	Origami	"The path to God must have humor. That's what
Sugawara no Michizane said."	
Message	Shido	That's such a lie!	
Message	None	(Seriously, what is up with this shrine maiden...)	
Message	Origami	Anyways, jokes aside...	
Message	Shido	Seriously... I need you to do good.	
Message	Origami	"If you're going to pray for a successful exam,
first you'll need to close your eyes."	
Message	Shido	"Close my eyes... A-Are you sure about this?
It better not be a joke this time."	
Message	Origami	"If you embody the earthly feeling of fear, your
wish will not come true. Have courage."	
Message	None	"(The shrine maiden's words are the most
suspicious, though.)"	
Message	None	"(Her expression doesn’t change, so it's hard to
tell if it's all a joke or not.)"	
Message	Shido	Well... I'll close my eyes, then.	
Message	Shido	They're closed.	
Message	Origami	Then stay put.	
Message	None	(Huh...? I sense... someone moving.)	
Message	None	(Is she... coming near me?)	
Message	Origami	And stay still.	
Message	None	(So she is coming closer?!)	
Message	None	(Whoa! Close! She's close!)	
Message	None	"(Her breath... It seems like it's grazing
my cheeks?!)"	
Message	None	(...?! Th-This is...?!)	
Message	None	"(Something... very soft seemed to be pushing
against my cheeks... What is it? Could it be...)"	
Message	Origami	All done. You can open your eyes now.	
Message	Shido	Um... Okay.	
Message	None	"(When I opened my eyes, nothing seemed
different...)"	
Message	Shido	Um, what did you do?	
Message	Origami	"Just a little prayer. Besides that, it's a secret.
If you find out, its effects will go away."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	(What did she do to me...?)	
Message	Shido	So this concludes my prayer?	
Message	Origami	Yup. It's over. However...	
Message	Origami	"If you wish, we can go to a secluded place at the
back of the shrine, and do a super special prayer
until the morning."	
Message	Shido	"*Grunt*... That seems dangerous for some reason,
so I will refrain."	
Message	Origami	I see. How unfortunate. I won't force it.	
Message	Shido	Well, I'll be off then...	
Message	None	"(I don't know what's going on, but the prayer's
over now. So I need to go home and study.)"	
Message	Origami	Hold on a moment.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Good luck on your entrance exam.	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*...	
Message	None	"(I turned around, and there stood the shrine
maiden, smiling.)"	
Message	None	(I couldn't help but be rendered speechless.)	
Message	None	(She's so pretty.)	
Message	None	"(And for some reason, she seems approachable.
Although I just met her, there's something
nostalgic about her energy.)"	
Message	Shido	"U-Um, thank you for what you did. I... feel so
much better. I feel like I'll be successful now."	
Message	Origami	I see. I'm glad.	
Message	Shido	I don't think I'll do it.	
Message	Origami	I see. That's unfortunate.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Sorry for the trouble. I'm going to rely not
on God, but on my own skills."	
Message	Origami	Wait. Why don't you try the written oracle?	
Message	Shido	Huh? The written oracle?	
Message	Origami	Yes. It will give you your fortune for next year.	
Message	Shido	"Um... that's kind of scary. If I pull a bad
fortune, then I feel like I'll fail this year,
too."	
Message	Origami	"You won't pass anyway with a negative attitude
like that."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. You have a point there.	
Message	Origami	"If you have bad luck, knowing beforehand will
allow you to work around it. It won't do you
any harm."	
Message	None	(*Grunt*... Her opinion seems legitimate this time.)	
Message	Shido	H-Hm... Then...	
Message	Shido	I guess I'll draw one written oracle.	
Message	Origami	All right. Then, grab that box.	
Message	Shido	"Whoa... nice. So I just shake it, and a stick will
come out with a number on it, right?"	
Message	Origami	"Go ahead. Shake it, and read the text on the stick
that comes out."	
Message	Shido	Okay. YAH!	
Message	Shido	"Okay... uh... ""tawashi""."	
Message	Origami	Congratulations. You won a tawashi.	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	Origami	Here you go.	
Message	Shido	"Hey...?! I thought this was a written oracle?!
Tawashi... it looks like a raffle prize at a
market!"	
Message	Origami	Don't panic. Now look at the tawashi.	
Message	None	(Huh? Look at it...?)	
Message	Shido	Hm... oh, there's a piece of paper on it!	
Message	Origami	"Open the paper and your fortune will be written
inside."	
Message	Shido	That's so roundabout! You didn't need the tawashi!	
Message	Origami	"It's the tradition of this shrine. Don't let it
bother you."	
Message	None	"(If I let everything about this place bother me,
it'd probably be the end of me. A-Anyways, I'll
read the paper. Let's see...)"	
Message	Shido	Hm... Oh!	
Message	Shido	"Wow, ""Great Luck""!"	
Message	Origami	Congratulations.	
Message	Shido	"Nah, I know it's just a fortune, but that makes me
so happy."	
Message	Origami	That's nice.	
Message	None	(Oh... she smiled.)	
Message	None	"(I thought she was pretty before, but when she
smiles, she's even prettier.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm glad I came to this shrine. I was able to
meet a pretty shrine maiden, too.)"	
Message	Shido	Th-Thank you. I'm really glad I came here.	
Message	Origami	"This shrine will always be waiting for you. Please
visit again next year."	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. I'll come again next year to pray for a
successful exam! Wait...?"	
Message	Shido	"The paper oracle overall seemed to be good luck,
but reading the fine print, the ""school luck
says: ""No chance. This is a time to endure!"""""	
Message	Origami	I look forward to seeing you again next year.	
Message	Shido	I-It can't beeeee!	
Message	None	(With that, I left the shrine.)
