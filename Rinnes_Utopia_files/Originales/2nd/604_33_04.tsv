Message	Shido	All right, the living room is clean.	
Message	Shido	I cleaned my room and the bathroom...	
Message	Shido	So all that's left is... the entrance area?	
Message	Shido	"Am I stressing about it too much? Well, I still have
some time before Kurumi comes, so I'll just do it."	
Message	None	"(That day, I was cleaning harder than usual since
Kurumi was going to hang out at my place.)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm... I guess that does it for the entrance.	
Message	Shido	"But man, she told me she wanted to visit so
suddenly..."	
Message	None	(Kurumi called me last night.)	
Message	Shido	Hello, Itsuka residence.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Good evening. I'm sorry to call so late.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi? What's the matter?	
Message	Kurumi	I wanted to ask you something.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Do you have any plans tomorrow?	
Message	Shido	"...Tomorrow? Not really. I was going to just hang out
at home. We're going on a date the day after tomorrow,
right?"	
Message	Kurumi	Then that's perfect!	
Message	Kurumi	You see. I had a favor to ask of you.	
Message	Shido	...A favor?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I've always wanted to visit your room, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Um... So that means...	
Message	Shido	You want to come over?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes... Would it be an inconvenience to you?	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it. It just came out of nowhere, so
I was just surprised."	
Message	Shido	No one's here tomorrow, so feel free to visit.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, how wonderful. Tomorrow, then. I'll visit around
three."	
Message	Shido	Got it. I'll be waiting for you.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... Well, good night, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Okay. See you tomorrow.	
Message	None	(And here we are.)	
Message	Shido	The entrance is good.	
Message	Shido	It's almost time for her to come.	
Message	None	"(I looked at the empty living room and sighed. Kotori
is spending the night at Tohka's place. They planned
it a long time ago.)"	
Message	Shido	So we're alone today...	
Message	None	"(It's not the first time Kurumi's visited out of the blue
and seen our living room, but...)"	
Message	Shido	Comiiiing!	
Message	Kurumi	Hello, Shido-san.	
Message	None	"(I opened the door and Kurumi was standing there
the same way she always has.)"	
Message	Shido	Welcome, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you for letting me visit today.	
Message	Shido	Of course. Do enter, my lady.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Oh, Shido-san...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi smiled and passed through the entrance.
In her hands was a box of cake she seemed to have
brought as a gift.)"	
Message	None	"(We're about to be alone in a room together. Actually
being in this situation made my heart pound so fast.
This is going to be pretty tough...)"	
Message	Shido	Feel free to sit anywhere.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe. So this is your room, huh.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Sorry it's messy.	
Message	Kurumi	Not at all. It's very tidy.	
Message	None	"(It was just an ordinary room, but Kurumi seemed to
be very curious about what was inside.)"	
Message	Kurumi	I see...	
Message	Shido	U-Um... I'm going to go make some tea.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, and I brought some cake. Could I ask you to take
care of this as well?"	
Message	Shido	Thanks. Black tea okay?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, please.	
Message	Shido	"Got it. I have to boil some water, so hang on a
minute."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Feel free to read any magazines or manga lying
around until I get back."	
Message	Kurumi	Okay. So I can read anything?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course. Make yourself at home.	
Message	Kurumi	"...I see. Then I suppose I'll take you up on your
offer."	
Message	None	"(I left Kurumi in my room and headed towards the
living room. I am going to make tea and think over
my game plan.)"	
Message	Shido	Where are the tea leaves―There they are. Okay.	
Message	Shido	So... What to do...	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Kotori bought a new game. I think it has a versus
mode..."	
Message	Shido	...I wonder if Kurumi plays games.	
Message	None	"(I boiled water and prepared two tea cups. I was
saving them for a day like this. I'm sure the cup's
happy that it can finally be used.)"	
Message	Shido	"No, if a girlfriend visits, you shouldn't just play
video games. That feels wrong..."	
Message	None	(Well, I guess some people would prefer that.)	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess I'll be my usual self and talk to her.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I know. It might be nice to plan our next date
together."	
Message	Shido	Um... I mean we are alone...	
Message	None	"(The minute I said that, my train of thought stopped.
That's right. Today, Kurumi and I are alone in the
house.)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	No. No, no. In my room now is―	
Message	None	"(In my room is Kurumi Tokisaki, a very aggressive
and audacious girl. For an instant, I imagined Kurumi
posing in all sorts of ways.)"	
Message	Shido	*gasp*... No, no, no, I can't!	
Message	Shido	"I-I know! I'll discuss the next date with her! Yeah,
we'll be wholesome! Yeah, innocent. Yup!"	
Message	None	"(I tried to restrain myself by stressing that we'd
just have a wholesome and innocent time together as I
brought the tray back to my room.)"	
Message	None	"(When I returned to my room Kurumi seemed to be
looking at a magazine. She seemed very serious. I
put the tray on the table and called for Kurumi.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kurumi. The tea's ready.	
Message	Kurumi	My, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	What magazine are you reading?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, this...? Well...	
Message	Kurumi	"Special Edition: A Lesson in Love - Hot Teacher\nTutors Student in Forbidden Subjects and Grades His\nPerformance in the Bedroom."	
Message	Shido	Ah, that magazine...	
Message	Shido	Wait, what?!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Do you prefer these kinds of situations?	
Message	Shido	No, no, no, no! Anything but that!	
Message	Kurumi	"Especially the scene where the hot teacher looks
enticing and is lifting her skirt, even I―"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi-san, please! DOOOOOON'T!	
Message	None	"(I took the magazine from Kurumi and hid it in my
arms.)"	
Message	Shido	H-How did this book...?!	
Message	Kurumi	"You said I could read whatever I wanted, so I started
with the ones under your bed."	
Message	Shido	Wh-Why did you target that area...?!	
Message	Kurumi	"You have a little sister. I figured you wouldn't have
them in an easily accessible location. And besides..."	
Message	Shido	B-Besides...?	
Message	Kurumi	"Wanting to know your boyfriend's secrets is a very
normal desire."	
Message	Shido	Th-That may be true, but...	
Message	Kurumi	"Anyways... I didn't know you liked these things,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	(Kurumi gave a naughty smile. I gulped and continued.)	
Message	Shido	W-Well... um...	
Message	Kurumi	"The fact that you're hiding it as a
precious thing..."	
Message	Kurumi	 That's what it means, right?	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's not like that... Listen to me, Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	Besides, this book isn't mine. It's Tonomachi's.	
Message	Shido	"He forced it on me... Well, I'm also a wholesome boy,
so I couldn't help it, and..."	
Message	Shido	"Um... I guess there's nothing I could do but hide it
under my bed, and uh..."	
Message	Kurumi	So, Shido-san... Answer my question.	
Message	Shido	Huh? ...What?	
Message	Kurumi	Do you like those kinds of situations?	
Message	Shido	...What?!	
Message	Kurumi	Those poses... Do you not like them, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Well.. um.	
Message	None	"(I neither like them or hate them... I was so nervous,
I didn't know how to answer.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. You can be honest, you know?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi doesn't seem mad. Seeing that, I started to
calm down.)"	
Message	Shido	W-Well, I don't hate it, but...	
Message	Kurumi	My...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, that's your fetish, isn't it?	
Message	Shido	H-Hey wait! It's not a fetish...	
Message	None	"(I blushed and tried to refute her assumptions. Just
then, Kurumi looked naughty and slowly sat down on
my bed.)"	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi...?	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san. You said there was no one else here today,
right?"	
Message	Shido	Well, yeah...	
Message	Kurumi	Then Shido-san... Why don't we do this?	
Message	None	(Kurumi then grabbed her skirt―)	
Message	Shido	―Hey, what are you doing?!	
Message	Kurumi	"My, it's easy. I figured I'd replicate the scene for
you."	
Message	Shido	Re...plicate...	
Message	None	"(The person in the photo and Kurumi in front of me
were both doing the same pose. If she does that, I...)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe... You don't have to restrain yourself,
Shido-san..."	
Message	None	(Kurumi grabbed her skirt once again. I―)	
Choice		Don't tease me!	
Choice		Please.	
Message	Shido	Wha―	
Message	Shido	D-Don't tease me!	
Message	None	"(I blushed and I answered a little angrily. I crossed
my arms and turned away from Kurumi.)"	
Message	None	"(I wasn't really mad. But seeing Kurumi like that, I
got scared that I wouldn't be able to hold myself
back.)"	
Message	Kurumi	My... Did I anger you?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	Hey... Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(This is a good opportunity. I'm going to ignore her
so I can regain my cool.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido...san.	
Message	Kurumi	I'm sorry. I guess I was a little too mean.	
Message	Kurumi	Let me apologize... So please look at me.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi must have read the air and started to panic
a little.)"	
Message	Shido	Well if you feel bad, then I guess―	
Message	None	(I looked towards Kurumi.)	
Message	None	(Seeing Kurumi... I was dumbfounded.)	
Message	Shido	Hey wait, Kurumi! Wh-What are you doing?!	
Message	Kurumi	...Isn't it obvious?	
Message	Kurumi	I'm expressing my apologies toward you.	
Message	Shido	What...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi lifted her skirt and had the same smirk as
she stared into my eyes.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Here, Shido-san... You can come closer to get a better
look..."	
Message	Shido	"K-Kurumi, let's calm down. I think you're confused
right now...!"	
Message	Kurumi	That's not true... Look.	
Message	Shido	S-Stop!	
Message	None	"(I literally covered my eyes. My cheeks were burning
hot.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yef?!	
Message	Kurumi	Look at me.	
Message	None	(I froze. I could see a little through my fingers.)	
Message	None	"(The skirt was being lifted up like a curtain, and
eventually her knees were starting to make an
appearance.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey Kurumi, you can't!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Don't be like that...	
Message	Kurumi	Here... You can see all you want.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe...	
Message	None	"(Eventually she was inching toward the forbidden delta
zone. I couldn't help but stare from between my
fingers.)"	
Message	None	"(Eventually, I felt a spark ignite on the battlefield of
my self-restraint. Ahh... I can't take it anymore! I
charged toward Kurumi!)"	
Message	Shido	N-NO MOREEE!	
Message	Kurumi	...Huh? AH!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi. You've gone too far...	
Message	None	"(I grabbed Kurumi's hand and made her stop. Kurumi
looked confused.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"But I wouldn't have minded if you had just pushed me
down."	
Message	Shido	I mind.	
Message	Kurumi	Gosh... You're such a late bloomer...	
Message	None	(Kurumi pouted as if she were unsatisfied.)	
Message	Shido	W-Well but... I feel like it's too early for that...	
Message	Kurumi	...I see. But I won't just stop it today.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi gave a mischievous giggle, and I couldn't help
but feel my heart flutter.)"	
Message	Shido	P-Please...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi's sensual allure and the whole situation
finally made me say it.)"	
Message	Kurumi	My, my... Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	―Hey! No, I take it back! I was kidding!	
Message	Shido	I-It was a slip of the tongue!	
Message	Kurumi	...Were you really kidding?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	I want you to be honest.	
Message	Shido	S-Stop... Don't, Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi ignored me and slowly started to lift her
skirt.)"	
Message	Shido	*grunt*...	
Message	None	"(As Kurumi lifted her skirt, I saw the black tights that
wrapped around her legs give off a bewitching spark.
I was mesmerized.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe. I can feel the heat of your gaze, Shido-san.	
Message	Kurumi	"Seeing you look at me that way... I'm starting to feel
naughty."	
Message	None	"(Kurumi still kept her sensual gaze on me. As if... she
was luring me in...)"	
Message	Kurumi	Come, Shido-san... Have a closer look...	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi...	
Message	None	"(My mind tells me not to look, but my eyes... I can't
take them off her. That's how bewitching Kurumi is.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Hey, Shido-san...	
Message	Kurumi	You can... come closer, you know.	
Message	Shido	Oh no, I don't think I can do that.	
Message	Kurumi	Then, I'll do it so you can see from there...	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait!	
Message	Kurumi	"Now... you can't. I want you to look even closer and
closer."	
Message	Shido	...*gulp*...	
Message	None	"(And she finally got to the final delta zone. I recalled
the daydream I had back in the living room. What's
going to happen to me? What's going to happen?!)"	
Message	Shido	Hm? A message.	
Message	Kurumi	My, how unfortunate... Someone got in the way.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	None	"(I apologized, but I felt relieved deep inside. I didn't
know what would have happened.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"But... Shido-san, the way you looked at me earlier was
so attractive."	
Message	Kurumi	It was very aggressive.	
Message	Shido	Ha...hahaha.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi and I talked a lot afterwards. How good the
cake tasted, and how the tea got cold while we were
doing all those things... And other things.)"	
Message	Shido	"...Anyways, Kurumi. You have free time after school
the day after tomorrow?"	
Message	Kurumi	"I have some business to take care of. If you don't
mind going out after that."	
Message	Shido	"I see... Come to think of it, I have to finish my
project..."	
Message	Kurumi	Is there something happening that day?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I was wondering if you wanted to watch a movie
with me. You said you wanted to go the other day,
remember?"	
Message	Kurumi	My. You remembered?	
Message	Shido	W-Well... yeah.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... That makes me happy. And...	
Message	Shido	And...?	
Message	Kurumi	I'm very, very happy right now.	
Message	Shido	Me, too.	
Message	None	"(I hugged Kurumi's shoulders tight. We could feel
each other's bodies. That heat alone taught me
something.)"	
Message	Kurumi	So, Shido-san...	
Message	None	"(No matter how much we talk, it's never enough.
It's just so fun to talk to Kurumi. I wish this time
would last forever. I really do.)"	
Message	Kurumi	I really had so much fun today.	
Message	Shido	Me, too.	
Message	Kurumi	...Hehe.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?	
Message	Kurumi	Today... I got to learn your kink. I'm very satisfied.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, it's not like that! That was Tonomachi's...	
Message	None	"(I tried to cover it up, but Kurumi hugged me tightly
and whispered into my ear.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Please decide when you want to continue what we
were doing this afternoon."	
Message	Shido	What...?!	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... Well, good-bye, Shido-san...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi said that much and waved at my bright red
face before walking off.)"
