Message	Yoshino	Oh, Shido-san... Welcome home...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshino. You're already home, huh?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino seems to not be as suntanned anymore.
It was refreshing to see Yoshino like that. She
was adorable...)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, hey, Shido-kuuuun. Are you reminiscing about\nYoshino in her swimsuit? Why don't you see if she\nstill has a tan?"	
Message	Shido	"What?! What are you talking about, Yoshinon?!
Of course I'm not going to do that!"	
Message	Yoshino	...O-Onii-chan. Do you want to see my suntan?	
Message	Shido	"Calm down, Yoshino! Why are you back to being my
cousin!"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...! N-No... I guess I'm still confused.	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, I don't blame you. I am, too. Damn it,
Maria. She's caused such a ruckus... Hey, wait!"	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, I was in the middle of
looking for Maria at school. Did she come
home already?"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, it seems like she's not here yet.	
Message	Shido	Hmm. Let's go find her.	
Message	Shido	Thanks for coming with me, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... It's fine... I'm worried... too.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino. Now's your chance. Helping him is just\nan excuse to do you-know-what!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh... Hehe. Hey, Yoshino, Yoshinon. It's been some
time since we've met Maria... but do you think I'm
doing a good job?"	
Message	Yoshino	What... do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I was just wondering if I'm able to find the
answer to Maria's question."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ohhh you seem to not be as confident as usual.\nWhat's gotten into you, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Shido-san, I... have faith!	
Message	Shido	Faith?	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san... You're the type of person that finds
answers... So I have faith... that we'll get
through this, too."	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right, Shido-kun! Remember the courage\nyou showed when you saved Yoshino."	
Message	Shido	...Thanks, Yoshino. Yoshinon.	
Message	None	"(They're right. This isn't the time to lack
confidence. I gotta do this!)"	
Message	Shido	First, we need to find Maria... Oh, there she is.	
Message	Maria	So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Maria	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Shido	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Maria	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart skips
a beat, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, hey～ We're here too, you know～?"	
Message	Shido	Oh... Sorry, Yoshino, Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Golly, how rude. We came looking for you, too.\nRight, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh... U-Um yes. Shido-san, Arusu-san...
Let's go home."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Let's go home, Maria.	
Message	Maria	Okay.	
Message	None	"(It was a rare moment, but on the way back,
Yoshino took my hand.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hm...? Okay...	
Message	None	"(Maria slowly walked beside me, and I took her
hand. The three of us began to walk home together.
Maria has truly become part of our family.)"	
Message	None	"(We continued to hold each others' hands as we
walked home.)"
