Operator	Comment	Key	Translation
Message	None	(All right. So class has begun, but...)	
Message	None	"(It's nice that Maria is calm, but she seems kind
of bored.)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe I can talk to her quietly... To where it
won't be disruptive to the class.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, Yoshino is focused on teaching. I think
now's a good time... Maria... Maria!"	
Message	Maria	"What is the matter, Shido? Shouldn't you refrain
from talking during class?"	
Message	Shido	"Well yeah, but I was just curious about you. If
you have any questions, you can ask me."	
Message	Maria	"Questions? There is nothing that I need to ask at
this moment."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. You must be smart... But I guess that
would make sense."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, but you can ask about other things. Hmm, like
if you're curious about what's being taught, you
can participate in the discussion, right?"	
Message	Maria	"You have a point. Okay, I can try asking a few
questions."	
Message	Shido	All right, give it a shot.	
Message	Maria	"Teacher, I have a question about the
subject matter."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... O-Okay! Wh-What is it... Arusu-san...?	
Message	Maria	The English earlier seemed to be misused.	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-Wha...?	
Message	Student A	*Whisper, whisper*...	
Message	Student B	I wonder if that Arusu-san is really smart.	
Message	Student C	Maybe she's an international student?	
Message	Tonomachi	"A harsh comment toward Yoshino-sensei...! Woo,
Arusu-chan is so cool!"	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... I taught it exactly the way it was in the
book."	
Message	Shido	Maria... That's not good!	
Message	None	(I signaled an "X" to her and told her to stop.)	
Message	Maria	Shido, was there a problem with my question?	
Message	Shido	"Oh uh... I think it was too harsh of a question...
Maybe you shouldn't point out any errors in the
course material?"	
Message	Maria	Understood... I will improve.	
Message	Maria	"I'm sorry, sensei. I mean to say, why don't you
try changing the material you are using? This one
is an older version compared to the international—"	
Message	Shido	—Maria!	
Message	Maria	"I thought we could resolve the issue this way...
Is that an issue?"	
Message	Shido	"You can't just change the school materials so
easily... Look, Yoshino is about to cry."	
Message	Maria	"I can't speak the truth... Class is very
difficult."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's hard to explain, but... it's not right.
Anyways, sorry, that was my fault for suggesting
it. Give me some time."	
Message	Maria	Understood.	
Message	None	"(I signaled Yoshino to continue on with the class.
Yoshino just became a teacher, so I feel bad for
starting all this.)"	
Message	None	"(This is going to be hard. How can I have Maria
participate in the classroom?)"	
Message	None	"(I know... Maybe I can ask someone for ideas. Who
should I ask?)"	
Choice		Ask Tohka to help.	
Choice		Ask Origami for help.	
Choice		Consult with Kurumi.	
Choice		Ask for Yoshino's cooperation.	
Message	Shido	Maybe I can ask Tohka.	
Message	Shido	Tohka, can I ask you something?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"It's Maria. It seems like she's having trouble
asking the right questions during class. Do you
have any good ideas?"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, really? She certainly flaunted some impressive
knowledge earlier."	
Message	Shido	No, I mean something more normal.	
Message	Tohka	"I see. I don't know too many things, though...
I've never had difficulty in asking questions."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see... I guess it's a completely different
case, huh?"	
Message	Tohka	"But as it is you making the request, I will share
with Arusu my best question."	
Message	Shido	"Oh! Thanks, Tohka!
...Maria, Tohka's calling you."	
Message	Maria	What is it?	
Message	Tohka	"Well Arusu, I think this would be the perfect
question to ask."	
Message	Maria	"The answer to that question is written on the next
page."	
Message	Tohka	"What...? Ohh, so this is the answer?! How did you
come to that conclusion?"	
Message	Maria	Well, if you look at the text here...	
Message	None	(Uh, this is...)	
Message	Tohka	"Oops. In the end, I couldn't do anything to help,
and class is already over. Sorry, Shido."	
Message	Shido	No, it's fine. I'm glad I asked you, Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What? Really? But she was the one teaching me
everything."	
Message	Shido	"Well, when she was teaching you earlier, she
looked like she was having a little fun."	
Message	None	"(No matter how hard I think, I usually fail, but
Tohka's instincts are usually spot on.)"	
Message	Shido	That's what makes you amazing, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Me, amazing? What are you talking about?	
Message	None	(This is also going to take some explaining...)	
Message	Maria	"Shido and Tohka... Thank you for earlier. Because
of you two, I was able to gain more insight into
what a class should be.)"	
Message	Shido	See? Maria's thanking you, too.	
Message	Tohka	H-Hm, I suppose so... Then, no need to thank me.	
Message	Maria	"Okay. Shido, there was something I was curious
about, so I'm going to leave the classroom for a
little while."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Later.	
Message	Maria	Okay. Thank you. Well, then...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, crap. It's already time for the next class,
huh? Sorry, Tohka, I'm going to head out."	
Message	Tohka	"Okay, understood. I'll explain to the
next teacher!"	
Message	Shido	Thanks!	
Message	Shido	Origami, I need to ask you something.	
Message	Origami	"Got it. I will prepare immediately.
Give me a moment."	
Message	Shido	...What?	
Message	None	"(What is she preparing for? Just as I was
wondering, Origami put her hand up her skirt...
Whoa?!)"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait, Origami?! Why are you trying to take your
clothes off?!"	
Message	Origami	...You said you wanted to ask me something.	
Message	Shido	"But how does that end up with you taking your
underwear off?!"	
Message	Origami	You don't want it?	
Message	Shido	No, I don't!	
Message	Origami	...I see.	
Message	Origami	So what is it, then?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I wanted Maria to participate in class more. I
was wondering if you had any good questions she
could ask."	
Message	Origami	Questions?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Do you have any ideas?	
Message	Origami	"I see. She should ask things that the Hermit can
answer."	
Message	Shido	You mean Yoshino?	
Message	Origami	"She asks, the opponent answers. That's what you
want her to experience, right? Then the type of
question should allow for that exchange."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see. So you're saying I shouldn't think too
hard about it. Thanks, Origami!"	
Message	None	"(Just as Origami suggested, I gave Maria topics
that Yoshino could discuss. In other words, within
the range of information in the textbook.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, it seemed like Maria already knew the
answer without having to ask, but she seems to be
understanding the benefits of asking questions.)"	
Message	Shido	I think she was able to get the feel of it...	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Oh, Origami. Thanks for earlier.	
Message	Origami	No problem. I always welcome your requests.	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. But maybe I was out of line to suggest it.	
Message	Origami	"Maria Arusu is very intelligent, but she lacks the
experience to adequately employ her knowledge. I
think it's good that she gets the gist of things."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Origami.	
Message	Maria	Shido, I need to talk to you.	
Message	Shido	Sure...?	
Message	Maria	"There's something I'm curious about, so I'm going
to leave the classroom for a little bit."	
Message	Shido	Hey, where are you going? Sorry, Origami... Later!	
Message	Origami	...You're welcome.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, can I ask you something?	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, it's very nice that you're consulting me for
advice, Shido-san. Is it about Arusu-san?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You see, I want her to participate in class
to get a better idea of what it really feels like."	
Message	Shido	"Do you know of any good ways for her to do so,
Kurumi?"	
Message	Kurumi	I don't believe you need to think too hard on it.	
Message	Shido	Any ideas?	
Message	Kurumi	"I think that Arusu-san is asking questions at her
specific intelligence level. She should stop
doing that."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Kurumi	"Rather than use the knowledge with which she's
been gifted, she should only utilize information
from sources she's personally observed."	
Message	Shido	"I see. So basically she's not allowed to search
the system. Thanks. I'll let her know."	
Message	Kurumi	Okay, I wish you the best of luck.	
Message	Shido	Thanks.	
Message	None	"(All right, I'm going to tell Maria what Kurumi
told me.)"	
Message	Shido	Maria, come here.	
Message	Maria	What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Let me ask you something. How did you look up the
question you asked Yoshino?"	
Message	Maria	I searched the system database.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I figured. So let's refrain from doing that.
Why don't you try investigating on your own?"	
Message	Maria	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"You see, the point of class is to think on your
own. You may think it may not be effective, but
why don't you give it a shot?"	
Message	Maria	...Understood. I will try doing as you suggested.	
Message	None	(I'm so glad, she seems to want to do it.)	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kurumi. I think she'll figure it out.	
Message	Kurumi	"You're welcome, Shido-san. I'm glad I was of help
to you."	
Message	None	"(In the end, Arusu couldn't think of a question
for class. I guess Arusu was already really smart
even without being able to search her database...)"	
Message	None	"(But it was the first time I saw her use a
dictionary, and she seemed to be having fun.)"	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	"I haven't done anything worth thanking. Anyways...
Shido-san, you're kind to everyone, aren't you?"	
Message	Kurumi	I'm getting kind of jealous.	
Message	Shido	Don't make me blush.	
Message	Kurumi	And why not? Oh... Isn't that Arusu-san?	
Message	Maria	Shido, do you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Oh, what's up?	
Message	Maria	"I'm curious about something, so I'm going to leave
the classroom for a little while."	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it... Later.	
Message	Maria	Okay, thank you. 	
Message	Shido	"...Hey, wait! The next class is about to begin.
Oh... She's gone."	
Message	Kurumi	Shouldn't you go find her?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Sorry, Kurumi, but for the next class...	
Message	Kurumi	"...I'll let the teacher know that you went to the
infirmary with Arusu-san."	
Message	Shido	Thanks! Later...!	
Message	Kurumi	But it's not good to be nice to everyone.	
Message	None	"(After thinking about it, I asked Yoshino to help
me. While everyone else was translating a long
English sentence, I decided to plot with Yoshino.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino! I mean, Yoshino-sensei!
I have a question..."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, I'll be right over...!	
Message	None	"(All right. She seemed to have understood my
intention. Yoshino came running over.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry about earlier. So I have a favor to ask you.	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... What is it?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, hey, Shido-kuuun. This time, please refrain\nfrom a killer pass where you smack the receiver's\nface with a hunk of dirt."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry about that. I thought it through this time.
For the next translation, can you call on Maria?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh. Arusu-san...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, if the answer is already set, there's no way
an issue would arise, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	I see... Okay...	
Message	Yoshinon	"You sure thought that one through, Shido-kun!\nGosh, you're so cunning!"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha, it's not that big of a deal. Anyways, I'll
let Maria know."	
Message	Yoshino	Okay.	
Message	Shido	"All right, all that's left is Maria...
Maria, you have a moment?"	
Message	Maria	Shido... is this about earlier?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. This one's a long sentence. Why don't you
try answering it?"	
Message	Maria	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, good, good. Ah... Don't search for answers
though, okay?"	
Message	Maria	...What do you mean by that?	
Message	Shido	If you do that, it's basically cheating, isn't it?	
Message	Maria	You have a point. I'll... give it a shot.	
Message	None	"(After hearing me out, Maria seemed to understand.
Though she stumbled a bit, she was eventually able
to translate the sentence.)"	
Message	Shido	Thanks for earlier, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san... Anything for you...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, you forgot about Yoshinon,\ndidn't you?"	
Message	Shido	Ah, Yoshinon. Thank you, too.	
Message	Maria	Shido, I need to talk to you.	
Message	Shido	Sure. What is it, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"I'm curious about something, so I'm going to leave
the classroom for a little while."	
Message	Shido	All right. See you.	
Message	Maria	Okay, thank you. Well, then...	
Message	Yoshino	I-I wonder what happened.	
Message	Shido	Beats me.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun. Should you really hang around like\nthat? The next class is about to start. Is it okay\nto leave her alone?"	
Message	Shido	Oh! You're right. I need to go find her.	
Message	Yoshino	O-Oh... Shido-san...!	
Message	Shido	What is it, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	G-Good luck...!	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Yoshino. Well then... Later.
