Message	None	"(It seems like everyone has finished cooking. A
variety of dishes have been laid out across the
table.)"	
Message	Shido	I don't know if I can eat them all.	
Message	Kotori	"Well, can't help it. There's seven people's worth
of food here."	
Message	Shido	"Well, among them are some questionable dishes that
I'm not sure I can eat."	
Message	Tohka	Hey, who made such a thing?!	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, I'm sorry but you're the main offender! I
mean, only the outside is cooked... The inside
is pretty much raw."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm... But I cooked it on the barbecue...	
Message	Shido	"It was way bigger than the barbecue... Well, I
guess I can eat the outside part that's cooked."	
Message	Origami	"Honestly, it's not something you can eat. Tohka
Yatogami's dish has been disqualified on the
grounds of unsafe consumption."	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What are you talking about?! How about you,
Origami Tobiichi?!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh, Origami... Is it this black, tar-looking
thing?"	
Message	Origami	They're stewed vegetables. Black sesame sauce.	
Message	Shido	So this is black sesame sauce, huh...	
Message	Origami	"The dish has been adjusted perfectly for caloric
content. This should make you feel energetic."	
Message	Shido	"I'm going to ask just in case... but did you put
in too many things you shouldn't have, and
then tried to cover it up by making it black?"	
Message	Origami	Open sesame.	
Message	Shido	"Not now! I can also smell the sweet chemical smell
of an energy drink! It's clearly dangerous!"	
Message	Origami	Don't worry. It'll give you sexual power.	
Message	Shido	"Listen to me... A meal refers to something like
stewed meat and potatoes. And this..."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-It... was me... S-Sorry... I burnt
it a little..."	
Message	Shido	This is totally fine.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino made it with love. You'd better enjoy it,\nShido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I sure will.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my... My cooking is totally standing out. It
wasn't much of a battle, so I feel surprised."	
Message	Shido	"So this pot-au-feu is your dish, Kurumi? You're
right, it looks delicious. And this smell... did
you use wine as an ingredient?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Wow, you noticed. Amazing, Shido-san. You're so
clever, I can feel myself falling for you."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	"But unfortunately, that doesn't mean that he'll
like it. I know Shido's preferences better than
anyone."	
Message	Kurumi	"You sure seem confident, Flame Spirit-san. So what
did you make?"	
Message	Kotori	Hehe... This!	
Message	Shido	"Toast, eggs sunny-side up, salad...
Uh, this is breakfast."	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What...? You always eat it.	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... I mean in the morning, it's easy to make
when I don't have much time. So we do eat it
a lot."	
Message	Kaguya	"Bwahaha. You guys are nothing! Yuzuru and I put
our souls into our dish. This Master Plan
is second to none."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confidence. When Kaguya and Yuzuru cooperate,
there is nothing to be afraid of."	
Message	Shido	"The Yamais made omelettes, just as they said they
would."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Side dish. We also made consommé and burdock root
salad."	
Message	Tohka	"Wait, Yuzuru! I thought the battle was based off
of one dish!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. Although the battle may be one dish,
there were no rules about providing side dishes."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What?!	
Message	Kotori	"Yuzuru is right. We never set any rules against
making sides. However, it's not counted in
the judgement."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... That's fine. This is just the result of
our thinking about our servant... It's no
big deal."	
Message	Kaguya	"Rather, I feel like I made something dangerous.
The cooking goddess smiled upon us. This amazing
dish will be talked about for thousands of years."	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya, you're always exaggerating... But it does
look really delicious. Aside from the main dish,
you also put together some sides, so it seems great."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confession. The key ingredient of this dish's
overall taste is the onion that Kaguya cut as
she cried."	
Message	Kaguya	"Y-You don't have to tell him about the
crying part!"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha, I look forward to it. And compared to
that, this final dish... I wish I never saw it."	
Message	Miku	"What are you talking about, darling? This is curry
made with lots of love."	
Message	Shido	"Curry... It did smell similar, but I refuse to
call this curry..."	
Message	Miku	Doesn't it smell delicious?	
Message	Shido	The smell, yeah... but the color. What is it?	
Message	Miku	"I asked for everyone's opinions over the phone and
put them all in."	
Message	Shido	"Although it does smell like curry, I just can't
take it..."	
Message	Miku	"It'll be fine～ I'll feed you, so just open your
mouth, darling."	
Message	Origami	Shido. Then, I too will feed you. Eat mine first.	
Message	Shido	Whoa... Hold on, you guys.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe, be happy, Shido...! I will personally offer
you this honorable meal."	
Message	Yuzuru	Open mouth. Please eat Yuzuru's as well.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, Shido-san? Of course you're going to eat mine
as well, aren't you?"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Mine too! Meat, eat the meat!	
Message	Shido	"I can't eat them all at once! Tohka, I can only
eat the outside of yours. Stop it, you guys!
Order! I'll eat them in order!"	
Message	Kotori	Hey, don't forget mine. I did make it, you know.	
Message	Yoshino	Au... um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino, now's your chance. You can feed\nShido-kun with your mouth."	
Message	Shido	"You guys... Hng... You guys can... Ngh...
Calm down... Gah... and let me eat... Bahh...!"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, I knew this would happen.	
Message	Arusu	...
