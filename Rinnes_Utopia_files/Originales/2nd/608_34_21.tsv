Message	Shido	Okay, let's line up for the roller coaster.	
Message	Maria	"The line is so long. I suppose this means it
is a popular ride?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I guess so. Roller coasters are almost
always popular."	
Message	Kotori	Ooh. I'm excited!	
Message	Yoshino	My heart... is thumping.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Are you okay, Yoshino? It's really tall,\nand really fast."	
Message	Shido	You okay, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... I am fine.	
Message	Shido	"Still, the line goes on forever. I can't even
tell where the end is. How long are we gonna
have to wait?"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, over there. There's a sign pointing to the
end of the line."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confirmation. It is an estimated sixty minutes
from the end of the line to the front."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, thanks you two. I see. Sixty minutes, huh?
Wait, isn't than an hour wait?!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Surprise. You could view an entire short film.	
Message	Kotori	"What should we do, Onii-chan? Should we give
it up for today?"	
Message	Shido	"No, we're here and everything. If we can't
wait an hour, what can we do!"	
Message	Kotori	Yeeeeah!	
Message	Shido	"For now, let's get in line. It'll be a long wait,
so brace yourselves for the challenge, everyone."	
Message	Shido	Still, waiting in line is such a bore.	
Message	None	"(Looking around, I see people poking at their
phones or pulling out game consoles. One hour
is no joke.)"	
Message	None	"(They say that couples should avoid amusement
parks typically because of the painful waits.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Maria. What are you up to? Find
anything interesting?"	
Message	Maria	"Human observation... Is that what you would call
it?"	
Message	Shido	Human observation?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Age, gender, numbers within a group.
It is extremely interesting to observe all of
their behaviors."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see. I see what you mean.	
Message	Maria	"Each and every person who comes to this
park comes from a different walk of life."	
Message	Shido	"Even the ways parents interact with their
children vary. The notion entertains me."	
Message	None	"(It's crazy to think everyone besides us is
an NPC.)"	
Message	Maria	"The group over there have been drawing
sticks."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. They're deciding the order of who should
sit where on the roller coaster. That way, you
can sit by someone you're interested in."	
Message	Maria	"The family over there appears to be peering
into something."	
Message	Shido	"It looks like a digital camera. They might be
checking out the pictures they've taken. It
seems everyone is making the most of waiting."	
Message	Maria	Yes. How intriguing.	
Message	Shido	Maybe I'll look around a bit more too.	
Message	None	"(I was thinking about how bored I was
earlier, but if I'm waiting, I might as well
enjoy myself.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Return. Apologies, Shido. I am back.	
Message	Shido	Huh? When did you leave...?	
Message	Origami	"We left the line momentarily to purchase
some refreshments."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Supply. An hour is long after all. I anticipated
us to go hungry."	
Message	Shido	I see. Thanks, you two.	
Message	Kotori	They're done, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	"Oooh. I noticed you were quiet. What have
you been up to?"	
Message	Kotori	"Heh heh heh. We heard what you two were
talking about, so Yoshino and I tried making
sticks. Now we can choose how to pair up."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I think we made them well...	
Message	Shido	Oh, then let's try using them.	
Message	Origami	"It's no problem. Even if I leave it to chance,
I will be the one to sit beside Shido. It is
decided."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Challenge. It will not go that way, Lady
Origami. I am the one in control of the fate."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I won't lose either...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Best of luck, Yoshino! Yeeeeah!"	
Message	Kotori	Ah ha ha. Do your best, everyone!	
Message	Shido	"Wait, Kotori. You just hid something, didn't
you? Show it to me."	
Message	Kotori	Eeep. I didn't hide anything, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	"It's obvious you're holding something in
your left hand... Hey, that's the longest stick.
What an obvious trick."	
Message	Kotori	"Th-This is, um... You know, just in case we
lose a stick..."	
Message	Maria	"Kotori, since you went through the trouble
of crafting the sticks, perhaps it is best
for them to be used fairly."	
Message	Kotori	Hm. You're right. I'm sorry.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Everyone pull one.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confirmation. Then, if everyone approves,
I will give the signal on two. One, two!"	
Message	Shido	Excuse me, how about counting to six?	
Message	Official	Okay. Right this way. Have a great time!	
Message	None	(Well, the order we ended up in was...)	
Message	Origami	"It was the fate of the sticks. It cannot be
helped."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Sigh. Lady Origami, it is already over. Try
to enjoy yourself regardless."	
Message	Origami	All right, then.	
Message	Kotori	W-Well, guess that's how it goes.	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Kotori... We can still have fun.	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, Kotori was wearing her
black ribbons. Is she scared of the ride?
She loves acting tough, so it's possible.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, that is where we go, yes?	
Message	Shido	Yup. That's right.	
Message	Maria	I feel slightly nervous for some reason.	
Message	Shido	"It'll be fine. It's the two of us again, huh
Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It is a shame that I am not sitting
beside you, Shido. It would be more fun
that way."	
Message	Shido	S-Sure... Thanks.	
Message	None	"(This roller coaster has a unique design,
with one person sitting in front, and three
in the back. I got the frontmost seat."	
Message	None	"(We took our seats, and the ride began to
accelerate slowly.)"	
Message	Maria	"This coaster. Is it not moving slower than
how it looked in line?"	
Message	Shido	"Roller coasters don't start at that speed.
Um. It'd be better for you to experience it
than for me to explain. Here. It'll speed up."	
Message	Maria	Understood. So it increases in speed over time.	
Message	Shido	"I mean, not exactly. All right, Maria.
You ready?"	
Message	Maria	Ready?	
Message	Shido	Yup, that's right. We're about to go down!	
Message	Maria	Go down...? What do you mean by—	
Message	None	"(Maria was interrupted as the cart dropped
down the steep slope. We traveled at high
speed, as if we were flung into the air.)"	
Message	None	(But are the drops normally this long?!)	
Message	Shido	――――――――!!	
Message	None	(This is surprisingly intense!)	
Message	Kotori	O-Ooogh...	
Message	Yoshino	K-Kotori-san...	
Message	Origami	We are going several G's in speed...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. If I open my mouth too much,
I may bite my tongue."	
Message	None	(Everyone seems to be doing okay.)	
Message	Maria	Should I let out a scream at this time?	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Maria	Then, kyaaaaaaa!!	
Message	Maria	Kyaaaaaaaaa!!	
Message	Shido	M-Maria!	
Message	None	"(Maria's exhilarating yell released all of the
tension in my body. Okay, my turn!)"	
Message	Shido	Whooooooah!!!	
Message	Maria	This is so exciting!	
Message	Shido	Yeah!	
Message	Maria	Kyaaaaaah!!	
Message	Kotori	IYAAAAAH!	
Message	Yoshino	A-AAAAH! Hyaaaa!	
Message	Origami	...! Kyaa.	
Message	Yuzuru	Kyaaaaaaa!	
Message	Shido	Aaaaaaaaahh!!	
Message	None	"(I realized soon that everyone was screaming,
though I couldn't tell if it was from fear or
joy.)"	
Message	None	"(The thrill comes from the rise and fall of
the cart. No wonder people are so addicted
to roller coasters.)"	
Message	None	"(Man, my legs feel so wobbly. It might be my
imagination, but it seems like my back is giving
out too. Maybe that first drop WAS too long.)"	
Message	Maria	Hee hee. It was fun, wasn't it?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, sure was. Haven't had a rush like that
in a while."	
Message	None	"(For someone having just survived that screaming
metal death trap, I can't stop smiling. As if my
face is stretched out. Is it the excitement?)"	
Message	Maria	"It was a lovely experience. A place where I
can scream without reservation. Different
than karaoke. It was entirely new to me."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you're right.	
Message	Kotori	"(Once we got off the ride, Kotori had
changed into her white ribbons. Busy
girl.)"	
Message	None	"(Once we got off the ride, Kotori had
changed into her white ribbons. Busy
girl.)"	
Message	Maria	What do you mean, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	I mean, that. Over there.	
Message	Shido	Oh, right. The photo.	
Message	Yoshinon	"They snap the photo while you're riding\nthe coaster, all secret-like!"	
Message	Shido	Err. I wouldn't put it like that...	
Message	Maria	I see. I am curious.	
Message	Shido	All right. Then let's take a look.	
Message	Maria	Yes!	
Message	Shido	Haha. Our faces are totally stretched out.	
Message	Maria	Yes, it is a wonderful picture.	
Message	Shido	"Totally. You seem to be having fun, Maria.
Want to buy this as a souvenir?"	
Message	Maria	Is that okay?	
Message	Shido	Yes, of course.	
Message	Origami	Then, please purchase one for me too.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Petition. Shido, I wish to procure one as well.
A souvenir of today would be exquisite."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san, me too..	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't forget Yoshino and me, okay, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	"All right. Got it. You're fine with mine,
right, Kotori? I'll buy five."	
Message	Shido	Here, Maria. Don't lose it, okay?	
Message	Maria	...Yes. I will take good care of it.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	"(The wait for the roller coaster was long,
but I'm glad Maria had a good time. I'm
sure this photo will be a nice memento.)"	
Message	Shido	"It would've been great to get a copy for
myself."	
Message	Maria	...Did you say something, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"No, nothing. Want to take a break, or do
you want to see another attraction?"	
Message	Maria	"This attraction took up a lot of our time,
so why don't we see another?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. You're right.	
Message	None	"(And so, we saw the rest of the park long
until after the sun had set.)"
