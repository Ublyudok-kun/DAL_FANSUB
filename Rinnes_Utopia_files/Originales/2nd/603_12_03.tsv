Message	None	(Tonomachi invited me out after school.)	
Message	Shido	So, where are you taking me?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, come on... What's the rush? You're
going to have a great time, Itsuka."	
Message	None	(He wouldn't tell me.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"Lately, you've become real popular, so
it's hard to have some of you for myself!"	
Message	Shido	What, so now you're punishing me for it?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"HAHAHA! Well, all that aside, it's been a
while since we've had a day as just us boys,
so let's have some bro time."	
Message	Shido	What happens if I don't put it aside...?	
Message	Tonomachi	Well―	
Message	None	(Just as Tonomachi was about to respond.)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, hey, Shido-kuuuun. How are ya?\nYou're done with class, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	H-Hello...	
Message	Shido	Yeah. We just finished. What's up, you two?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um. We were.. waiting for you, Shido-san.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah. Yoshino kept saying she wanted to\nsee you. I'm almost worried because she said\nshe doesn't even care if there are strangers!"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm fine. I'm happy I ran into you.	
Message	Shido	I-I see.	
Message	Tonomachi	Itsuka?	
Message	None	"(I felt an aura piercing me from behind, and
I spun around to see Tonomachi glaring at me.)"	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi, take it easy. Just listen―	
Message	Tonomachi	"Shut up! Forget about you, Itsuka! I'd rather
get kicked by a horse than stick around here.
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh. Did we interrupt something? Good grief.\nSorry, Shido-kun."	
Choice		Yes, you did.	
Choice		It's okay.	
Message	Shido	"It's been a while since I hung out with
Tonomachi."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry for getting in the way.	
Message	None	"(Oh, crap. I'm basically implying that they
were a nuisance.)"	
Message	Yoshino	"I should have thought it through. You have
your own life..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"No guy likes girls who nag. At least that's\nwhat my sources tell me."	
Message	Yoshino	*whimper*...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry. I never meant to make you think
that you were bothering me."	
Message	None	"(I kinda feel bad for Tonomachi, too.
I'll call him later and apologize.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, don't tell me Tonomachi-kun\nis more important than Yoshino to you."	
Message	Yoshino	...What?!	
Message	Shido	"NO NO! Of course not! It's more like I haven't
been able to spend time with Tonomachi lately.""	
Message	Yoshinon	"So it's true..."	
Message	Yoshino	You are...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, don't put words in my mouth!	
Message	None	"(Hanging out with Tonomachi even for
five minutes invites a load of trouble.)"	
Message	Shido	No, I think we're fine.	
Message	Yoshino	Are you sure...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. So anyways, what can I do for you?	
Message	Yoshino	"Is it wrong of me to want to see you...?
Even if I have no particular reason?"	
Message	Shido	Not at all...	
Message	Yoshino	I'm so glad...	
Message	Yoshinon	"With that said, I pity the guy who ran off\nand all, but how about the three of us find\nsomething fun to do?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sure. You waited for me after all.	
Message	None	"(Guess I'll have to call up Tonomachi and
apologize later. Nah, no need.)"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, did you have somewhere in mind,
Yoshino? We could watch a movie or maybe
stop by the video store."	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, um... I could just ask... and movies will
be provided for me."	
Message	Yoshinon	"They're so generous. Talk about having friends\nin your corner!"	
Message	Shido	"Well, if Ratatoskr can build you a whole
apartment, sending you some movies isn't
a problem."	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, we don't need to waste time standing
here. Let's go."	
Message	None	"(I'm sure they waited for me all day, so
I bet they're tired.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um... I'll leave it to you.	
Message	Yoshinon	"I think it'd be best to go somewhere where\nyou can relax."	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	None	"(I decided to take Yoshino to a restaurant
that Kotori and I had been to before.)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um. Do you come here often... Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Hm? I mean, sometimes...	
Message	Yoshinon	"But you wouldn't come here alone, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I take Kotori here sometimes. Come
to think of it, I never come here alone."	
Message	Yoshinon	"I see. Guess they don't call it a family\nrestaurant for nothing."	
Message	Shido	Well, when I'm by myself. I eat random junk.	
Message	Yoshino	I see...	
Message	Yoshinon	"But there's an implication when you call it\na 'family' restaurant, don't you think?"	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't think you should bring your 'family'\nto a 'family restaurant'?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Wh-Whaaaa? Yoshino, then that would
mean... Shido-san and I..."	
Message	Shido	"Ahahaha. Well, um, I think it just means
a cozy atmosphere."	
Message	Yoshino	A-And... Kotori-san is...	
Message	Shido	Kotori's my little sister, so she is family.	
Message	Yoshinon	"I mean, sure. But doesn't the thought\ncross your mind whenever you bring\ngirls here?"	
Message	Shido	"About that.... Family restaurants aren't exactly
a romantic getaway."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, no? So you're admitting you didn't\ngo all out for Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, it doesn't bother me...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, we just came here to eat.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. I'm just teasing you."	
Message	Shido	"Some time soon, I want to take you to a fancier
place, but..."	
Message	Yoshino	"But...? Oh, um, I'm sorry. It's hard to go there
because of me, isn't it..."	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not what I mean. I just don't really
go on fancy dates, you know?"	
Message	Yoshino	R-Really?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whaaat? You're always surrounded by\nwomen. Don't tell me you can't think of\none place."	
Message	Shido	This is all a misunderstanding!	
Message	None	"(Besides, it's not my fault I've never been
on a fancy date.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Hehehe... Shido-san, is that true?	
Message	Shido	"Yup. Just another reason I'll nothing more
than a headache..."	
Message	Yoshino	I want to... experience new things with you.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	(My and Yoshino's eyes locked.)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Woohoo! You guys make me jealous.\nWhat cuties."	
Message	Shido	"S-Stop mocking us. A-Anyways, what are
you going to order?"	
Message	Yoshino	U-um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, any recommendations?"	
Message	Shido	"Hm. They're doing a dessert fair, so how
about this parfait?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmm. A seasonal fruit fair, huh? Sounds\ndelicious. Want this one, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um... Uh, what about you, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	I... Hm. I'm fine with fruit juice.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Then you can ask Yoshino for a bite of\nher parfait. Have her feed you. Whaddya say?"	
Message	Shido	...I'm okay, but thanks.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh. Come on. If you ordered a parfait too,\nthen you can't use the same spoon?"	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Yoshino	Um. Could I request some coffee?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh, sorry. Were you not into the
parfait?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, no. I'm sorry... I just wanted some coffee.	
Message	Shido	You're not sick, are you?	
Message	Yoshinon	"I don't think so. I think she's trying to\nbe more mature."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon, um... Please don't...	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Oh, well. If you want coffee, that's fine.
I get it. Sometimes you just crave it."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... I want some... coffee...	
Message	Yoshinon	"But you used to say how you disliked it\nbecause it was so bitter. I think you're\ntrying too hard, Yoshinoooooo."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yoshinon!	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. Maybe you have a point. Yoshino
does enjoy sweets..."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I, too, enjoy coffee... I can handle bitter
things."	
Message	Shido	"When I was younger, I never got why people
drank the stuff. But before I knew it, I was
hooked."	
Message	Yoshino	R-Right. Coffee is... delicious.	
Message	None	"(It felt like something was off, but I called
our waitress over to take our order.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, are you sure you don't want milk
or sugar?"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I don't need it.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, look at you. It's pretty bitter. Maybe\neven a little sour. Adding milk might make\nit more bearable."	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon, Yoshino said she would drink it.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hahahaha. Okay, okay. But don't tell you I\ndidn't warn you if you hate it. Right Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. Well, I don't think you have to force
yourself. Drink it whichever way you want."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, how... do you like your coffee?	
Message	Shido	"Well, if I'm sleepy, I take it black.
But I also like a good café au lait, too."	
Message	Yoshino	So you don't always drink it black?	
Message	Shido	Well, I can only handle so much bitterness.	
Message	Yoshinon	"HAHAHAHA! Shido-kun, I wish you could\nbe a real man and say you liked it bla―"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. I guess drinking it black is a true
sign of maturity, huh?"	
Message	Yoshino	M-Maturity, yes.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino sipped her coffee, but I saw a
hint of reservation. I couldn't help from
looking at her.)"	
Message	None	"(To make matters worse, her other hand held
Yoshinon, making her shake even more.)"	
Message	Yoshino	...HOT!	
Message	Shido	A-Are you okay?	
Message	None	"(Yoshino was shocked by the temperature,
causing her hand to slip.)"	
Message	None	"(I hastily reached for a napkin to wipe
the spilled coffee.)"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Oh, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, you okay?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, I'm fine...	
Message	Shido	No, you're not. You need to be careful.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Looks like you didn't get any on your\nclothes, but there's coffee on your legs."	
Message	None	"(I looked at Yoshino's thigh, and threw
some napkins there.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, this is―	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, no no. You were trying to help Yoshino,\nright? I know it wasn't a lewd act. Shido-kun,\nyou're seriously such a―"	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you on about?! Oh, your
skin is a little pink."	
Message	Yoshino	I-It... stings a bit...	
Message	Shido	Maybe some ice would help...	
Message	None	"(I wiped the spilled coffee, but now the
napkin was soaked.)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, Shido-san... I'm fine.	
Message	Shido	"You shouldn't take burns lightly. Hang
on a moment."	
Message	None	"(I scooped some ice out of the water and
put in on Yoshino's reddened thigh.)"	
Message	Yoshino	"Aah... O-Ooh... Shido-san... Th-That... Mm...
Aah... Faaaah!"	
Message	Shido	"It might become a burn later, so bear with me
for a bit."	
Message	Yoshino	B-But... That's cold... Ah... Fa...mm...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido, quick thinking. Yoshino, just grin and\nbear it. Otherwise it'll leave a scar."	
Message	Yoshino	"Okay... I-I'll endure it... Mmmf... Hah...
*grunt*... Aah... *pant*... Mm..."	
Message	Shido	Sorry. Just hang in there for me.	
Message	Yoshinon	"You're apologizing, but am I hearing a\ntouch of satisfaction from you hearing Yoshino\nmoan like this?"	
Message	Shido	"U-Um, Yoshinon. This isn't the time for that.
Yoshino, does it still hurt?"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, it tickles... I can't tell anymore...	
Message	Shido	If you're fine, then I'm fine.	
Message	None	"(I took off the ice cube, and a sense of relief
came over Yoshino. I used a napkin to dry
her skin.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Fua... U-Um, Shido-san...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, your clothes might get wet. We need
to wipe the moisture."	
Message	Yoshinon	"You say that, but it's a slippery slope. I get\nit though. You're taking advantage of the\nsituation for a little contact, right?"	
Message	Shido	Hey, I told you. That's not what's going on―	
Message	Yoshinon	"Mmm? You don't want to hurt Yoshino's\nfeelings, do you?"	
Message	Shido	That's not what I'm saying either! 	
Message	Yoshino	"Th-Then, if we're not in front of people...
You would...?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, um... I'm sorry. It's nothing.	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Gotcha.	
Message	Yoshinon	"But Yoshino, drinking coffee black for the\nfirst time led to Shido-kun patting your leg\ndry."	
Message	Shido	"Forget what Yoshinon's saying. Anyways,
why did you order coffee, Yoshino? I thought
it's what you wanted."	
Message	Yoshino	"W-Well, I thought, it would be a mature
choice..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, is that why?	
Message	Yoshino	Don't... tease me for my reason.	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I just mean you shouldn't have to force
yourself to do anything. Adults can eat parfaits,
can't they?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah, totally. You can be tough and enjoy\nsweet things at the same time. Gosh..."	
Message	Yoshino	...Right.	
Message	Shido	"Don't force yourself. You're entitled to eat
whatever you want."	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, but...! Sh-Shido-san, are you okay with
that?"	
Message	Shido	Of course! It's not like I'm your boss.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino pursed her lips, suddenly deep in
thought.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked at Yoshino, but the puppet only
smiled back at me, silent for once in her
life.)"
