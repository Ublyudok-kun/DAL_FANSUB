Message	Shido	I wonder what love is...	
Message	Kaguya	"Why the long face, Shido? You have been blessed
with the presence of the Yamai Sisters."	
Message	Shido	"No, I know, but... I need to tell Arusu what love
is or we can't get out of this world, right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. We have just begun here. I think it's
too soon to stress about it."	
Message	Shido	"Well, you have a point. But come to think of it,
isn't what you two have love? Would you guys be
able to give me any hints?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Yuzuru does love Kaguya, but I believe
it is different from the love between a man and
woman."	
Message	Kaguya	"We are one in body and soul. Consider our
relationship to be a diamond that all others seek.
Only we can look upon the world from so high."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analyzing. She seems to want to express that both
parties can support one another. Perhaps such a
relationship exists between a man and a woman."	
Message	Shido	"That's right... But, it seems like there's
more to it..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Challenging question. Yuzuru does not know.	
Message	Kaguya	"Anyways, Yuzuru. We should join Tohka and Origami
in that horrific pastime of theirs."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. You mean cards. Let's show them what we
are made of."	
Message	None	"(At this rate, I don't think we'll be able
to sleep.)"
