Message	Kusakabe	Oh? If it isn't Itsuka-kun.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kusakabe-san.	
Message	Kusakabe	"It's perfect timing. I needed some male
assistance. Do you have time right now?"	
Message	Shido	Erm. I guess. What is it?	
Message	Kusakabe	It's this. Here.	
Message	Shido	It's... a car.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Yeah. It's illegally parked. I called the police,
but it's blocking traffic, right? I thought I'd get it
out of the way."	
Message	Shido	"Out of the way... The car? By ourselves?
That might be impossible..."	
Message	Kusakabe	"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Don't underestimate the Ground
Self-Defense Force, young man. Here, grab that side."	
Message	Shido	Er, ah, right.	
Message	Kusakabe	"It'll put some hair on your chest. All right.
One, two!"	
Message	Kusakabe	"Good work. You were a great help. Here, have
a coffee."	
Message	Shido	...Th-Thank you.	
Message	Shido	That was exhausting...	
Message	Kusakabe	"Ha ha ha. You tried your best. As expected of
a young man. Maybe next time put your back
into it more."	
Message	Shido	I-I'll work on it...	
Message	None	"(Not being totally out breath after moving a
car. The Ground Self-Defense Force is amazing.)"	
Message	Shido	Do you always do stuff like this?	
Message	Kusakabe	"Occasionally. I often witness some sort of
trouble."	
Message	Shido	Haha. I see. Sounds like you've had a busy day.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Yeah, it's a bother. But it's as easy as helping
an elderly person cross the street."	
Message	Shido	Is it...?	
Message	Kusakabe	"That's right. You perform acts of kindness often,
don't you Itsuka-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Yes, well... I suppose.	
Message	Kusakabe	"I am part of the Ground Self-Defense Force.
I have to work for the citizens. Even if I'm not
wearing a uniform."	
Message	Shido	That's nice. Kinda cool.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Itsuka-kun... You're quite honest. We need
talent like yours."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Er, that's a little...	
Message	Kusakabe	"Hee hee. I'm joking. My underlings tend to
disobey orders and do as they please."	
Message	Shido	Ahh. That sounds like a handful.	
Message	Kusakabe	On top of that, my boss is weak and unreliable.	
Message	Kusakabe	"I just wish he would know what it's like
out on the field. You know what I mean,
Itsuka-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(Honestly, I have no idea what she means when
she's talking about work.)"	
Message	Kusakabe	"That's why, meeting an honest kid like you who's
also a good listener is refreshing for me.
*sniff*."	
Message	None	"(I'm starting to feel bad for her... Origami,
it sounds like your superior's got it rough.)"
