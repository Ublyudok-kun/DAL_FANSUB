Message	None	(Hm...? Huh? Where am I?)	
Message	Shido	*Yawn*...	
Message	None	"(I'm... at school. Oh right, did I fall asleep
during class?)"	
Message	Origami	Morning.	
Message	Shido	Ah, morning... wait.	
Message	Shido	"It doesn't seem like it's morning. Did school end
already?"	
Message	Origami	"Yeah. Shido, you were asleep during the entire
afternoon class."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really?! Crap, I have no memory of that... Was
I talking in my sleep or anything?"	
Message	Origami	"Unfortunately, no. However, you were sleeping
with a face that looked lazy."	
Message	Shido	"Lazy, huh... Wow, I didn't know that I slept for
that long."	
Message	Origami	To be honest, you looked like a lazy pig.	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Ai	Tobiichi-saaaaan, you have a moment?	
Message	Mai	Tobiichi-san, I have a question too.	
Message	Mii	That's so lame.	
Message	Origami	They're calling me. I'll be going.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	"(I feel like that last girl's statement was
directed towards me...)"	
Message	None	"(But Origami sure is popular. Well, I guess she's
not just a genius, but a super-elite student. It's
only natural.)"	
Message	None	"(Anyways, I guess I'll go home after I stop by the
bathroom.)"	
Message	None	(Phew... I feel better, and now I'm wide awake.)	
Message	None	"(I guess I'll just go home. What should I make for
dinner...?)"	
Message	None	"(Hm...? What's this? I feel something hard on my
back...?)"	
Message	Origami	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?! What's the matter?	
Message	Origami	"""Don't ""what's the matter"" me. Where do you think
you're going?"""	
Message	Shido	"Where? I mean, school's over, right?
Obviously home."	
Message	Origami	"What are you talking about? I wasn't done talking
to you yet."	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about? I don't feel like we
were in the middle of a conversation."	
Message	Origami	"You don't have the right to deny me. Don't turn
around. Just go straight to the classroom."	
Message	Shido	"I can walk by myself, but... uh, Origami? What is
this hard thing pressed against my back...?"	
Message	Origami	"It's best that you don't know. If you did, I'd
have to do something about it."	
Message	Shido	I... I see.	
Message	Origami	"You don't have to be so rigid. It's super painful,
but it doesn't have the power to kill."	
Message	Shido	"It's super painful?! Wouldn't you say that's
torture?!"	
Message	Origami	Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	"That's so creepy... Wh-What are you
going to do...?"	
Message	Origami	"I told you earlier that we're just going to talk.
However, if you're going to resist, it won't end
there."	
Message	Shido	Just out of curiosity... What if I do resist...?	
Message	Origami	I'll make it... painful.	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Th-That's not funny...	
Message	Origami	"And I can also read to the whole school all the
embarrassing poems you wrote during your junior
high days. Just while I'm at it."	
Message	Shido	That's way too intense!	
Message	Origami	"If you don't like that, then I suggest you listen
to me. And you must show me respect and call
me Origami-sama."	
Message	Shido	O-Origami-sama? Why...	
Message	Shido	"AHH! Okay, okay! Orig... Origami-sama! I won't
resist... I promise I won't!"	
Message	Origami	"Yes. You're my submissive slave. Then you know
what to do, right?"	
Message	Shido	I know, I know! Walk! I'll walk, okay?!	
Message	Origami	I know you know, but any suspicious moves...	
Message	Shido	...Ahh...	
Message	Shido	...So what did you want to talk to me about?	
Message	Origami	Might you consider your predicament?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry.	
Message	Origami	I shall proceed. Shido, you slept all afternoon.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Origami	"You looked really lazy. You were clearly thinking
about another woman."	
Message	Shido	W-What? I don't know what you're talking about.	
Message	Origami	"You were flirting with another woman
in your dreams."	
Message	Shido	Um, that's a baseless accusation.	
Message	Origami	It's equivalent to thousands of deaths.	
Message	Shido	You're blowing it out of proportion!	
Message	Origami	"Then, what kind of dream were you having?
Tell me now."	
Message	Shido	Um... I wonder...	
Message	None	"(I tried thinking, but I was fast asleep and can't
remember having any dreams.)"	
Message	Origami	"You can't play dumb like that. According to your
brain waves, I'm sure you were thinking about
a woman."	
Message	Shido	How can you measure that?	
Message	Origami	"Quiet. Don't make any more excuses. You're going
to apologize and beg for forgiveness like the pig
you are... And I suppose I could forgive you."	
Message	Shido	Oh, come on. Now wait just a minute, Origami...	
Message	Origami	What was that tone...?	
Message	Shido	O-Origami-sama...	
Message	Origami	What? There's no point in making excuses.	
Message	Shido	"I'm not making excuses, I just really don't
remember anything..."	
Message	Origami	The lead angel howls into the sky... The adults\njust don't get it... I'm sure the time will\neventually come. But I have faith in love.	
Message	Shido	"AHHHHHHHHH?! I-I'm sorry, I'm very sorry!
Origami-sama, Origami-sama, please stop!"	
Message	Origami	You want to be honest with me now?	
Message	Shido	"I really don't remember, though! I'll do anything,
but please just don't recite my poem with such
a serious face..."	
Message	Origami	"I see... I like your mindset. Then you'd best
prove yourself to me through your actions.
Do you understand?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Y-Yes... Uh...	
Message	Origami	"Your head is too high in front of your master.
You are a mere slave."	
Message	Shido	M-Master...?	
Message	Origami	"A master's orders are definitive. A servant must
respond quickly. But if you'd like, I can recite
from the, ""Sun, go ahead and burn me"" part."	
Message	Shido	I... I am sorry, Origami-sama...	
Message	Origami	"It's truly calming. I know you're most suited for
crawling on the floor."	
Message	Shido	I... I am truly thankful for your praise.	
Message	Origami	How does the dirt taste?	
Message	Shido	Um, we're in the classroom...	
Message	Origami	What...?	
Message	Shido	No, it was nothing at all!	
Message	Origami	"...I see. I suppose I could give you one more
chance. Answer me, Shido. What were you
dreaming of?"	
Message	None	"(Gah... Maybe I'm going to have to make something
up...)"	
Choice		A date with Tohka.	
Choice		Taking a bath with Kotori.	
Choice		Stepping into the forbidden garden with Tonomachi.	
Message	Shido	A date with... Tohka, I guess?	
Message	Origami	I commend your honesty.	
Message	Shido	Th-Thank you.	
Message	Origami	I hereby declare your execution.	
Message	Shido	"Hey...! I thought there'd be more consideration
for circumstances like this."	
Message	Origami	"Then let me ask you. What kind of date were you
having with Tohka Yatogami?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, uh.... The Tohka in my dream really just
pushed for it..."	
Message	Origami	I suggest you answer my questions clearly.	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yes. I-I believe we were walking and eating as
usual."	
Message	Origami	I hereby declare your execution.	
Message	Shido	Why?!	
Message	Origami	"How dare you have fun eating with Tohka Yatogami
in your dreams. You are not properly behaving as
my servant, so your punishment will be execution."	
Message	Shido	But it was a dream! Please! Please forgive me.	
Message	Origami	If you really wish for it...	
Message	Shido	Then?	
Message	Origami	"You're going to recite the words I'm
about to tell you."	
Message	Shido	Yes!	
Message	Origami	Please forgive me, Origami-sama.	
Message	Shido	Please forgive me, Origami-sama!	
Message	Origami	My body forever belongs to Origami-sama.	
Message	Shido	M-My body forever belongs to Origami-sama!	
Message	Origami	I want to smell Origami-sama's scalp.	
Message	Shido	I wa... huh?	
Message	Origami	I want to smell Origami-sama's scalp.	
Message	Shido	"I...I want to smell Origami-sama's scalp... What
is up with that weird fetish?"	
Message	Origami	"You didn't put your heart into it. Back your words
with emotions, servant."	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay! I would love to smell your scalp, Origami-
sama. Sir!"	
Message	Origami	"Very well. Then I shall lighten your punishment in
response to your show of respect."	
Message	Shido	Yes, sir―!	
Message	Origami	"Rather than being executed, you must not eat
anything aside from crab."	
Message	Shido	Th-That's impossible.	
Message	Shido	I... had a dream of taking a bath with Kotori.	
Message	Origami	"To touch your little sister is the ultimate level
of gross."	
Message	Shido	No, that's not what I was doing.	
Message	Origami	You creep. You low-life pervert.	
Message	Shido	I-I object. It's not like that...	
Message	None	(Did I make the wrong choice?)	
Message	Origami	You should change your name to Pedo.	
Message	Shido	Listen to me. It's not like that.	
Message	Origami	City hall is to the left of the school gates.	
Message	Shido	"But I was only dreaming of a memory I had when
we were kids. It wasn't anything inappropriate..."	
Message	Origami	No excuses. The worst punishment, no doubt.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What...	
Message	Origami	"I have no choice but to release Shido Itsuka's
""secret file""."	
Message	Shido	What... is that file? What's in it?	
Message	Origami	"Your acapella recordings of that horrible
glam-idol song you made, back when you thought
you'd sing it at a school festival one day."	
Message	Shido	"Noooooooooo! Why does such a thing still exist in
this world?! I thought I threw it away!"	
Message	Origami	"An informant extracted it from the trash and
attempted to restore it. I obtained it through
an agent of mine."	
Message	Shido	"Then, it had to be Kotori! Or wait, was your agent
Reine-san?!"	
Message	Origami	"You are not in a position to ask questions, Shido.
If you don't want this exposed, tell me what you
must do next, Pedo."	
Message	Shido	"Please, don't kill me so publicly, Origami-sama!
And if possible, please stop calling me Pedo!"	
Message	Origami	"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. I thought you
said, ""Please step on me, Origami-sama.
Was that right?"""	
Message	Shido	Huh? I didn't say that.	
Message	Origami	"So are you saying your words are more accurate
than my ears, Shido? Despite your being my
servant?"	
Message	Shido	Well, obviously! Because...	
Message	Origami	"You should consider the predicament you're in,
Shido. Then maybe you can decide whether you
should talk back."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... I...	
Message	Origami	"So what were you saying? Say it loud enough
for me to hear you."	
Message	Shido	"Please step on me, Origami-sama. Please, please
step on me with your... holy foot."	
Message	Origami	"If you insist... Very well.
...So, how does it feel?
To be stepped on like trash."	
Message	Shido	"I-It makes me happy! I consider it the
highest honor!"	
Message	Origami	"I see. Good boy. If you're really happy,
oink for me."	
Message	Shido	O-Oink.	
Message	Origami	"Just so you know, I'm recording this conversation.
I suppose I could send it to your beloved little
sister."	
Message	Shido	Wait, calm down!	
Message	Origami	"I wonder what your little sister will think upon
hearing her brother's pathetic voice. She might
be so happy she'll cry."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I can see her liking it! But more of a
reason to not do it! Please, could you be
less extorting?!"	
Message	Origami	So you don't want me to send it?	
Message	Shido	Please don't!	
Message	Origami	You really don't want me to send it?	
Message	Shido	Please!	
Message	Origami	...If you say so.	
Message	Shido	Thank you, oh thank you so much.	
Message	Origami	And... sent.	
Message	Shido	Noooooooooooooooooo!	
Message	Shido	"You see... I had a dream of stepping into the
forbidden garden with Tonomachi... *grunt* I can't
say any more. Oh, why did I have such a dream?!"	
Message	Origami	"Wait, so you like men...? If you dreamt it, then
the deepest level of your consciousness wanted
it. It has been deemed as your deepest wish."	
Message	Shido	That can't be! I swear it's not.	
Message	None	(I was just saying anything that came to mind.)	
Message	Origami	"Oh, my word. So your relationship with
me was a sham."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, our relationship aside, it's not like
that. It must be some kind of mistake."	
Message	Origami	"I just came up with something fun. I'm going to
put your poems in a heart-shaped envelope and
put it in Tonomachi's mailbox."	
Message	Shido	"What a horrible way to bring about my dark
past... Y-You're... not serious, are you?"	
Message	Origami	"Whether I'm serious or not is dependent on your
attitude."	
Message	Shido	I-I'll do anything. So please, anything but that.	
Message	Origami	You need to be rehabilitated, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Rehabilitated...?	
Message	Origami	"That's right. You lack the proper mindset. That's
why you have weird dreams."	
Message	Shido	Um... you can't help what you dream.	
Message	Origami	"That's not true. If you maintain a certain mindset
on a daily basis, then you should be able to
manipulate your dreams accordingly."	
Message	Shido	R-Really? Is that possible...?	
Message	Origami	"Yes. That's why you must train, so you can have
healthy dreams."	
Message	Shido	Train?	
Message	Origami	"First, you're going to recite, ""I'm a pervert
ten times."""	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Origami	"Just do it. Or else, you will be tainted by the
image of being a jolly man-lover."	
Message	None	(If I do that, I won't have a place in class...!)	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert.
I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert.
I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert."	
Message	Origami	"""That was pretty good. Next, repeat the words
""Origami Tobiichi"" from the bottom of your heart
so it's massaged into your deepest consciousness."""	
Message	Shido	"Origami Tobiichi, Origami Tobiichi, Origami
Tobiichi, Origami Tobiichi, Origami Tobiichi,
Origami Tobiichi, Origami Tobiichi."	
Message	Origami	Then, what is this?	
Message	Shido	Elbow! Wait...? What are you talking about?	
Message	Origami	Don't mess around.	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Origami	"""Let's continue. Finally, say ""I keep daydreaming
of inappropriate things with Origami. Every day,
I dream of her in a perverted way"" ten times."""	
Message	Shido	"Long. That's too long?! And that isn't even an
appropriate dream!"	
Message	None	"(And so Origami tortured me like this until the
sun disappeared over the horizon.)"
