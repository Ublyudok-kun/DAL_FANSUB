Message	None	"(Today was my first day off since Kaguya and
I started officially dating. A date with just the
two of us. I was kind of nervous...)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's fine, but...
Why are you here, Yuzuru?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Answer. Shido, I am waiting with you for Kaguya
to arrive. I assume waiting is a turgid affair."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's sweet of you. I was kind of bored,
so I appreciate it. Did you want to come with
us, since you're already here?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Refusal. That I cannot do. You are Kaguya's
boyfriend. You must appreciate your time
alone together."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you think so? Well, I'm sure Kaguya wouldn't
mind. In fact, she might encourage it."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Kaguya loves Yuzuru. However,
alone time is important. Rules must be honored."	
Message	Shido	If you say so. Oh. I think she's here.	
Message	Kaguya	"Sorry for running late, Shido.
"	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, Yuzuru! Oh, thinking of coming with?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Refusal. Unfortunately, I will not join. I merely
wanted to see you off."	
Message	Shido	"Thanks for coming out, Yuzuru. Well, we'll
be on our way."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Warning. Shido, one word of advice. Kaguya's
tastes are notoriously finicky. Good luck."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Yuzuru	Departure. Well, I will be on my way.	
Message	Shido	Good luck...? What does she mean?	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, let's get going. If you keep me waiting,
the dark beast will awaken!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Let's go. You had somewhere in mind,
right?"	
Message	Kaguya	Yes. Come with me!	
Message	None	(Kaguya took me to...)	
Message	Shido	Is this a clothing shop?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. Indeed. I'm gonna pick the coooolest
clothes for you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	That's sweet of you. Wait, but you're picking?	
Message	Kaguya	C-Can't I?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I mean, I've never had a girl pick out
clothes for me before."	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku... Then prepare yourself for the most
epic transformation this decade. Okay, go
inside that room."	
Message	Shido	G-Got it...	
Message	None	"(Kaguya excitedly shoved me into a dressing
room, but...)"	
Message	Shido	All of a sudden, I feel anxious.	
Message	None	"(Should I really let her choose? Well, she
is my girlfriend. I should trust her. But wait
a minute... Kaguya's fashion sense is―)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Thanks for waiting! I had my eye on some stuff,
so I went ahead and bought it! I'll leave it here
for you. Call me, okay? I'm getting ready too!"	
Message	Shido	...Getting ready?	
Message	None	"(Is Kaguya changing too? Are we going to
match? That'd be embarrassing. Oh, well.
Guess I'll find out. Where are those clothes?)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, man. This is totally Kaguya's aesthetic.
It looks cool.)"	
Message	Shido	"But I feel like it's bringing me back to a time
I didn't necessarily want to remember..."	
Message	None	"(Well, guess I have to commit. I'm Kaguya's
boyfriend.)"	
Message	None	"(I mustered up the courage to try on the
black coat.)"	
Message	None	"(Together, Kaguya and I walked through the
shopping district.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, I knew it! Looking so cool!	
Message	Shido	Y-You think so...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku... Totally, Shido. The perfect look for my
servant."	
Message	Shido	Kaguya, I'm happy you like what you see.	
Message	Kaguya	Hm?	
Message	Shido	You look adorable, Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	"...Huhhh? Talk more like that and you'll make
me blush."	
Message	Shido	Why? You wanted to be twins, right?	
Message	Kaguya	"N-NNNNNNot really! I just thought it looked
cute! I thought you might look good in it, too."	
Message	Shido	"I see. You're right. It suits you, Kaguya.
A real cute outfit."	
Message	Kaguya	Hauuu. Hehehe. Thanks, Shido. You look cool too.	
Message	Shido	Think so? I kinda feel like it doesn't suit me.	
Message	Kaguya	"Don't worry. I can vouch for how cool you look,
so trust me. You're my boyfriend, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Haha. I get all pumped whenever you say it.	
Message	None	(I won't tell her about that, though...)	
Message	None	"(I'm sure, in our matching outfits, we really do
look like a serious couple. It was nice to see
Kaguya wear such a big smile.)"	
Message	Kaguya	All right. Onward and upward with our date!	
Message	Shido	Wait, in this outfit?!	
Message	Kaguya	"KAKAKA, Shido! A rendezvous demands
matching attire. You can't take it off
until the very end!"	
Message	Shido	Fine. I'll play along just for today, Princess.	
Message	Kaguya	Okay...!	
Message	Shido	But only today, okay?	
Message	Kaguya	"Kuku. You chose me, Shido. Your requests
are trivial."	
Message	Shido	I see. That's how you're going to play it, huh?	
Message	None	"(It's true I chose Kaguya. So I guess I can't
really be surprised it panned out like this.
Yuzuru's warning was lost on me...)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Besides, if you resist, I won't let go of your
arms."	
Message	Shido	That's not a threat. I don't want you to let go.	
Message	Kaguya	Then let's keep this good thing goin'.
