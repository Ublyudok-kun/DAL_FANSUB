Message	Shido	Whoaaa! You're here, you pervy monsters!	
Message	Kaguya	Ah, Sh-Shido?! N-No! That wasn't us.	
Message	Yuzuru	Strike. Hey, calm down Shido. Kaguya, you too.	
Message	Kaguya	Yuzuru, you're blushing too.	
Message	Shido	"Both of you calm down. So you guys are
home already?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. We were flown nearby.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... So this is the game master's choice,
is it?"	
Message	Shido	"Whatever. Anyways, did you guys want to eat dinner
with us? Where's Maria?"	
Message	Kaguya	Huh? I haven't seen her.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Observation. It appears that she hasn't returned
yet. Did you not bump into her outside?"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, my date started in the
middle of my search for her.)"	
Message	Shido	"Crap. Sorry guys, can you wait for dinner? I'm
going to go pick Maria up!"	
Message	Kaguya	"What are you saying, dutiful servant? Of course I
will be accompanying you."	
Message	Yuzuru	Concern. We will pick her up with you.	
Message	Shido	Oh, great. Thank you.	
Message	Shido	"Sorry that you had to come with me. You guys could
have stayed at home."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... I might as well. And besides, I wanted to
say something to her."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Kaguya just wanted to be with you,
Shido. She's just saying random things, so don't
worry."	
Message	Kaguya	Sh-Shut up! Yuzuru, you feel the same way too!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. So I do. So what? I just want to be
with you Shido, so don't mind me."	
Message	Kaguya	...N-Not fair! Something feels unbalanced!	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. Well, I feel better that you guys are
with me. Honestly, I don't know much about
Maria yet..."	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, are you anxious about something?	
Message	Shido	"...Just a little. I need to figure it out, or you
guys can't get out of this world. So maybe I just
feel pressure."	
Message	Kaguya	"...I see. Fear not, Shido... When the time comes,
then we Yamai Sisters will be with you."	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Kaguya is right. Shido, you have us.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Addition. Besides that, I have faith in you. You
saved the Yamai Sisters."	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, I was planning on saying that.	
Message	Shido	...Thanks, Kaguya. Yuzuru.	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe...	
Message	Yuzuru	Returning the favor. You are welcome.	
Message	Shido	"Now... Let's hurry and find Maria so we
can head home."	
Message	Shido	"And she was pretty easy to find... What are you
doing here, Maria...?"	
Message	Maria	So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Maria	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Shido	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Maria	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart
skips a beat, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	Kaguya	...*Stare*.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Demand. Have you had your fill, Shido?
We're waiting, too."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh. Sorry for the wait. Hey... Why are you
looking at me like that?"	
Message	Kaguya	It's nothing!	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Nothing.	
Message	Shido	Hey, what's up with that?!	
Message	Maria	Shido, let's hurry back.	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, wait!	
Message	Yuzuru	Sigh. Let's hurry back, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, okay, fine! Kaguya, Maria, if you guys
sandwich me from both sides, I can't walk.
Yuzuru, stop grabbing onto my hips!"	
Message	None	"(The three clung onto me as we headed home. But
even then, it felt like Maria had become a part of
the family. I felt happy.)"
