Message	None	(Now then, we made it to the shopping district.)	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. Shido, look here! There's an announcement
here about bread. It says it's ""All You Can Eat"",
but how is eating all their bread permissible?"	
Message	Miku	"Darling, please look over there. A maid café
packed with cute girls. Why don't we try
going there?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. Just you wait. I'll guide you to a store
that only I know of."	
Message	Kurumi	"Now then, Shido-san. Since we're here, why
don't you help me pick out some new underwear?"	
Message	Shido	"Calm down! I can't listen to everyone at once.
Besides, today is...!"	
Message	Ai	"My word. Do you see that? It's Itsuka-kun,
once again."	
Message	Mai	"He's got quite the crowd with him today.
An Itsuka harem."	
Message	Mii	Does he have to show off like that?	
Message	Shido	Gah. Here comes trouble!	
Message	Ai	"What do you mean ""trouble""?"	
Message	Mai	Hey, hey. Now you've done it, Itsuka-kun!	
Message	Mii	"We'll have to teach you to watch your mouth,
won't we?"	
Message	Shido	"Shoot. They heard me. Sorry, but I don't have
the time to deal with you guys right now."	
Message	Maria	Um. What should we do?	
Message	Kurumi	"Don't worry about it. He is being teased by some
of his schoolmates."	
Message	Maria	Teased?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes, correct. Still, Shido-san is quite popular.
Despite their attitudes, no one is outwardly
criticizing him."	
Message	Maria	Shido has so many friends. Is that a good thing?	
Message	Kurumi	"I wonder? Don't ask me. I'm sure the others
could offer an accurate opinion. Right,
Tohka-san?"	
Message	Tohka	*Munch, munch*... Hm?	
Message	Tohka	" Mm. That is right. Having many
friends is a good thing. Keeps things lively!"	
Message	Miku	"How'd you eat all that food so quickly? You're
amazing, Tohka-san."	
Message	Maria	Having friends is a good thing...	
Message	Shido	"Whew. I got them to leave. Sorry for keeping
you. So Maria, is there a place you'd like to go?"	
Message	Maria	...*stare*.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's wrong, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"I heard you have many friends, Shido. Were
those three girls your friends, too?"	
Message	Shido	"My friends? More or less. They're closer to
Tohka and the others, but not really with me.
They're just classmates of mine."	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Miku	"Um. This is just a suggestion, but why don't
we shop for a new wardrobe for Maria-san?
She doesn't have too many outfits."	
Message	Kaguya	"Ohh. Must be a divine revelation. I had the same
idea, so I will reveal the place where the gods
themselves find their attire."	
Message	Shido	Clothes? Is that what you want?	
Message	Maria	"I do not mind.
No, I'd like to shop for clothes too."	
Message	None	"(Huh? Why did she correct herself like that?
Maybe I'm overthinking it.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, well. All right. Let's browse the shops.	
Message	Miku	"Yes, yes. If everyone is okay with it, then I'll
take you to my favorite store."	
Message	Maria	I will leave it to you.	
Message	Miku	"Heeheehee. You're so honest and precious,
Maria-chan."	
Message	Kurumi	Totally unlike you.	
Message	Miku	Hmm. Did you say something～?	
Message	Kurumi	No, nothing at all. Ufufufufu...	
Message	Miku	Ah ha, ahahahaha...	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, let's go. Miku, could you show us
the way?"	
Message	Miku	Ah...	
Message	Miku	 Of course. Then, this way.	
Message	None	"(So we were on our merry way, under Miku's
guidance.)"	
Message	None	"(Once we had made it to the store, it was
surprisingly casual. I thought a pop star would
have recommended a more stylish place...)"	
Message	Miku	"Ah, your face says it all. You think it's plain,
don't you? Idols are still normal girls. It's
not what you wear, it's how you wear it."	
Message	Shido	"I see. I guess that's how it works. Still, it
seems strange for me to enter this place."	
Message	Tohka	"Check it out, Kaguya. The clothes here are
much cooler. Maria would most definitely
look dashing in this!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Ha ha. You must be jesting, Tohka. Behold,
this heavy cloak. Marvel at how it accentuates
Arusu's dark atmosphere."	
Message	Maria	Umm, um... Oh dear.	
Message	None	"(Then, the conversation took a turn for the
worse.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hey, Maria-san. What do you think of this
underwear? It's sure to coax a look from
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Aaaack. That's no good!	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, my. Undergarments are a woman's best
weapon, don't you know? Besides, weren't
you decisive when I asked you about mine?"	
Message	Shido	"No, I didn't understand the situation at the
time."	
Message	Maria	"Undergarments are a woman's best weapon?
What kind of effects does it have?"	
Message	Shido	"You don't need to answer her, Maria! Just
leave the underwear alone for now, and look
for clothes to wear on a date, okay?"	
Message	Maria	"Clothes to wear on a date? The concept is
unfamiliar to me. I have no experience buying
clothing."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, I see. What to do... I'm no good at putting
together women's outfits either."	
Message	Miku	"Leave everything to me. I'll coordinate
Maria-chan's top and bottoms to make
her electrifying～."	
Message	Shido	Ohh. As expected, Miku!	
Message	Kurumi	"How interesting. I'll assist however I can. It
seems that Shido-san doesn't prefer provocative
looks, so let's go with an understated outfit."	
Message	Maria	P-Please do.	
Message	Miku	"Yes, your stylists are here. With your figure,
Maria, I think a one-piece dress will fit you
nicely."	
Message	Miku	"Being prim and proper will work on you,
too. Aw. I can't tear my eyes off of this
frilly dress too～."	
Message	Kurumi	"Then, I will use my discretion to pull out a
few suitable tops."	
Message	Tohka	Shido, we're choosing outfits for Maria first!	
Message	Kaguya	"That's right, Shido! We request, with our
qualifications, to be given the first
opportunity!"	
Message	Shido	"Let's see. Why don't you two choose the
accessories? Like bags, or hats."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, a splendid idea!	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. What a fitting test for eyes like
ours. Then, Maria, prepare yourself!"	
Message	Shido	Hm. I wonder if that was the right move.	
Message	Maria	"It is fine, isn't it? They are doing their best
for my sake."	
Message	Shido	That's true...	
Message	Maria	"Are you worried, Shido? You and I are of
two minds. It is not worry that I am feeling."	
Message	Shido	Could it be... anticipation, excitement?	
Message	Maria	"Those descriptions apply here. Is this what
anticipation for the unknown feels like?
I cannot seem to calm down."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Yup, that's anticipation and excitement
for you."	
Message	Maria	Yes... Happy, happy. Joy, joy.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, she's in the changing room. I hope the
outfits all match and stuff. I'd feel bad if she
looked silly."	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm, Shido. What does that mean?
Our ""core-denation"" is perfect!"	
Message	Miku	"That's right. It's perfect. All right, let's have
the lady take the catwalk now. Come on out."	
Message	Maria	Um, how does it look?	
Message	Shido	OH... OHHHH!	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, state your actual impression. That is
your job."	
Message	Kurumi	"That's right, Shido-san. You must be forthcoming
in times like these."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, you're right. Sorry, Maria. It's cute.
Really suits you."	
Message	Maria	Does... it really? Is it not out of character?	
Message	Shido	"I was a little worried until I actually saw it,
but I think you look great. It's perfect."	
Message	Miku	"Happy to hear your approval, darling.
Kurumi and I chose the top and bottoms."	
Message	Tohka	In addition, I selected the hat!	
Message	Kaguya	"I chose the socks! Hehehe. Be mesmerized
by the Absolute Territory created by these
devilish leg garments!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Your thoughts, Shido-san? Everything is
well-coordinated to me."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. To be honest, I'm shocked.	
Message	Maria	Actually, I, too, am quite surprised.	
Message	Shido	Huh? You too, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Even though I merely changed into
different clothes, I am welling with joy.
What is the cause of this?"	
Message	Shido	Huh, I see.	
Message	Maria	Do you know why that is, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.
When others are kind to you, you just feel
good, Maria."	
Message	Maria	So what I'm feeling... is the kindness of others?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that'd explain it. No, I'm sure it is.	
Message	Maria	I see... This is happiness.	
Message	Tohka	Maria, it makes me happy when you're happy!	
Message	Miku	"Me too～. Now then, for coordinating the
perfect outfit for Maria-chan, we're getting
a reward from you, right darling?"	
Message	Shido	What? What do you... When did we decide that?	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. All you did was wait for the
presentation, Shido-san. The least you could
do is show us your appreciation, yes?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe. As a reward for our labors, I believe
an offering of sweets is in order, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Rgh. So you want me to pay for your food.
Well, if that's all, I guess I could do that."	
Message	Maria	Shido, could I partake in the offering as well?	
Message	Shido	Of course. You're absolutely included.	
Message	Maria	I see. I am glad.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, one more thing, Shido-san. You need
to pay for Maria-san's new attire as well."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Of course. Of course I get the bill.	
Message	None	"(After I finished paying, we left the shopping
district as a group.)"	
Message	None	"(For being able to see Maria in a new light,
I guess it was money well spent.)"
