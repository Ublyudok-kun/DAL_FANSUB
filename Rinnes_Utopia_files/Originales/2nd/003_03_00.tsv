Message	Shido	Ah, I'm finally alone.	
Message	None	"(I thought I'd finally regained my peaceful life.
Who would have thought it would be this
chaotic...)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, a phone call...? Oh... it's Reine-san.	
Message	None	"(Reine Murasame-san. She's like an assistant
to Kotori, and the main analyst of Ratatoskr.
She's also my assistant homeroom teacher.)"	
Message	None	"(When negotiating with the Spirits, she and
Kotori often give me instructions for dating.)"	
Message	None	"(I already have a bad feeling, hearing the phone
ring like this... But I can't ignore it.)"	
Message	Shido	...Hello?	
Message	Reine	"Hey, Shin. Seems like you did well on your\ndate today."	
Message	Shido	"Well, today was more of an accident than a
real mission."	
Message	Reine	"No, no... What you do on a daily basis is\nwhat's important. If you don't give food to the\nfish you caught, you'd just be a horrible man."	
Message	Shido	The fish I caught...	
Message	Reine	"Anyways, let's cut to the chase. You see, I\ncreated a new game."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	None	"(Huh? What does she want me to do with that
information? Wait... Reine-san created a game?
I have a very bad feeling about this.)"	
Message	Reine	"I like your expression. You're very sharp,\nShin. Exactly what you're thinking. I've created\nthe masterpiece, 'My Little Shido'."	
Message	Shido	"I knew it! Jeez, when did you find the time to
do that?"	
Message	None	"(My Little Shido... Before I started this
reckless series of dates with the Spirits, she
had me train on that game.)"	
Message	None	"(It's pretty much a gal game... Kind of in the
wrong direction, if you ask me.)"	
Message	Reine	"Right. We all made it without sleeping or\nresting. We would love for you to play it.\nI want you to come to the Fraxinus."	
Message	Shido	"If it's a game, I can play it at home... And
besides, I need to make dinner tonight."	
Message	Reine	"You still have some time before dinner.\nI need you to come to the Fraxinus to play\nit right now."	
Message	Shido	Hmm... Well, fine I'll go.	
Message	Reine	"Thanks. Then I'll prepare for your transfer,\nso come outside."	
Message	None	"(*Sigh*... I wonder what kind of game she
made this time...)"
