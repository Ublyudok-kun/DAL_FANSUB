Message	Mana	"Ohh, this is delicious! Super delicious,
Nii-sama!"	
Message	Shido	Eat a little slower, would you Mana?	
Message	Mana	"How am I supposed to slow down with
this meal? Search and Destroy! I won't
let it get away!"	
Message	Shido	No, no. It's not getting away...	
Message	None	"(By strange coincidence, I ended up having
lunch with Mana. Man, she sure can eat a ton.
Not exactly the daintiest portions.)"	
Message	Mana	Mrph! Urgh... It's... stuck...	
Message	Shido	Gaaaah! Here! Drink this, water!	
Message	Mana	*gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp*!	
Message	Shido	Slowly, slowly!!	
Message	Mana	Pheeeeeew. *pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	Are you okay?	
Message	Mana	Yes. That was embarrassing of me...	
Message	None	"(After Mana took one deep breath, she started
wolfing her food down again.)"	
Message	Mana	"Man, getting to dine with Nii-sama...
It tastes even freaking sweeter."	
Message	Shido	Glad to hear you say that.	
Message	Mana	Okay, for my next course...	
Message	Shido	...Wha?	
Message	None	"(Mana's bright voice made my cheeks twitch
lightly.)"	
Message	Mana	Nii-sama? What's freaking wrong?	
Message	Shido	No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.	
Message	None	"(Not yet. I should still be fine. I should...
have enough money!)"	
Message	Shido	"Mana, do you not normally go out to lunch
with other people?"	
Message	Mana	"Hmm. Not much at all. Normally, I have no
freaking clue when I'll be deployed, after all."	
Message	Mana	"Oh, but, but—! I'll always come to eat with
you, Nii-sama!"	
Message	None	"(I'm becoming more and more aware that
Mana doesn't live like we do. With a normal
life, that is.)"	
Message	None	"(If that's the case, then maybe it's for the
better if I meddle in her life a bit.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, if it's just a meal, then I'll always
hang out with you."	
Message	Mana	Really, Nii-sama?! I'm so moved!	
Message	None	"(Mana grinned with specks of food around
her mouth. Yup. She's not your typical girl.)"	
Message	None	"(She reminds me of Tohka and the others. I'd
like for Mana to live a normal life someday.)"	
Message	Mana	Oh, is it all right if I make my next order?	
Message	Shido	How about we get the check soon?!
