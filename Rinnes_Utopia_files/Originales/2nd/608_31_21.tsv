Message	Maria	"I had an excellent time. Shido, today was very
fun. I cannot thank you enough."	
Message	Shido	"Um, Maria? What are you saying? Aren't you
coming home with me?"	
Message	Maria	"Saying good-bye is also part of a date.
Will you allow me to do so today?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, I think I get it. If we're living together,
you won't experience meeting and parting."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. So today, we shall return separately.
Is this okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Sure thing, no problem. See you later, Maria.
It's still bright, but come home before it gets
dark."	
Message	Maria	"Hmph. Shido, you behave like a parent bidding
their child farewell."	
Message	Shido	Er, ah, right... This is surprisingly tough.	
Message	Maria	"However, Shido, is this not the time where you
say, "I'll take you home"?"	
Message	Shido	Um... I'll take you home, Maria.	
Message	Maria	"No, I am fine here. Our exchange would lose
all meaning otherwise."	
Message	Shido	Which is it, then?! Okay, I guess so...	
Message	Shido	See you, Maria.	
Message	Maria	Yes, Shido. Good-bye.	
Message	None	"(As she bid me farewell, Maria walked off.
Maybe I imagined it, but she looked forlorn,
despite us agreeing to meet up at home.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, if I leave now, we'll practically arrive
concurrently, so I should kill some time.)"	
Message	Shido	What should I do?	
Message	Shido	That's...	
Message	Shido	"Did she get away? The black-clothed one...
Arusu. I thought I saw her."	
Message	Shido	"Oogh. It's cold. Since I went and chased her,
the sun set and now it's freezing."	
Message	None	"(I could buy something warm at the nearest
convenience store.)"	
Message	Clerk	Thank you very much!	
Message	Shido	"Steamed buns are the best when it's cold.
...Huh?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, I thought you'd gone back.	
Message	Arusu	"Hmph. It is of no importance to you, Shido
Itsuka. Chasing after a woman, won't people
question your hobbies?"	
Message	Shido	That's not my hobby!	
Message	Arusu	"Perhaps I should believe you... So, what are
you holding?"	
Message	Shido	This? A steamed bun. You don't know what it is?	
Message	Arusu	I know. There's nothing I don't know.	
Message	Shido	All right. Here, you can eat it.	
Message	Arusu	...I don't need it.	
Message	Shido	"Just try and eat it. From the looks of it, you've
never eaten one. Here."	
Message	Arusu	"What? For something like that...
"	
Message	Arusu	Well, if you insist, I accept.	
Message	Shido	"No, don't just stare at it. Eat it. It won't be
any good once it's cold."	
Message	Arusu	Hm...	
Message	None	(She might not actually know how to eat it.)	
Message	Shido	*munch* Mmm, delicious!	
Message	None	(How was that...?)	
Message	Arusu	Terrible overacting.	
Message	Shido	Shut up! Be quiet and eat it!	
Message	Arusu	Hmph...	
Message	Arusu	It is quite delicious. Warm, and juicy...	
Message	Shido	Right? Isn't it good?	
Message	Arusu	Th-That's not completely untrue.	
Message	None	"(She's concentrating so hard on the bun, but
it's a half-hearted answer. Well, it's delicious,
so I guess it's fine.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm glad.	
Message	Arusu	What? Don't look at me.	
Message	Shido	It's nothing.	
Message	Arusu	"Just say it. You were thinking a stupid thought,
weren't you? It's written all over your face."	
Message	Shido	"I thought that your face resembles Maria's
when you eat something yummy."	
Message	Arusu	...?!	
Message	Shido	You two really are similar... Hey, ah! Hey!	
Message	Arusu	"I wasted too much time with you. That will
do for today."	
Message	Shido	Wait! I want to keep talking!	
Message	Arusu	Sorry. No can do. See you, Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	...She's strange.	
Message	None	(Both Maria, and that Arusu.)	
Message	Shido	All right. I'll head home.
