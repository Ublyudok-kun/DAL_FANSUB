Message	Miku	Oh, darling. Welcome home!	
Message	Shido	Whoa! You scared me! What are you doing, Miku?	
Message	Miku	"Gosh, darling, you're so rude.
I was waiting for you."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Well, I was just surprised to open the door
and see you here. Sorry about that Miku."	
Message	Miku	"Hehe. I'm not mad, so don't you worry. Anyways, I
did see a lot of that cute side of yours earlier."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, um... Hey, Miku...? Can you forget about our
date from earlier?"	
Message	Miku	Awww. But you were so cute, darling.	
Message	Shido	"That's what's embarrassing! Miku, you were in a
nurse's outfit. Wouldn't you be embarrassed if I
remembered that forever?"	
Message	Miku	"Oh, really? I wouldn't mind you seeing me in any
outfit. I mean, that was nothing. I am an idol,
after all."	
Message	None	"(I guess she has a point... Oh, that's right, I
was looking for Maria.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Miku. Have you seen Maria?	
Message	Miku	"Arusu-san? No, I haven't～ It doesn't seem like
she's home yet, either～"	
Message	Shido	"She's not home yet...? Oh, that's right. I was
looking for her at school."	
Message	None	"(Then does that mean she's still at school? That's
not good, I just left her there.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Miku. I've got to go pick up Maria. I know
you came all the way over here, but I'm sorry."	
Message	Miku	It's totally fine～ In that case, I'll go with you～	
Message	Shido	...What?	
Message	None	"(And so Miku and I went to go pick
up Maria together.)"	
Message	Shido	It feels weird to walk to school with you, Miku.	
Message	Miku	"Oh, come to think of it, you're right! I'm happy
because I can pretend we're going to school."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. Well, it is evening... Anyways, can I ask
you something?"	
Message	Miku	Sure～ What is it, darling?	
Message	Shido	"It's about Maria. I wonder what it is
that she wants."	
Message	Miku	"Gosh, darling. You're with me, but you're talking
to me about another girl?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. I couldn't help it...	
Message	Miku	"""Hehe, I'm only kidding. Hmm... You mean the ""what
is love"" thing, right?"""	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Maria said she wants to learn from us. But
I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job."	
Message	Miku	"Hehe. I think you're doing okay. I mean, I feel so
much love just by being with you."	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Miku	"Yes, of course! Maybe Arusu-san just
wants your love?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't know about that. I don't think so. But... I
feel better just talking about it with you."	
Message	Miku	Hehe. You're welcome.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria! Where are you?	
Message	Miku	Darling, could that be Arusu-san?	
Message	Shido	...You're right. There she is.	
Message	Maria	So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Maria	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Shido	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Maria	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart
skips a beat, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	Miku	"Grrr. Darling, are you getting all lovey-dovey
with Arusu-san?"	
Message	Shido	Oh...?! N-No, Miku. It's not like that.	
Message	Maria	...Shido, do you not feel anything toward me?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? No, that's not true.	
Message	Miku	Oh, so your heart was pounding?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it was... Crap!	
Message	Miku	So it's true. Ohhhh. I seeeeee.	
Message	Shido	"*Groan*... Her eyes are piercing. Anyways Maria,
let's go home. You're okay with that, right Miku?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. Understood.	
Message	Miku	I don't mind. Have you had enough, darling?	
Message	Shido	Argh! Let's just go home, you guys.	
Message	Miku	Darling!	
Message	None	"(I held Miku's hand as I started to walk. I looked
over and Maria was smiling.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hm...? Oh, sure.	
Message	None	"(Maria slowly walked beside me, and I took her
hand. The three of us began to walk home together.
Maria has truly became part of our family.)"	
Message	None	"(We continued to hold each others' hands as we
walked home.)"
