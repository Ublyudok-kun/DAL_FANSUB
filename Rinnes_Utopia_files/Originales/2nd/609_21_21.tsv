Message	Shido	*sigh*... Whew. Are we close to the end?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It is going well. I wonder if everyone
else is safe."	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry. They'll absolutely pull through.
...Do you know where Marina is?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. We are almost there.	
Message	Maria	If we connect the coordinates... We are here!	
Message	Marina	"You're late, Shido Itsuka. And Maria, my
copy..."	
Message	Shido	Marina...! Maria is no copy!	
Message	Marina	"No matter what you say, it doesn't not
change the fact that she is a copy."	
Message	Shido	"I don't care! Maria is Maria! And Marina is
Marina! Both of you exist here! It's not a
matter of who's real or fake!"	
Message	Marina	"It is true that both she and I have a will, and there
is no mistaking our lives are separate.
You are right there, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Marina... You understand?	
Message	Marina	"I suppose. I can acknowledge it, if you mean
in objective terms."	
Message	Maria	You will... acknowledge me?	
Message	Marina	That's right. Here, let's make up.	
Message	Shido	Are you... serious?	
Message	Marina	"I'm serious. I'll stop this. If Maria...
acknowledges me."	
Message	Maria	Then... Then I will...	
Message	Shido	Wait. Don't get too close, Maria!	
Message	Marina	Yes, Shido Itsuka. Don't move.	
Message	Shido	Rgh...	
Message	Marina	Then, here. Let's shake.	
Message	Maria	Yes...	
Message	Marina	...	
Message	Shido	...?! Don't! MARIAAAAAAAA!!	
Message	Marina	It's too late. You're useless, Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Maria	Kyaaaaaaah!	
Message	Shido	Maria...? Hey, Maria!	
Message	Marina	"Ah... Ahahahaha! You're SUCH an idiot! How
was it not obvious what would happen? Are
you that dense? Another one bites the dust."	
Message	Maria	Ma...ri...na...	
Message	Shido	What did you do to Maria?!	
Message	Marina	"I absorbed her remaining authority. This was
the only way to usurp the connection. With this,
my Spirit power is limitless. My Astral Dress...!"	
Message	Shido	This...	
Message	Marina	Hee hee... Hehaha... Hehe... Ahahahaha!!!!	
Message	None	"(I gulped at her overwhelming presence.
I watched as time itself warped around her
awe-inspiring form.)"	
Message	None	"(She was greater, more terrifying, than
any Spirit I had ever faced. The only feeling
I could muster was overwhelming fear.)"	
Message	Maria	D-Do not... Shido... Please, run...	
Message	Marina	"There's no escape in this world. You'll
all disappear... Disappear! Hee hee. Aha...
Ahahahahah!"	
Message	Marina	"After all, you can't stop me anymore. Not
with all the power I've gained!"	
Message	Shido	Marina, you...	
Message	Marina	"So long as I exist in this realm, no one can
challenge me! It's over. All over. Too bad,
Shido Itsuka. Your brilliance ends here."	
Message	Shido	What do you plan to do with that power?!	
Message	Marina	"Destroy. Destroy everything. After all, that
is all I can do. I cannot touch the real world."	
Message	Shido	You... can't touch it?	
Message	Marina	"Yes. Didn't you know? After all, I am no
different from that girl. I have no body in
the real world. I'm just a clump of data."	
Message	Maria	You only exist in this world too...?	
Message	Marina	"That's right. Hence why we made a connection.
Did I sympathize with you? Or did I want a
friend? Huh? Why? I don't know. I don't know!"	
Message	Shido	This is bad...! Maria, get behind me!	
Message	Maria	Shido—!	
Message	Shido	Don't worry. Stay back, Maria.	
Message	Marina	"I see. So that's your power... Resist as much
as you'd like. It holds no candle to me!"	
Message	Shido	"I know, but even so, I have to do this! I'm
the only who can stop you!"	
Message	Marina	"Ohh. I see. Efreet's regeneration powers.
You're resilient, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	This still hurts, you know!	
Message	Marina	"Jumping in only to hurt yourself. You are
a special entity, one who can seal a Spirit and
use it yourself, Shido Itsuka. A contradiction."	
Message	Shido	I'm... a contradiction?	
Message	Marina	"You say you fight for them, but you have
sealed the Spirits' powers away. You say it
is too dangerous. That you want them to live."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that's right...	
Message	Marina	"But to what end? The Spirits are forced to
sit and watch, as you use their powers to
the same effect as them."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Marina	"For the one who says Spirits are unnecessary,
you're the one who uses their powers most.
Can't you see that?"	
Message	Shido	Ngh... I... I... That's not...	
Message	Marina	"Shido Itsuka, you are a hypocrite. That's why
you cannot deny my power. You could never
negotiate a say in the first place!"	
Message	Shido	"But, even so! Wanting to help someone who's
suffering in front of me, who's in pain...
Isn't that normal?!"	
Message	Marina	"Then, you should accept your fate. Begone
for my sake! I'm suffering too, aren't I?!"	
Message	Maria	Shido!!	
Message	Shido	It's okay, Maria. I'll keep you safe.	
Message	Maria	Shido, but... Your wounds!	
Message	Marina	"Next is Hermit's power. See, you call upon that
power once more. The power you supposedly
detest. Yet there it is, in your hands!"	
Message	Shido	"I have to! Right now, it's the only way to
protect the people most important to me!"	
Message	Marina	"That is why you are a contradiction... and a
hypocrite!"	
Message	Shido	"So what if I'm a hypocrite! I... I'll do whatever
it takes to protect the people I care about!
Anything! That's for me to decide!"	
Message	Marina	Then... Then, come here and save me too!	
Message	Shido	Mari...na...?	
Message	Marina	"But you cannot. You know nothing about my
past, my birth into loneliness. This is the path
laid before me. I'll destroy it all, turn it to ash!"	
Message	None	"(Listening to her speak, a thought came over
me.)"	
Message	None	"(It's possible that Marina was simply lonely...
That she was desperately searching for
fulfillment.)"	
Message	Reine	Shi... Shin... Can you hear me?	
Message	Shido	"...Reine-san? I can hear you. But the situation
is a real mess."	
Message	Reine	...I see. I have a report.	
Message	Shido	"I'd be happy if it contains some way for us
to come back."	
Message	Reine	"I think you've already realized, but the
majority of the Fraxinus' system has
been seized."	
Message	Shido	"Is it because Marina stole the ship's
master control?"	
Message	Reine	"Yes. Sadly we have no time. We tried interfering
with the main cannon, but it was no use. All
that is left... is to do something about Marina."	
Message	Shido	"Damn it. At this rate, who knows what'll
happen to the Fraxinus, and the world below."	
Message	Marina	"Ahahaha... You don't even worry about your
own life. Not that it matters, since the end is
nigh for everyone."	
Message	Tohka	"...What? They have grown stronger all of a
sudden!"	
Message	Origami	At this rate, we will be pushed back.	
Message	Tohka	Rgh... Shido, please. We will not last long!	
Message	Yoshino	K-Kotori-san, all of a sudden, they...	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. Their power is surging. We have to
keep going..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"This doesn't look too good, does it?!"	
Message	Kotori	"I don't want to hear your whining. All we
can do is believe in Shido."	
Message	Yoshino	I'll believe. I'm sure... Shido-san will do it.	
Message	Kotori	You're right. Do your best, Onii-chan.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. The copies who were once defeated
have risen back to action."	
Message	Miku	"They're like zombies. It's creepy. In fact,
this is a spooky situation..."	
Message	Kurumi	Don't panic. We can still manage them...	
Message	Miku	"True, but we can't hold them back
forever, can we?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes, you're right. We can only hope Shido-san
is doing his best."	
Message	Miku	"You're right. I'm sure darling is taking care
of business."	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes... Then we'll have to match him on the
battlefield, won't we?"	
Message	Miku	Yes! Here we go!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Observation. The enemy's power seems to
be rising dramatically."	
Message	Kaguya	"Rgh... Looks like my Demon Eye spell has lost
its effect."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Doubt. Your Demon Eye spell only works for
predicting the future, does it not?"	
Message	Kaguya	U-Um...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Proposal. Great danger is approaching.
We must unite our powers once more."	
Message	Kaguya	"If that's what fate's compass decrees, we
would be amiss not to have a meeting of
wings."	
Message	Yuzuru	Surprise. You seem calm, Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	...Yeah. Because Shido's here.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. I feel the same. Here they come.
Defend."	
Message	Kaguya	"...Understood! Lord of my covenant, if it is
you, we will surely overcome this abyss...
Conquer them!"	
Message	Marina	"You know you're going to disappear, so there's
no need to delay the inevitable... Save yourself
the trouble!"	
Message	Shido	I told you. I'm hardy!	
Message	Maria	"Shido... Please, leave me. At this rate, you
will..."	
Message	Shido	"No, I'll handle it. Maria and Marina...
I want to save you both!"	
Message	Marina	...! Don't joke around!	
Message	Shido	Ngh!	
Message	Maria	Shido!!	
Message	None	(Marina's blow wallops against me.)	
Message	None	(In that moment...)	
Message	None	"(As if awakened by the strike, something
inside of me was ready to burst out. Like I
remembered something I had forgotten.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(I identified what the sensation was.
What happened here, beyond my date
with Maria.)"	
Message	None	"(We made so many memories, experienced
so many things. Maria Arusu was right by our
side, and tried her hardest to change.)"	
Message	None	"(And she did change. That's why... I don't
want it to end here...!)"	
Message	Shido	I-I...	
Message	Maria	Shido! Shido!! Are you okay, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Maria	"If you were not defending, you would
have time to attack. If I become your
shield, then I could be of use—"	
Message	Shido	"...! Don't say something so stupid! Being
useful or not doesn't matter! That's not
why I'm protecting you!"	
Message	Maria	Sh-Shido...?	
Message	Shido	"Because I like you, Maria. Because you're
important to me. That's why I am compelled
to protect you!"	
Message	Shido	"You see, Maria. People shouldn't be judged
by their usefulness... Those aren't reasons
to cut someone off!"	
Message	Marina	"The words of a saint. Too bad the world is
filled with wicked people. Besides, that girl
is data. Why ever would you protect her?"	
Message	Shido	"Maria... is Maria. Do I need any other reason
other than that? Whether or not she is data
doesn't matter."	
Message	Marina	"It... doesn't matter? You think a machine
can feel actual emotions?"	
Message	Shido	"The Maria Arusu I know is a regular girl, has
all sorts of interests, and she laughs, cries,
and experiences both happiness and sadness."	
Message	Maria	Shido, that is...	
Message	Shido	"You know, don't you? You don't really know
her! Maria, day by day, has been growing! So,
you don't get it. Maria is a real girl!"	
Message	Maria	"Shido... Did you remember everything?
All of the contents that have been simulated
until now..."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'm not sure why though...	
Message	Maria	"Is it possible, because I have lost authority,
that the protection locking Shido's memories
has...?"	
Message	Marina	"I see. Well, it's nice of you to have remembered.
But what's the point in acknowledging it? Are
you going to try to say I'm the same?"	
Message	Shido	"That's right. Marina, you're the same as Maria.
You're not data. You're a normal girl!"	
Message	Marina	"You're wrong. In the end, I'm just a fake.
Not a human, not a Spirit. How could I be
a regular girl? What a laugh..."	
Message	Shido	This is nothing to laugh at!	
Message	Marina	...!	
Message	Shido	"I know. I know you erased Tonomachi,
but I know a different side to you as well.
Like when you saved that grandma."	
Message	Marina	That's... There was motive behind it!	
Message	Shido	"So it was on a whim? That's fine, too.
But one thing is certain!"	
Message	Marina	Certain...?	
Message	Shido	That's right. You're changing too!	
Message	Marina	I-I... I'm...	
Message	Shido	"Back then, you swatted my hand away when
I tried to pat you, but you didn't seem to
dislike it either."	
Message	Marina	"That's... just your assumption! In no world
did I like it! Stop it, Shido Itsuka. Do not
confuse me!"	
Message	Shido	"I won't stop! You can decide your own
future! It's too early to give up like that!"	
Message	Marina	Stop... Stop stop stop!! Don't give me hope!	
Message	Maria	"Most likely, you will not be able to block
this! Shido, run!!"	
Message	Shido	"No. I'm not going to run! If I do, then I'll be
a liar! I swear to you, Maria—and Marina—I'll
save you!"	
Message	Marina	"All I need is Father... The one who created
me, who gave me purpose. Everything is
from Father, so I... I—!!!"	
Message	Shido	"Ngh... This might be... too much. No... I'll
endure this! I'll protect Maria, even if it
kills me!"	
Message	Maria	"You cannot, Shido! Your existence is too
precious. If you were to die, Shido, then—"	
Message	Maria	"Everyone... No, I am wrong. I, myself, would
be overwhelmed by grief, despairing."	
Message	Maria	Please, give me the strength to protect Shido.	
Message	Maria	"I... wish to protect Shido. I do not want to
lose him... for everyone, and for myself."	
Message	Maria	He is more important than anyone else.	
Message	Marina	What... is this power?!	
Message	Shido	What the...?!	
Message	Maria	It seems the world has not yet abandoned me.	
Message	Shido	Maria, that form...	
Message	Marina	Is that... an Astral Dress?	
Message	Maria	"A part of the Fraxinus' control has been
transferred. Because of this, I could generate
a fake Astral Dress."	
Message	Marina	When was my control relinquished?!	
Message	Maria	"I am unsure. I merely prayed. The world...
The Fraxinus responded to it."	
Message	Maria	"This power was willed into a being. One that
is an embodiment of my emotions. The power to
protect Shido—he who is most important to me."	
Message	Marina	"It would never bend in your favor! You're
destined to disappear, like any copy would!
I am the one who will defeat you, begone!"	
Message	Maria	"Shido, I'm right here. Interference initiated...
Transferring power, disrupting coordinates."	
Message	Shido	With this—!	
Message	Marina	"No way... Why can't I reach?! The space...
No, are you interfering with the program
itself?!"	
Message	Maria	"Let us combine forces for one more powerful
attack. Marina is likely expecting it as well."	
Message	Shido	Got it. I'm counting on your support!	
Message	Maria	"Leave it to me. I'll stop her! Coordinates
locked—"	
Message	Maria	NOW!!	
Message	Shido	Got it! GOOOOOOO!!	
Message	Maria	"Marina. Please give it a little more thought.
Could we never come to an understanding?"	
Message	Marina	KYAAAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Maria	It appears the collapse has been halted.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Did it... work out?	
Message	Maria	"I have intervened in the system process, and
stopped the main cannon from firing."	
Message	Shido	I see. Thank goodness...	
Message	Reine	"Shin, can you hear me? Control of the Fraxinus\nis returning, and the Realizer has stabilized."	
Message	Shido	Looks like we did it in time.	
Message	Reine	"...Yes, well done. It's quite an achievement."	
Message	Shido	"No, there's still one thing to do. Where did
Marina go?"	
Message	Maria	Shido, to the Mother Room! I have a bad feeling!	
Message	Shido	All right!	
Message	Shido	Marina!	
Message	Marina	"Aaaa... Where did I go wrong? When did these
feelings arise? No... No no no no no!"	
Message	Shido	Marina...?	
Message	Marina	"I can... no longer return. I can't return to
either world, stuck in limbo..."	
Message	Shido	"Marina! Hey, what's wrong! Listen to me,
Marina—"	
Message	Marina	I don't want this. Someone, please. Erase me.	
Message	Reine	"...! What is this reaction?!"	
Message	Shido	Is this—?!	
Message	Maria	Shido, the situation has become dangerous.	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, I have bad news. There's a problem\nwith the Fraxinus' aerial system."	
Message	Shido	But you just said control had returned.	
Message	Reine	"...That should have been the case. It seems\nshe had a contingency plan."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Set the output for the Basic Realizer to\nmax! Please recover!! What... Did you say\nthe system is locked?!"	
Message	Reine	"...While we were recalibrating, the main\nsystem locked up. We cannot recover the\ncontrols."	
Message	Shido	"Please wait, Reine-san! At this rate, is it
possible..."	
Message	Reine	"Yes. The Fraxinus will descend upon Tengu\nCity. A heavy airship loaded with a Realizer in\na critical state. The outcome seems obvious."	
Message	Shido	Do you mean, it could damage the city?	
Message	Reine	"...I'll be frank with you. If the Fraxinus were\nto fall in this state, it would wipe out all of\nTengu City."	
Message	Shido	What did you say?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"Rgh. Our altitude is falling! There's no\nresponse from the Control Realizer either!\nWe can't even access manual controls..."	
Message	Reine	"...At this rate, the Fraxinus will undoubtedly\nfall atop Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	No way. Then, what can we...	
Message	Reine	"Shin, erase Marina. There is no other way."	
Message	Shido	Erase... That's...	
Message	Reine	"Nothing can be done about the system lock with\nour controls. We have no methods of recourse.\nWe can only erase the authority holder."	
Message	Shido	...Rgh! Why?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"On our end, we'll do everything we can to\ndelay the descent. However, we can't hold on\nforever."	
Message	Shido	I...	
Message	Maria	Shido, Marina is—!	
Message	Shido	What... is that weird black mass?	
Message	Maria	"She is absorbing the data around here, but
her body cannot withstand all of it at once.
Soon she will deteriorate."	
Message	Shido	No... Are you serious?! Can she not hear us?	
Message	Maria	If we could drag her out of there, or...	
Message	Shido	Then, Sandalphon!	
Message	Shido	No way. Did it not work at all?	
Message	Maria	"No, its power is insufficient. Her rate of
absorption is regenerating her as well."	
Message	Shido	Then, I just have to keep at it...!	
Message	Maria	"It's no use. No matter how many times you
attempt, it is impossible! She is healing too
quickly!"	
Message	Shido	Then what can we do?!	
Message	Shido	"Rgh. We're just too far. It's ridiculous! How
can we get closer?!"	
Message	Maria	If only I was... stronger... OH!	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Maria?	
Message	Maria	...I will go.	
Message	Shido	Maria, what do you mean?	
Message	Maria	I have an idea... Leave it to me.	
Message	Shido	But how? With what attack...?	
Message	Maria	"I am fine. I will definitely reach her. This
is something I must do alone."	
Message	Shido	Maria, hey... MARIA?!	
Message	None	"(Maria dove into the maelstrom of energy,
letting her Astral Dress absorb the damage.)"	
Message	Maria	Forward... Must push forward...! Ngh!	
Message	Shido	Maria?!	
Message	Shido	Yoshino! Kotori!!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san! You're safe...!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, looks like we're just in time.	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, Kotori! I'm glad you're all right.	
Message	Kotori	"Of course we are. How about you guys? For
now, it seems like the Fraxinus's cannon is
taken care of."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but now it's about to fall right into
Tengu City."	
Message	Kotori	"That's an even worse situation! Guess we'll
have to do something about that."	
Message	None	"(Kotori pointed at the raging black mass as
she spoke.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"That thing is outta control! We can't get\nclose in these conditions!"	
Message	Shido	"Maria dove in there, just now. Thankfully
you two came to back me up."	
Message	Kotori	Maria dove in... Why?	
Message	Shido	She said there's something she has to do.	
Message	Maria	"Can you hear me, Shido? Soon, I will be
able to connect with Marina."	
Message	Shido	Maria's voice...? A communication...	
Message	Maria	"In actuality, there is one sure method that
would erase Marina."	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Maria	"If I connect with Marina—using the data that
I had accumulated in this world—sharing this
with her will cause an overflow."	
Message	Shido	An overflow...? Then what would happen?	
Message	Maria	"Marina and I will disappear, putting an end
to the world's collapse."	
Message	Shido	"Does that mean both of you will disappear?
No, you absolutely can't!"	
Message	Maria	"This is the best chance we have. For
everyone—for you—to live."	
Message	Shido	If it's for my sake, then don't sacrifice yourself!	
Message	Maria	"Shido, I apologize for being selfish in this
moment, after all the times you protected me.
But to me, you are the most impo—"	
Message	Shido	Maria! Hey, Maria!	
Message	Kotori	...Maria's right.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, you too?! There has to be a way to
save both of them! I won't give up!"	
Message	Kotori	"That black mass... If we can't get through
to the Astral Dress, then we can't stop the
Artificial Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	"If Maria touches the Astral Dress, she can
disrupt the energy field. She and only she
can do it."	
Message	Shido	"But that's not the best method. Neither Maria
nor Marina can disappear!"	
Message	Kotori	"It's not like I want Maria to disappear either!
But we don't have time! We can't deliberate
over this!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm. We merely need to destroy that, right?	
Message	Shido	Tohka, Origami! You're safe.	
Message	Origami	There's no problem. We will attack the target.	
Message	Kurumi	"It is quite large, so it will be difficult if we
do not focus on a single point. Miku-san,
will you assist me?"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, of course～. With my Gabriel, our timing
will be pitch perfect!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. A total simultaneous attack. For the
Yamai Sisters, it'll be effortless. Child's play."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. We have mastered the art of
attacking in sync."	
Message	Shido	Kaguya and Yuzuru!!	
Message	Yoshino	"Kotori-san, I'll... do my best too! So, please,
for Maria-san..."	
Message	Kotori	"Ahh, man! I said I wanted to save her too,
didn't I? At this point, it's an all-out battle!"	
Message	Kotori	"Miku, please adjust your timing! Kaguya and
Yuzuru will attack first. Everyone will follow!
Shido, strike her once the Astral Dress recovers!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, got it! I'm counting on you, everyone!	
Message	Kotori	"Let's start already. Here we go! 3, 2, 1...
Miku!"	
Message	Miku	Leave it to me～. Gabriel, March!!	
Message	Yuzuru	Activation. Raphael!	
Message	Kaguya	...El Kanaph!	
Message	Origami	Target confirmed. Calibrating aim... Attacking.	
Message	Kurumi	"Kihihihi... The target is too big for missing
to be possible. ZAFKIEEEEEEL!!"	
Message	Yoshino	Maria-san, please hang in there...! Zadkiel...!!	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, I'll leave the rest to you! Camael...
Megiddo!"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, we believe in you! Sandalphon,
Halvanhelev!!"	
Message	Shido	Everyone, thank you. With this...!!	
Message	Shido	GOOOOOOOOOO!!	
Message	Tohka	"All right! With this! Now run, Shido!!
You must go, so hurry!"	
Message	Shido	Right. Wait for me, Maria!
