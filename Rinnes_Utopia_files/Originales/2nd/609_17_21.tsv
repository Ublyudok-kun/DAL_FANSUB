Message	Tohka	"Rgh... Curse this. Their numbers won't decrease!
How annoying!"	
Message	Marina	"You talk big for someone struggling so much.
You should give up already."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph. Do not underestimate us. This is
still just a test! Sandalphon!"	
Message	Tohka	"She dodged it?! No, am I under some type
of spell?"	
Message	Marina	I see... Not too bright, are you, Princess?	
Message	Tohka	"Why can't I land a hit? The space distortions
are getting to me..."	
Message	Marina	Done already? Then, I guess it's my turn.	
Message	Tohka	Ngh! What is this...?! The enemy split!	
Message	Marina	Hee hee. Prepare for total annihilation.	
Message	Tohka	Aaaaaaugh! ...Rgh!	
Message	Marina	You survived. I underestimated you.	
Message	Tohka	That attack was nothing!	
Message	Marina	"Your Astral Dress, Adonai Melek, seems
rather sturdy. But, is it only a matter of
time?"	
Message	Tohka	"Time? What are you...
"	
Message	Tohka	Ngh... What is this... My body is... heavy?!	
Message	Marina	"Using my copies as intermediaries, I'm
manipulating space and time itself, including
your Astral Dresses and Angels."	
Message	Tohka	"Manipulating?! How, I do not understand what
you're saying! All I need to do is avoid you!"	
Message	Marina	If you can. But there's...	
Message	Marina	A lot of me, you know?	
Message	Tohka	"*pant, pant*... Rgh. I cannot move. This is
troubling..."	
Message	Marina	Well, almost time to say good night.	
Message	Tohka	This is bad. At this rate...!	
Message	Marina	...?! I can't move... Ngh!	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami. Release your Astral Dress
and Angel at once. Then, manifest them
once more. It should reset you."	
Message	Tohka	Understood. I'll try it!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh, I feel light! Y-You saved me, Origami
Tobiichi."	
Message	Origami	"In order to locate Shido, we must hurry
to eliminate these pests. It was all part of
my mission. I didn't save you."	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm. I see. Still, I thank you. Being saved by
you is irritating, but if we don't stop them
now, Shido will be in danger."	
Message	Marina	Goodness. How bothersome.	
Message	Origami	"If it is to protect Shido, I have no choice but
to support Tohka Yatogami."	
Message	Tohka	"Rgh, I cannot stomach you! But we will survive
this together, Origami Tobiichi!"	
Message	Origami	I know that without you needing to tell me.	
Message	Marina	"Hee hee. There's no way you can hurt me
without your equipmen—"	
Message	Origami	Why do you think we can't?	
Message	Marina	Wha? Rgh!	
Message	Origami	"All I need to do is attack, make simple
adjustments, and we will gain the upper
hand."	
Message	Tohka	What do you mean, Origami Tobiichi?	
Message	Origami	"This world is not a normal digital world.
It is the Artificial Spirit's Territory."	
Message	Origami	"If it is casting Territory through the Realizer,
then I am versed in its capabilities."	
Message	Tohka	Hm, I see... So what does that mean?	
Message	Origami	"The reason your attacks aren't landing is
because space itself is being manipulated.
I can nullify that."	
Message	Tohka	I see! Which means...	
Message	Origami	That's right.	
Message	Tohka	If we work together—	
Message	Origami	We can win.	
Message	Marina	You think it'll be that easy?!	
Message	Marina	Wha, I'm surrounded!	
Message	Tohka	I see. It's completely different than earlier.	
Message	Origami	"The enemy's numbers are greater. We must
annihilate them with the fullest extent of our
ability. And leave no trace."	
Message	Tohka	I understand. Leave it to me!	
Message	Marina	Rgh. I won't allow it!	
Message	Origami	I won't let you.	
Message	Origami	"You telegraph your movements too much.
Your pathetic attempts make it easy to counter."	
Message	Marina	It can't be... Am I... going to lose...?	
Message	Origami	"Consider us the superior opponents.
Besides, I... am only trying to buy time."	
Message	Tohka	"This is the end! Sandalphon... Halvanhelev!
EAAAAT THIIIIIIIIS!"
