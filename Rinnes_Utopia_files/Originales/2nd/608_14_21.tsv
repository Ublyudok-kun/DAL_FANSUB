Message	None	"(Maria's transfer made for a busy morning, but
now that everyone's getting used to her being
around, the class is progressing as normal.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hrrm...	
Message	Origami	Hm...	
Message	None	"(However, I've caught both Tohka and Origami
glaring at me from time to time. My desk is so
close to theirs. Scary, but I'm used to it.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hey, Shido-san. Are you as bored as I am?
If you'd like, it might be more fun to leave
those two and go someplace else."	
Message	None	"(From behind me, I hear a voice of temptation.
Ignore it. Just focus.)"	
Message	None	"(Even still, with the situation being a little
stranger than usual, class is going on as it
usually did.)"	
Message	None	(I wonder what Maria's up to...)	
Message	None	"(She's not taking notes. She's just staring at
the chalkboard, her posture is upright. I'm sure
she's paying attention, but she sticks out.)"	
Message	Tamae	"Sooo, then. Is there anyone who could tell us the
answer for this problem?"	
Message	None	"(Tama-chan stood at the podium, trying to
hold her students' interest, but the class was
silent. No one raised their hand to answer.)"	
Message	Maria	......	
Message	None	"(Except for... Ohh? Maria raised her hand.
Maybe she couldn't bother to keep silent?)"	
Message	Tamae	Oh, Arusu-san. Do you know the answer?	
Message	None	"(Maria shot up from her seat. It seems she
did.)"	
Message	Maria	Before I answer, I have a question.	
Message	Tamae	Y-Yes? What would that be?!	
Message	Maria	"This textbook contains poorly-written prose
with awful grammar. It intentionally obscures
the content. How are we to learn from this?"	
Message	Tamae	Huuuh?!	
Message	None	"(Hey now. Questioning the actual textbook...
I don't think the teacher's ever seen that
before.)"	
Message	Tamae	Ah, um...	
Message	None	"(I'm sure there's truth to what she said, but
this is... Man, I almost feel bad for her.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria... Maria!	
Message	Maria	...? Oh, of course.	
Message	None	"(Hm? When I called to her, she reacted,
almost like in realization.)"	
Message	Maria	"Teacher, I apologize. My point was irrelevant
to your lesson. It was wrong of me to bring it up.
I will endeavor to study more."	
Message	Tamae	"U-Uhhh...? I-It's fine.
You can go at your own pace, Arusu-san."	
Message	Maria	Thank you. I will be careful from now on.	
Message	None	(Whew, seems like it worked out.)	
Message	Maria	...Hee hee.	
Message	None	"(My eyes met with Maria's. She had a faint
smile.)"
