Message	Shido	Y-Yoshino?! You're here?!

on her left hand. She was the next Spirit I met
after Tohka.)"	
Message	None	"(Normally, she's in the Spirit Mansion next door,
or on the Fraxinus with my sister Kotori, but
there are days she comes by to visit.)"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	*Sniffle*... Eh... Waaa...	
Message	Shido	Wh-Why are you crying? Tell me.	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Um... Shido-san... *sniffle*

now... But at times like these...)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshinon. What happened?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, you see, Shido-kun... This is pretty\nbad."	
Message	None	"(Just as I suspected. The puppet's mouth
began to move.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshino doesn't like to talk to people, so
that's how Yoshinon came about. It's as if
Yoshinon's there to support her.)"	
Message	Shido	So what happened? Did you fall or something?	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's not it, Shido-kun! Nakamura-san...\nNakamura-san passed away from an accident!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wait...? Who?	
Message	Yoshino	*Sob*... In the drama.	
Message	Shido	Drama?	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right. It's a drama called\n'Endless Circle'. Nakamura-san is the main\ncharacter."	
Message	Shido	Oh, a drama... You scared me.	
Message	Yoshino	*Sob*... *sob*... Waaaaaaa...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Yoshino... Don't cry so much...	
Message	Yoshinon	"It's a big deal, Shido-kun! Nakamura-san was\nalmost about to get with Hanako-san! And then\nthis happens... It's horrible!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but... I-I didn't even watch that drama...	
Message	Yoshino	Naka...Naka...mura-san...	
Message	Shido	"Ahhh. Okay, okay I got it Yoshino. Just
stop crying."	
Message	Yoshino	*Sob*... *hiccup*... *Sniffle*...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What am I to do?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, Shido-kun, you just don't get it."	
Message	Shido	What is it, Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino is very sad right now. If you were her,\nwhat would you want someone to do?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Um... Leave me alone?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shut up!"	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Yoshinon	"You're totally wrong, Shido-kun! Yoshino\nwants someone to be nice to her and be by\nher side. Get it, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Yoshino	*Whimper*... *hiccup*	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay, Yoshino. Let's go in for now. We'll
drink warm tea and talk about it. I'll listen to
you until you feel better."	
Message	Yoshino	Waaa... Okay, Shido-san... Thank you.	
Message	Shido	*Sigh*...	
Message	None	"(As a result of running away from everyone
else, I had to deal with Yoshino in the end,
but...)"	
Message	None	"(Well... At least Yoshino is feeling better now.
I guess it all worked out.)"
