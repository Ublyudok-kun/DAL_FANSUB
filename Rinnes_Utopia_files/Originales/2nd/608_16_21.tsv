Message	Shido	Maria, let's go on a date.	
Message	Maria	"...Yes. Does this mean you will fulfill your
promise?"	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... I guess that's how things are
ending up. So, sure?"	
Message	Maria	It was worth it for you to owe me one.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about...?	
Message	Maria	It is a secret.	
Message	Shido	"Maria, I notice you've been smiling more
often."	
Message	Maria	Is it strange for me to express emotions?	
Message	Shido	"Now, that's not true. In fact, I think smiling
suits you well, Maria."	
Message	Maria	I-Is that so...? How embarrassing.	
Message	Shido	"It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Now then. Is there somewhere you'd like
to go?"	
Message	Maria	Somewhere I'd like to go...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Actually, even though it's a date, I can't
think of any place you'd want to go. Do you have
any suggestions, Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"I would enjoy taking my time to walk around
the city. Is that an adequate request?"	
Message	Shido	Is that all you want?	
Message	Maria	Yes. That is fine.	
Message	Shido	"Then, for now, why don't we take a walk around
the shopping district?"	
Message	Shido	"So you want to take a walk around the city,
huh? Well, this part's kind of nice, but it's
not exactly the real thing, is it?"	
Message	Maria	"Not exactly. However I haven't seen it for
myself, so the feeling is new."	
Message	Shido	"Really? But don't you know everything about
this world?"	
Message	Maria	"I know its informational make-up, but seeing
it for myself is a new experience."	
Message	Shido	Is that so? I don't get the difference.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. The buildings are larger up close, and
the streets are livelier."	
Message	None	"(As Maria spoke, she turned and looked
above us. It seemed like she was enjoying
herself. I've never seen Maria act this way.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'm sure it's hard to keep track of each and
every person who lives in this city, so for me,
it looks more deserted than usual."	
Message	Maria	Your world must be so lively, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it is. There are many, many more people.	
Message	Maria	I see... I hope to witness it first-hand.	
Message	Shido	That'd be―	
Message	Mana	Oh. It's you, Nii-sama.	
Message	Shido	Whoaaa. Mana?!	
Message	Mana	The hell are you doin' in a place like this?	
Message	Shido	Just taking a walk. Haha... Hahaha.	
Message	None	"(We're walking along the shopping district,
so the amount of familiar faces makes sense.
Why didn't I realize it sooner...?)"	
Message	Mana	So, who the hell is the girl next to you?	
Message	Mana	Is she your new, freakin' girlfriend?	
Message	Shido	"No no no. Maria's not my girlfriend!
We're just walking around because she
asked to."	
Message	Maria	Hrm...	
Message	Mana	"I see. So that's what it is. Jeez, you go through
girls quick, Nii-sama, that's why I'm so freakin'
worried."	
Message	Shido	You don't have to worry about that!	
Message	Maria	...Shido, let us go.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Hey, Maria... Wait up!	
Message	Shido	Sorry Mana, I'll see you later!	
Message	Mana	Ah, Nii-sama...?!	
Message	None	"(I spun around and chased after Maria, who
left in the middle of the conversation.)"	
Message	None	"(Her quick steps are a completely different
gait than how it was when she was enjoying
herself earlier. Maria's ignoring me now.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria. Wait up.	
Message	None	"(As I call to her to stop, she sulked, slowly
turning to face me.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido. Am I merely an acquaintance?	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's what we are to each other,
right?"	
Message	Maria	"Shido, you invited me on a date. Even then,
am I a mere acquaintance to you?"	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. Um. We're pretty close acquaintances,
I guess."	
Message	Maria	"That will do for the time being. However, right
now, we are on a date. Younger sister or not, I
cannot approve you being approached by women."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but she initiated the conversation, so it
couldn't be helped, right?"	
Message	Maria	...Even so.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Maria	"You need to understand women better,
Shido."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I get that a lot...	
Message	Maria	*sigh*...	
Message	None	(Hmm. What do I do...?)	
Choice		Apologize.	
Choice		Make an excuse.	
Message	Shido	"Maria, I'm sorry! I'll definitely be more careful
next time!"	
Message	None	"(I put my hands together, as if in prayer,
and lowered my head.)"	
Message	Maria	You must, all right?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, please forgive me. I mean it!	
Message	Maria	"There is no point in repeating myself,
so I will forgive you. However, in return..."	
Message	Shido	In return?	
Message	Maria	Please teach me... much, much more, Shido.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	"You don't really seem like the jealous type,
Maria."	
Message	Maria	"It is not jealousy. I was merely pointing out
your insincerity, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Either way, I only chatted with Mana for
a bit. Please cheer up."	
Message	Maria	I cannot. If you really insist, then...	
Message	Shido	If I insist?	
Message	Maria	Please teach me... much, much more, Shido.	
Message	Shido	I-I understand. I'll do my best.	
Message	None	(All right. Looks like Maria's feeling better.)	
Message	Maria	Now, let us continue our date.	
Message	Shido	Yes, let's.	
Message	None	"(After our conversation, we continued our
stroll.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido.	
Message	Shido	What's wrong?	
Message	None	"(Something piqued Maria's interest, and
she called out my name suddenly.)"	
Message	Maria	Those are our classmates.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's...?	
Message	None	"(What Maria had been pointing at was the
trio of Ai, Mai, and Mii.)"	
Message	Shido	"If they see us walking together... We'll be in
a lot of trouble."	
Message	Maria	"They will most certainly spread false rumors
about you."	
Message	Shido	"Most likely. Sorry, but we should probably
get out of sight."	
Message	Maria	"I understand. Then, I will leave this area
first."	
Message	Shido	No, you don't have to go that far.	
Message	Maria	It is much better this way. Is that okay?	
Message	Shido	All right, then. Sorry...	
Message	Maria	No, it is fine. For now, Shido. Good-bye.	
Message	None	"(For now, if I'm alone, then running into them
shouldn't be an issue. I'm worried about Maria,
but I'll just grab ingredients and head home.)"
