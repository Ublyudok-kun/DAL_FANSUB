Message	Tonomachi	Heeeey, Itsuka～.	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi?	
Message	Tonomachi	Here's the game I borrowed from you. Thanks.	
Message	Shido	Right. I had lent it to you. How was it?	
Message	Tonomachi	Sorry, but I actually stopped in the middle.	
Message	Shido	What? Was it boring?	
Message	Tonomachi	"No, it was great, but it lost some points with me
in terms of the female characters."	
Message	Shido	"Really? I thought the graphics were decently
good."	
Message	Tonomachi	"It's not that! It doesn't hit me right here!
Look around you, Itsuka!"	
Message	Shido	Around me?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Tohka-chan, Tobiichi, Tokisaki-san, Kotori-chan,
Yoshino-chan and Kaguya-chan and Yuzuru-chan
and Miku-tan! That's a first-class list, ya know?"	
Message	Tonomachi	You expect me to swoon from girls in a game?!	
Message	Shido	"Since you mentioned Tohka, she played this
game quite a bit, so it could be a conversation
starter. Not if you didn't finish it, though."	
Message	Tonomachi	"...Sorry, Itsuka. Let me borrow it one more
time. I'll head home and pull an all-nighter
to clear it."	
Message	Shido	Someone's delusional...
