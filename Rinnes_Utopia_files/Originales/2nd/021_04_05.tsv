Message	Shido	O-Oh, Kotori...!	
Message	Kotori	H-Hey, Shido. W-Welcome home...!	
Message	None	"(I didn't expect her to be there when I opened the
front door. Seeing her after what we just went
through is making me blush...)"	
Message	Kotori	U-Um, Shido...	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait, Kotori! Please, forget about earlier! That
was just a dream!"	
Message	Kotori	"I-I know that. And besides, I'm
embarrassed, too..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, are you...? You seemed to be so into being the
older sister..."	
Message	Kotori	"...If that's what you want, you can continue to be
Shiori for a while."	
Message	Shido	"*Grunt*... No, sorry, that was my bad. I'll forget
it if you will."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. As long as we're clear.
...So anyways, where's Arusu?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? She's not back yet?	
Message	Kotori	No, I thought you were with her.	
Message	Shido	"...Come to think of it, I was looking for Maria at
school and then... Sorry, Kotori. I'm going to go
back to school. She may still be there."	
Message	Kotori	W-Wait. I'll go with you.	
Message	None	"(And so we headed toward school. If she's not
coming home, we figured she forgot to do something
there.)"	
Message	Kotori	So what do you think?	
Message	Shido	About what?	
Message	Kotori	"""Don't ""about what"" me. Gosh... The thing about
teaching Arusu love. Have you made any progress?"""	
Message	Shido	"...That's the thing. I don't know if I'm able to
give her what she wants..."	
Message	Kotori	Yah!	
Message	Shido	Ouch! What the hell?!	
Message	Kotori	"Don't give me such a long face. Have more
confidence. If you're acting like that as the
teacher, there's no way she's going to learn."	
Message	Kotori	"If you don't know, be loud and proud about it. The
only things going for you are your drive and how
confident you can be with no talent, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Hey, that's rude.	
Message	Kotori	"I mean, you've come this far, right? I've been
watching you for a long time. I'm sure of it. So
you just follow through with what you believe in."	
Message	Shido	...You're right. Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"As long as you know, let's hurry up and find Arusu
so we can go home already."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Arusu!	
Message	Maria	Shido? So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Maria	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Shido	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Maria	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart
skips a beat, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, what are you doing, Shido?! Why are you stuck
to Arusu like that? Get a room already!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, Maria was...
You just told me you were cheering for me!"	
Message	Kotori	"Sh-Shut up! That's that. This is this!
Arusu, if you're done with what you're here for,
let's go home! You got it?"	
Message	Maria	Yes, understood.	
Message	Shido	Okay, Maria. Let's go home.	
Message	Maria	Okay.	
Message	Kotori	Here.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kotori	...You don't need me to explain, right?	
Message	Shido	Oh... Okay.	
Message	None	"(I held Kotori's hand with my right, and Maria's
hand with my left. As the three of us headed home,
I felt happy feeling like Maria was family.)"	
Message	None	"(...And so we continued to hold hands as we went
home.)"
