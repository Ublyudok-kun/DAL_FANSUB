Message	Shido	...*Gasp*!	
Message	Shido	What was I... doing right now?	
Message	Shido	I think... I was... Uh... That's right.	
Message	Shido	"I am... a producer for a new idol. We're pushing
sales at the shopping district."	
Message	Origami	Um... Mr. Producer...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami. Sorry, I was in a daze.	
Message	Origami	Are you tired...?	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm fine. It's a very important time for you
so I have to do a good job representing you."	
Message	Origami	Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. You're still new. We have to do our legwork.	
Message	Origami	U-Um... Producer? Um...	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Origami? Is there some kind of
issue?"	
Message	Origami	No... It's just, can I really be an idol?	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about? You're already a great
idol."	
Message	Origami	"...Y-Yeah. But... it's not that. Um, I want to be
more visible, and become someone that
youths aspire to be."	
Message	Shido	"Of course you can do that. Today we're just going
to go around the shopping district, but someday
you're going to fill the big stadiums."	
Message	Origami	...That sounds like a dream.	
Message	Shido	"Dream... That's right. A big dream. And we're
working hard now to make it come true. Right?"	
Message	Origami	Yeah.	
Message	Shido	"I like your answer. So let's do another good job
today."	
Message	Origami	"Okay... Producer. I'm sure you will take me
there... To the big stage."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, leave it to me. So let's change into today's
outfit."	
Message	Origami	Okay. Oh...	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?	
Message	Origami	Um, Mr. Producer? This outfit...	
Message	Shido	"Huh? It should fit you perfectly. Is there a hole
in it or something?"	
Message	Origami	"No. But this outfit... wouldn't you say it's a bit
too flashy for singing in a shopping district?"	
Message	Shido	"Flashy? Really? Well, I think idols can be a bit
flashy."	
Message	Origami	"Shid... I mean Mr. Producer... Do you like this
outfit?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm sure you'll look good in it, Origami.	
Message	Origami	I see. Then fine. I'll do my best wearing it.	
Message	Shido	"All right. Then let's get changed and go to the
shopping district. We'll do a live street
performance today."	
Message	None	(The concert started.)	
Message	None	(But no one is stopping to listen.)	
Message	None	(Hmm... This isn't good.)	
Message	None	"(What should I do? At this rate, no one's even
going to remember her name.)"	
Message	None	(Okay, we're going to need a strategy meeting.)	
Message	Shido	Origami, let's take a break.	
Message	Origami	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	You changed already?!	
Message	Shido	"Well, whatever... Anyways, we're doing a concert
and I wanted more people to stop and listen."	
Message	Origami	What should I do so more people will listen?	
Message	Shido	Hmm. Well...	
Choice		It's important to smile.	
Choice		Posing is important.	
Choice		Being problematic is important.	
Message	Shido	"What's important is to smile. I think your
expression is too stiff, Origami."	
Message	Origami	Smile... That's very difficult for me.	
Message	Shido	"You're an idol, Origami. You can't be saying
things like that. You want to have your big
break, right?"	
Message	Origami	Yes.	
Message	Shido	Okay, then.	
Message	Origami	"I want to become famous and have the tabloids
report suspicious relations with you, and then I
want to have a surprise wedding."	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh.... I think that's best left as a dream.
Yeah. Let's forget about the future. First
we need your smile to be softer."	
Message	Origami	How can my smile soften?	
Message	Shido	Hmm. Imagine something fun.	
Message	Origami	Something... fun?	
Message	Shido	"That's right. If you think of fun things,
it'll give you a natural smile."	
Message	Origami	Okay. I'll give it a try.	
Message	Shido	All right. Show me your smile.	
Message	Origami	*Pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... You're acting weird.	
Message	Origami	Shido... You can't do that... here... Ah...	
Message	Shido	STOP! STOPPPP!	
Message	Origami	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Weren't you acting a little crazy just now?	
Message	Origami	No. I was just imagining something fun.	
Message	Shido	Fun... That didn't sound right.	
Message	Origami	It was truly exciting.	
Message	Shido	"Well yeah, I guess excitement's a part of it,
but... Don't you have any fun that's more
heartwarming?"	
Message	Origami	I guess I understand the concept.	
Message	Shido	"No, you should know. Like, being on the big stage.
Imagine yourself fulfilling your dream. That kind
of stuff."	
Message	Origami	Okay. I'll give it a try.	
Message	Shido	All right, now smile for me.	
Message	Origami	Okay.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	...What do you think?	
Message	Shido	"What do you mean...? Don't tell me you were
smiling just now."	
Message	Origami	I was.	
Message	Shido	What?! It looked like your usual expression.	
Message	Origami	"That's not true. That was a 2 kilowatt smile.
Emotionally."	
Message	Shido	Hmm... Can you do it one more time?	
Message	Origami	It's a piece of cake.	
Message	Shido	...Are you smiling?	
Message	Origami	The biggest smile I have.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Origami	Is this not good?	
Message	Shido	"Hm. L-Let's hope for the best when you're up. Once
you start singing, your expression should soften.
You're good when it's the real thing, right?"	
Message	Origami	It'll be fine. No problem.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Then let's do it again.	
Message	Shido	"All right. There are more people here
than earlier."	
Message	None	(One more push.)	
Message	Shido	Origami, smile. Don't forget to smile.	
Message	Origami	L-Like this?	
Message	Shido	"Good job. You're able to smile.
That's cute, Origami."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. What an idol needs is a good pose. Let's come
up with something striking."	
Message	Origami	What should I do?	
Message	Shido	Hmm. Do you have any pose you're good at?	
Message	Origami	I actually do. The best one.	
Message	Shido	Nice. Then let me see it.	
Message	Origami	Okay. I'm a bit embarrassed but... watch.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh? You're going to sleep on the floor...?	
Message	Origami	My best pose...	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay... I don't think we can show
people that pose."	
Message	Origami	"I'm embarrassed, too... but if you tell me to do
it, I will."	
Message	Shido	No, okay. Um, let's stand for now.	
Message	Origami	You didn't like it?	
Message	Shido	"I think it's too avant-garde. Isn't there anything
else?"	
Message	Origami	Yes, but this one was the most appropriate.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, let's change it up, then! No posing! Let's
think of something else."	
Message	Origami	I see. Fine.	
Message	Shido	"If a pose isn't good, how about a catchphrase?
Something that stands out and shows your
characteristics."	
Message	Origami	So I should change how I talk?	
Message	Shido	"That's right. Why don't we start with something
easy and try to end on an interesting note?"	
Message	Origami	Like dis? I got dis.	
Message	Shido	Um... Hm... Dis, huh?	
Message	Origami	Is it not cute like dis?	
Message	Shido	"It's... super iffy... but maybe it could
be refreshing!"	
Message	Origami	You like this like dis?	
Message	Shido	All right, let's give it a go.	
Message	Origami	"E-Everyone. Thank you for gathering
around like dis..."	
Message	None	"(All right. Not many people around, but people
seem to like it.)"	
Message	Shido	"Good job, Origami. All you have to do is smile and
be friendly to the audience."	
Message	Origami	I-I got dis.	
Message	Shido	Good job. They're laughing.	
Message	None	"(Huh...? Are we supposed to have people laugh at
an idol concert?)"	
Message	None	(W-Well... I guess it's good enough for today.)	
Message	Shido	"Being a little problematic is important. Although
you're an idol, you shouldn't forget your heart as
a rocker."	
Message	Origami	Heart as a rocker?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. The rocker movement of going against the
societal norm. You're going to rebel against the
system and grip the hearts of youths everywhere."	
Message	Origami	"Roger. I'm going to read biker magazines, even
though I don't have my license yet."	
Message	Shido	Good good, that makes you so rebellious.	
Message	Origami	"I'm going to buy a wooden sword at my
school retreat."	
Message	Shido	All right, do more.	
Message	Origami	"I'm going to wear red and purple T-shirts under my
school uniform."	
Message	Shido	What a bad girl!	
Message	Origami	I'm going to sneak a butter knife into my pocket.	
Message	Shido	Crazy! Super crazy, Origami-san!	
Message	Origami	Am I going to get my big break?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, this is going to make you super popular...
Well, probably not..."	
Message	None	"(I was just going with the flow... but to be
honest, I feel like she's gotten a bit off-track.)"	
Message	Origami	"So... then I have no choice but to use my ace in
the hole."	
Message	Shido	You have an idea?	
Message	Origami	"A photo of me being caught going to a hotel with
my producer. I used photo-editing software to
make it. This is bad. Super tabloid-worthy."	
Message	Shido	Wait... That'll end your life as an idol.	
Message	Origami	"We can make it an established fact. It'll also
allow me to get married and quit."	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to do that! You're barely popular
still. You shouldn't be thinking of quitting yet."	
Message	Origami	Being put straight like this hurts my feelings.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry.	
Message	Origami	"But this isn't good. Then we have no other choice
but to work hard."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... how troublesome.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait... No, you should be working hard!
You're supposed to set the groundwork. That
in the end is the fastest way."	
Message	Origami	I see. Then I'm going to do my performance now.	
Message	Shido	Okay... yeah. That's the best way. Let's go.	
Message	None	"(*Sigh*... Looking around, we're slowly but surely
gathering an audience.)"	
Message	None	"(We're on the right track. Keep this up, and
someday you'll end up being a top idol, Origami.)"	
Message	Shido	"Good job, Origami. You're an idol, so remember to
smile."	
Message	Origami	Okay, Mr. Producer.	
Message	Shido	Good smile, Origami. Let's keep up the good work.	
Message	None	"(That's right. We've just started. We're going to
walk down the long, grueling path to stardom...!)"
