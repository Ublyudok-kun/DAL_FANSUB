Message	Shido	She's late...	
Message	None	"(I looked at my watch and muttered again for the
umpteenth time.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori!	
Message	Shido	"Are you ready yet? We need to go soon, or we won't
make it in time."	
Message	Kotori	Ahhh. Hold on, hold on～!	
Message	None	"(I heard her running all over the house. Eventually,
she jumped out with a travel bag.)"	
Message	Kotori	Sorry, sorry, Thanks for waiting, Shido! Let's go.	
Message	Shido	You sure took a long time. What were you doing?	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh. Girls have to get ready for a lot of things.
It's crass of you to ask that."	
Message	None	"(Kotori pouted a little, and her trademark ribbon
moved.)"	
Message	None	(It seems more pointed than usual.)	
Message	Shido	Kotori, you're really dressed up today.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, can you tell?	
Message	None	(Kotori twirled.)	
Message	Kotori	"Hehehe. I saved this for today. What do you think?
Do I look good?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it looks very good. You're cute as usual.	
Message	Kotori	Really? Hehehe.	
Message	None	(Kotori smiled. I could tell she was really happy.)	
Message	None	"(But yeah, she's actually really cute. She looks like a
fine lady heading off to a summer resort.)"	
Message	Kotori	I'm happy that you noticed, but I'm a bit shy.	
Message	Kotori	"Do you think I'm too giddy about it? Being all excited
like this?"	
Message	Shido	Why? Of course I wouldn't think that.	
Message	Shido	It makes me happy that you're excited.	
Message	Shido	"I mean, I was so excited that I couldn't even sleep
much last night."	
Message	Kotori	"Hehe. Shido, you're like a kid before a school trip.
I guess it makes sense why you overslept today."	
Message	Shido	"Shut up. You took so much time getting ready, so we're
even."	
Message	Kotori	Hehe... You're right. We are even.	
Message	None	"(If I'm going to travel with just Kotori, then of course
I'd be excited about it.)"	
Message	None	"(I was so excited last night that I couldn't sleep
and overslept this morning.)"	
Message	Kotori	"No matter how hard I tried to wake you, you wouldn't
budge. I didn't know what to do."	
Message	Shido	I said I'm sorry.	
Message	Kotori	"But it's all thanks to you that we can go on a trip
like this."	
Message	Shido	Well, I wouldn't say it's thanks to me.	
Message	None	"(Although Kotori and I are able to go out today, it
wasn't that easy.)"	
Message	None	"(Both Kotori and I are underage, so an overnight trip
required approvals.)"	
Message	None	"(Since our midterms were coming up, we could only get
approval if we got better grades.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori's at the top of her class, so she was fine. I
was another issue.)"	
Message	None	"(Every night, Kotori tutored me. Age-wise, it should
have gone the other way, but I don't like to mention
that.)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, and Kotori was hardcore in tutoring me...
Cramming? All nighters? Those are nothing.)"	
Message	None	"(Nothing compared to solving 100 variations of
formulas while standing on tippy-toe. Oh, and if you
got one wrong, you had to do a half-legged squat.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm surprised I survived...	
Message	Kotori	"But it trained your legs, right? And if your grades
also went up, that's even better."	
Message	None	"(Kotori snickered. Normally I would think she's a
brat, but I can't get mad at her for this.)"	
Message	Shido	"I guess it's thanks to you, Kotori... So I appreciate
your help."	
Message	None	(Although I couldn't walk for a while.)	
Message	Kotori	"It sounds like you don't mean it. But I'm glad you
worked hard, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I guess I should have studied on a regular
basis."	
Message	Kotori	"I know you worked hard for me, so that does honestly
make me happy."	
Message	Kotori	Thanks, Shido.	
Message	None	(That kinda tickles if she puts it that way.)	
Message	None	"(Anyways, we got the approval. So we are going to have
a blast.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's head out. Did you bring everything?	
Message	Kotori	"Hold on. Okay, so a change of clothes, snacks, a guide
book, and airplane tickets."	
Message	Kotori	Okay, we have everything.	
Message	None	"(Kotori took out an envelope with two tickets inside.
Looking at it like this, it's sinking in that we're
actually going on a trip.)"	
Message	Shido	Wouldn't it be nice if we could go more casually?	
Message	Kotori	Casually?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. For example, if we had a car, we wouldn't have
to buy any tickets, right?"	
Message	Shido	That's if we're going to go somewhere far like today.	
Message	Kotori	But I don't have my driver's license yet.	
Message	Shido	No, I can get it.	
Message	None	"(In a few years, I'll be able to get my license. It'll
be faster than waiting for Kotori to get hers, so I
want to do that much for her.)"	
Message	Shido	"If we had a car, we could go to so many places
casually."	
Message	Shido	"It'd be nice to go somewhere nearby and not have to
worry about anyone else while we're on the move.
Doesn't that sound fun?"	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	None	(Kotori's expression turned soft.)	
Message	Kotori	I like how you're so considerate. Kinda unexpected.	
Message	Shido	Unexpected? How rude.	
Message	Kotori	Yeah? Well then, let me rephrase it.	
Message	Kotori	I love you, Shido. I love you so much.	
Message	None	(To have her say it to my face made me blush.)	
Message	Shido	Me too, Kotori. I love you so much.	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. We'll be together always. Let's go on many more
trips together."	
Message	Shido	"Of course. There are still a lot of places and things
I want to do."	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. Like the southern islands, the hot springs, and
places within the country or abroad."	
Message	Kotori	Do you also want to do winter mountain climbing?	
Message	Shido	No, I was only kidding on that one.	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe.	
Message	Kotori	But... No matter where I go, it'll be with you, Shido.	
Message	None	"(Kotori wrapped her fingers around mine. Our eyes
locked.)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Kotori.	
Message	None	(We caught each other's eyes, and Kotori looked down.)	
Message	None	"(Our faces neared as naturally as if we were
breathing.)"	
Message	Shido	...Hey, I feel like I'm forgetting something.	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Oh, no...! The time!	
Message	Shido	Crap! Let's run, Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	Ah! H-Hey!	
Message	None	(I started running, dragging Kotori behind me.)	
Message	Kotori	Gosh! Why are we all over the place from the get-go?!	
Message	Shido	"It's because you took your time dressing up! I mean,
it is cute!"	
Message	Kotori	"It's because you overslept! But you did look cute
sleeping!"	
Message	None	"(Were we bickering or complimenting? We yapped at
each other as we ran.)"	
Message	None	"(If someone were just listening, it may have seemed
like we were fighting, but Kotori and I were smiling.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, Shido. Let's also make plans for the next trip,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. We're just starting the first one. You're
getting ahead of yourself."	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. We're going to plan the next one, and the
next one, and the ones for all eternity."	
Message	Kotori	"Of course you'll be coming with me on every single
one of them."	
Message	Shido	That's a big responsibility!	
Message	Kotori	Of course!	
Message	None	"(Kotori sped up and ran past me. Then she turned
around.)"	
Message	None	(Her smile was like a flower blooming.)	
Message	Kotori	Oh, and by the way, this isn't a command.	
Message	Shido	Then what is it?	
Message	Kotori	It's a favor. Can't you tell?	
Message	Shido	Right... From my adorable little sister―	
Message	Kotori	―What was that?	
Message	Shido	"A-A favor from my adorable girlfriend, right? Then of
course I'm going to have to accept."	
Message	Kotori	"Hehe. It seems like you'll go through anything with
me."	
Message	Shido	Well, that doesn't sound good...	
Message	Kotori	"From now on, I'll try my best not to order you around.
I'll ask. That way, you'll listen. Right?"	
Message	Shido	Gosh, what am I going to do with you... My girlfriend.	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. This is the kind of person your
girlfriend is. Do you hate me now?"	
Message	Shido	"Nope. I love you. So much I can't take it. Everything
about you, Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	"I love you too, Shido. From the bottom of my heart.
So please, be with me forever..."	
Message	Shido	"I guess I'm going to have to make that happen.
Kotori, I think I should ask you this, too. Be with me
forever."	
Message	Kotori	Okay!
