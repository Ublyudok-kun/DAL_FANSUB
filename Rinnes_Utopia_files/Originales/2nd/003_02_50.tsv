Message	Shido	"If I were to choose... I'd choose Kaguya and
Yuzuru, I guess."	
Message	Kaguya	"Well said, Shido, I knew you were the Knight I
approved!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Naturally. Shido belongs to Kaguya and Yuzuru.	
Message	Tohka	"Why did you choose the Yamais, Shido?! Is it
the food? They're bribing you with food, aren't
they?"	
Message	Shido	No, no, no, of course not!	
Message	Miku	"Whaaat, darling?! I know that Kaguya-san and
Yuzuru-san are cute, but... I want you to date
me today!"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, you're supposed to go out with me, your
girlfriend."	
Message	Shido	*grunt*... This isn't going anywhere.	
Message	None	"(I know! At a time like this... I'm going to have
to call the Fraxinus for help...)"	
Message	None	"(Whenever I run into issues, they always give me
some pointers or instructions. They should be
able to save me from this situation...!)"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you seem to be in trouble, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Perfect timing, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(My little sister Kotori is the Commander of the
Fraxinus. She should be a dependable advisor at
a time like this... I think.)"	
Message	Shido	Can you solve this problem for me?	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm. The girls in front of you, aside from\nOrigami, may possibly go berserk if you\nhurt them carelessly. You know that, right?"	
Message	Shido	I know that. That's why I'm struggling.	
Message	Kotori	"And you're going to choose the Yamai Sisters,\nknowing that?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. If I choose them, I can gain two people's
affections. I know it's not just about numbers,
but it's not the worst decision in all this chaos."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Well, surprisingly, it looks like you've\nthought it through for once. Then you do that.\nI'll handle the others."	
Message	Shido	Got it, thanks.	
Message	Shido	All right, Kaguya, Yuzuru! Let's run!	
Message	Yuzuru	Roger. We are escaping.	
Message	Kaguya	"Who are you talking to, Shido? Godspeed is
defined by me."	
Message	None	"(And so I ran off with the Yamai Sisters.
It was fine until...)"	
Message	Shido	You guys, can you give me more personal space?	
Message	Kaguya	"I can't accommodate that request. This volition
comes from the depths of the dark world.
Your fate is to be cursed."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Translating. Kaguya wants to stick to you and
doesn't want to part."	
Message	Shido	"I get it, but it's hard to walk. And Yuzuru, um...
don't rub up against me so much."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Offended. I cannot help it. Compared to Kaguya,
I am more voluptuous, I can't help it."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hey! Yuzuru, you're trying to subtly score
points! And you need to move away from him.
It's not fair how much more you have to touch!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Rebuttal. The distance between us is equal.
We must maintain fairness as Shido belongs to
both of us. This is just your personal issue."	
Message	Kaguya	"That's not fair! Then I'm going to push my body
up against him."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kaguya! Don't go forcing yourself on me.	
Message	Yuzuru	Advice. Shido, just give up.	
Message	Shido	No, but... Where are we going like this?	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh... Fear not, Shido. The wind will guide us
to our destination."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Translation. Kaguya is saying she hasn't really
decided on a place yet."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, got it. Let's just go to a café or
something. We can sit and rest..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. How about the café at the station over
there?"	
Message	Shido	"I'm telling you now, but... I don't have too
much money this month. So I won't be able to
pay for you guys."	
Message	Kaguya	"Foolish statement. I would never go against my
sister's suggestion. Besides, as long as I am
with you, I will go to hell and back. However..."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Kaguya	"Before that, you must fulfill a wish of ours.
You must go to the depths of Hades and
perform the secret ceremony."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Explaining. Shido, Kaguya wants to use the
restroom."	
Message	Shido	"That really sounded more complicated than
it was. I think there's a bathroom at the
station."	
Message	Kaguya	"Ahh... But at that rate, my seal will have
broken."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. Yuzuru will take care of Shido. So,
Kaguya, go to the bathroom or anywhere you
choose."	
Message	Kaguya	"I can't do that! While I'm away, you also
have to be separated from Shido."	
Message	Yuzuru	Rejection. Yuzuru has no reason to leave.	
Message	Kaguya	"Grr... Then I'm going to endure it. Yuzuru and
I are one. Until you leave, I vow to not leave
either."	
Message	Shido	No, no, you don't look fine at all, though.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Resolution. Shido and Yuzuru should go to the
bathroom with you."	
Message	Shido	I can't do that! Hey, what the—?! Don't pull me!	
Message	None	"(They somehow pushed me in front of the
bathroom, but...)"	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru went with Kaguya... No matter how
close they are, I hope they didn't get into the
same stall together...)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Reunited. Sorry for the wait, Shido.	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh, you're waiting there loyally. That's a good
mindset, my servant."	
Message	Shido	...You guys are really close.	
Message	Yuzuru	Of course. Kaguya and Yuzuru used to be one.	
Message	Kaguya	We're pretty much soulmates.	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, you guys are considered
sisters at school, but who's the older sister?"	
Message	Kaguya	Isn't it obvious? It would be Kaguya.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Foolish statement. It doesn't really matter, but
rather than the slender Kaguya, Yuzuru is
better fit as the older sister."	
Message	Kaguya	"O-Our physique shouldn't matter! Yuzuru,
you're still a child too."	
Message	Yuzuru	Declaration. It's the easiest way to tell.	
Message	Kaguya	Then let's battle to see who's the better fit.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. Let us battle to see who is more
like an older sister."	
Message	Shido	Hey, don't fight! It doesn't matter!	
Message	Kaguya	"Very well. If you say so, Shido. This can be a
draw in your favor. What do you say, Yuzuru?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Laugh. Are you running, Kaguya?	
Message	Shido	Stop! We're going to the café, aren't we?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Upset. Very well, that is more important right
now."	
Message	None	"(I'm glad it settled down. But I guess they still
might battle...)"
