Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Origami. Just as I thought, you're not always
holed up in the infirmary... right?"	
Message	Origami	"I don't know. But I do have memories of speaking
with you in the infirmary."	
Message	Origami	"And I found it natural that I was always in there.
But then my consciousness suddenly drew back
and I found myself standing here."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Origami	"I think what I experienced was different from a
dream... Maybe this being a virtual world has
something to do with it."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. But the scar I had earlier is gone...
How weird."	
Message	Origami	That is true. I'll look into this.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.
