Message	Shido	"The meaning of love is so complex,
don't you think?"	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, Shido. You'd better do a good job or else
we'll never get out of this world..."	
Message	Shido	"I know, but... Kotori, how would you answer? What
the meaning of love is."	
Message	Kotori	"Well... It'll be difficult to give the kind of
answer that Arusu wants. I mean, it's hard to
define to begin with."	
Message	Shido	"I know, right... If you think about it, neither of
us has really dated before. So it's hard to
feel... Oh."	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter? Did you think of something?	
Message	Shido	I wonder if a married person would know.	
Message	Kotori	"There's no way there's a married person here.
Jeez, you almost had me thinking you were onto
something."	
Message	Shido	"What about parents? I wonder what they'd answer if
you asked them... What is love?"	
Message	Kotori	I don't know. I mean, ours are barely home.	
Message	Shido	I know, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways, good luck to both of us. In the end,
this is the only way we know to get out."	
Message	None	(*Sigh*... This is going to be tough.)
