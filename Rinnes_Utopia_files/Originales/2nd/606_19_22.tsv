Message	None	"(Today, Kaguya and I are on our first official
date. She's pulling my arm as we walk through
town.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido, I wanna see that shop next! Oh,
take a look at those clothes!"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, wait a minute Kaguya! I'm coming,
so let go of my arm."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Sigh. At this rate, Shido's arm will rip from
its socket."	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru is trailing behind, looking a little
winded. I thought about choosing one over the
other, but it's okay for us to be all together.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Yuzuru, hurry up! Man, why are you guys
walking in the back? Pick up the pace."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Advice. This is no different from our previous
dates. Kaguya, he is your boyfriend, so you
should claim him and flirt with him more."	
Message	Shido	I'm okay... Whatever everyone wants.

nice to savor each day for what it was. To
spend it with someone you love.)"

okay?!"
