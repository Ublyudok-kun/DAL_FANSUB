Message	None	"(Some time had passed since Yuzuru and
I started dating. Today, we went to the
movies, and Kaguya joined us.)"	
Message	Shido	"I wanted to ask you about something. You
said that we couldn't hang out as a trio, but
now we're all together again, right?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. That is the case. I am the chosen
one. Today is our date, and there is nothing
wrong with that."	
Message	Shido	"If you say so, but... Kaguya, why are you
tagging along with us?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Well, Yuzuru practically begged me. She
wanted supervision on her first date."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. I asked Kaguya, and told her
I would like her to accompany me on my
first date."	
Message	Shido	"Argh. Okay, fine. What's the plan, then?
Any idea which movie we should watch?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Thinking. Kaguya, is there something you
prefer?"	
Message	Kaguya	You can be the one to pick, Yuzuru.	
Message	Shido	"Never mind... I'll decide. I'll pick something
both of you will like. That okay with you guys?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Of course. I look forward to it,
Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	Good job, Shido. You know us well.	
Message	None	"(Is it me, or does this feel more difficult than
before?)"	
Message	Shido	"It's almost time. Let's go inside. How should
we sit?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Answer. Kaguya, Shido, Yuzuru. How is that?	
Message	Kaguya	"No. Yuzuru, you're Shido's girlfriend. So it
should be me, Yuzuru, then Shido."	
Message	None	"(Watching their harmonious exchange made
me sigh in relief.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. Let us do this. Kaguya, you sit
on my lap, and Shido will sit beside us."	
Message	Shido	"You can't do that! Man, I'll decide how we
sit! Come on. It's starting!"	
Message	None	"(But it's all good. There's no rush while
we're in here. I couldn't be happier.)"
