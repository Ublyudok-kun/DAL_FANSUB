Message	Shido	What are you doing, Tonomachi?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Whoa! O-Oh. It's you, Itsuka. Don't scare me
like that."	
Message	Shido	"What are you doing behind this building?
Besides sneaking around and hiding."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Actually... This morning, there was a letter in
my shoebox."	
Message	Shido	What?! H-Hey, is that...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Shhh! Keep it down, Itsuka... That's right.
It's a love letter. There's no mistake."	
Message	Shido	Are you serious...?	
Message	None	"(I can't believe someone actually has a crush
on this guy...!)"	
Message	Shido	"So, did the mysterious sender ask you to meet
here? If so, why are you hiding?"	
Message	Tonomachi	No. I'm not certain if this is the meeting spot.	
Message	Shido	"Why? Isn't it in the letter? They said meet
behind this building, right?"	
Message	Tonomachi	When did I say it was addressed to me?	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	"It was someone in the class next to us who was
supposed to receive the letter. Actually, I don't
know his name. I just found the letter."	
Message	Shido	"So in other words, this has nothing to do with
you. You're snooping around random locations,
and hoping to find someone."	
Message	Tonomachi	That's correct.	
Message	Shido	This is low, even for you.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Shut up! I won't let ANYONE get in the way
of my happiness! Nothing can stop me...
No one can stop me."	
Message	Shido	Talk about bitter.	
Message	Tonomachi	"You wouldn't understand since you get to be
lovey-dovey with Tohka-chan!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, is that so? Hm... Someone's coming.	
Message	Tonomachi	Hrm! Someone's coming from that direction too!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tonomachi	...	
Message	Shido	They're both guys, huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	Yeah. Not something you see every day.	
Message	Shido	Should we head back...?	
Message	Tonomachi	...Yeah, we should.	
Message	None	"(We both quietly left our hiding spot. Though
I walked a meter behind Tonomachi.)"
