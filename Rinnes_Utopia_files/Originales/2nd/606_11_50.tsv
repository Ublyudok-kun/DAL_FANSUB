Message	Shido	"Mm...mm...? Was that the school bell? Crap... Did I
fall asleep?"	
Message	None	"(My memory is hazy. But I guess that means today was
peaceful enough.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, no point in staying here. I guess I can go
home now."	
Message	Shido	Oh, a text. Who could it be?	
Message	Kaguya	"You're late, Shido. How long do you plan on making
me wait? Swiftly make your way to the location where
we are to meet."	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya? Did we make plans together? Hmm... I don't
remember."	
Message	Shido	Whoa, another one. This time... it's from Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Verify. The location we are to meet is the rooftop.
Kaguya is getting tired of waiting, so I ask you that
you arrive quickly."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. Yuzuru is saying the same thing. I must have
completely forgotten. I guess I should go."	
Message	Kaguya	"You're late, Shido. You must not know your place,
making me wait like this... This time, I reluctantly
have come to pick you up. You'd best be thankful!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Waiting eagerly. We were waiting for you, Shido. Did
you have something to do?"	
Message	None	"(I bumped into Kaguya and Yuzuru on my way there.
Seems like they were heading my way.)"	
Message	Shido	My bad. I guess I fell asleep after class ended.	
Message	Kaguya	"This is hard to forgive, my servant. Having a siesta
while you make two unrivaled beauties wait... You
shall be cursed from the heavens!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Kaguya is right. I don't blame you if you were
tired, but I would like to see some effort from you as
our boyfriend."	
Message	Shido	...S-Sorry.	
Message	None	"(That's right. I'm currently dating Yuzuru and Kaguya.
Just as they suggested... I failed as a boyfriend for
making them wait.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"That's right, Shido. You'd best not tell me that your
siesta was so deep that it's thrown your memories
into the wilderness."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Verify. Kaguya and Yuzuru are your girlfriends. Have
you forgotten your promise?"	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, sorry. Seems like I was in a daze. Sorry for
not keeping my promise."	
Message	Kaguya	Hmph... So long as you know.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Smile. For Shido to be half asleep... It may rain
tomorrow."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, I said I'm sorry... Let me make it up to you
guys. I'll treat you out. Let's go somewhere. We can
do anything."	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Shido. A man will keep his word, right?	
Message	Yuzuru	Verify. You said anything, right? Then brace yourself.	
Message	Shido	W-Wait. I did say anything, but there is a limit!	
Message	None	(I mean, I don't have much cash on me...)	
Message	Kaguya	"You need not tell me. I know that. Hehe... But you
did say anything. Some creative thinking may be in
order..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Daydream. You said anything, so then I can...	
Message	Shido	"Do you guys really understand?! Seriously, go easy
on me!"	
Message	Shido	...Who would've thought it'd rain on us suddenly?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Surprised. I really didn't think it would actually
rain. Shido... your powers are scary."	
Message	Shido	"Um, that's not my fault... Do either of you have an
umbrella?"	
Message	Kaguya	"I didn't think it'd rain today, so of course I didn't
bring one."	
Message	Shido	"I thought so. I do have a spare umbrella, but I don't
think all three of us will fit under it."	
Message	Kaguya	"*gasp*...! Then of course you will be making a
decision under Yamai law."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. It appears a competition is in order. The
victor will get to walk under Shido's umbrella. The
loser will go home wet."	
Message	Kaguya	"A reward and a punishment. Very well. I will show you
my capabilities."	
Message	None	"(Ah, crap! At this rate, they're going to start their
battle. It's clear things are going to get heated.)"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, wait, you two. I thought we were going to go on
a date. Now isn't the time for this."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hm. You have a point, but... then what should we do?
There is only one umbrella."	
Message	Shido	Well, you have a point, but...	
Message	None	"(Man, it'll be difficult to borrow an umbrella from
someone. And... I don't want people to see two girls
serving me.)"	
Message	Shido	"I wonder if there's another way... I can't call for a
cab, and I feel bad asking Kotori to bring me an
umbrella."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. In that case, why don't you consider the
competition, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Me?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. You've done it before. Regardless, we
will need you to be the judge."	
Message	Kaguya	"I see. Impressive, Yuzuru. I'd say that is a good
idea. Shido, you must select a competition that is
stimulating and thrilling."	
Message	None	"(Stimulating and thrilling? I feel like they kinda
mean the same thing... But when they get like this,
I need to think of something or they won't budge.)"	
Message	Shido	"Heh. Very well.. If that's the case, then Shido Itsuka
will decide the competition between the Yamai Sisters!"	
Message	Kaguya	"You've awoken... Dear referee. It is your role to
facilitate the commencement of our holy battle!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Excited. I wonder what you will come up with.	
Message	Shido	"Silence, you two. I will be announcing it now. The
focus of the battle will be..."	
Message	Kaguya	*gulp*...	
Message	Yuzuru	Excited. I'm so curious...	
Message	Shido	Okay. Next it's your turn Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hm... Uh... C...C...
"	
Message	Kaguya	Oh! Caterpillar!	
Message	Yuzuru	Verify. Then. Insect.	
Message	Kaguya	"Another insect. Hmm... what can I think of... Gosh,
then this will be a strategic pass!"	
Message	Shido	"Unfortunately, Kaguya... You've passed three times
already so you can't pass anymore."	
Message	Yuzuru	Petition. Now you're next. It's your turn, Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	"GGRRRRR...! Shido, this isn't stimulating nor
thrilling! This is just a word association game!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. But look outside. Is there anything else we can
do that doesn't require much preparation and will end
quickly?"	
Message	Kaguya	Well, that's true, but...	
Message	Shido	"Then do you want to do Rock-Paper-Scissors? That'll
end quick."	
Message	Kaguya	No, that's too fast. I don't like it.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. Kaguya, it's your turn. It's pathetic watching
you trying to buy time like this."	
Message	Kaguya	"I-I'm not buying time! I was just looking for a noble
word befitting of the Yamai.
"	
Message	Kaguya	Oh... Yarn!	
Message	Yuzuru	Point. You just used that word earlier. Right, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Yes. You said it four words ago. I recorded it.	
Message	Kaguya	"*whimper* Yuzuru, it's so not fair that you keep
choosing the same category!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Sneer. Not fair? This is a tactic.	
Message	Kaguya	"*whimper* Why can't I use words that resonate in my
heart, like "blood seal"..."	
Message	Shido	Well, those are the rules. And blood seal...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. Blood has always been used to sign contracts.
"	
Message	Kaguya	Oh! Blood sugar!	
Message	Shido	Oh. Related to blood stream. You're good.	
Message	None	"(Well... I guess they're not words a high school
student should come up with. Kaguya seems to think
otherwise. I have a feeling the response will be...)"	
Message	Yuzuru	Easy. Then hot-blooded.	
Message	None	"(Seems like she was anticipating it. Yuzuru had a
response within two seconds. Kaguya, what are you
going to do now? There's no turning back.)"	
Message	Kaguya	I-I'm trying to think of a word. Hmm...	
Message	Kaguya	...WAHHHH! This is so wrong! I can't do it anymore.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Advice. Give it up, Kaguya. If you cry and ask for
forgiveness now, I will let you in the umbrella."	
Message	Kaguya	Grrr. Not yet...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Delight. You look so adorable when you're vexed. I
will allow you to think for a moment."	
Message	None	(They really are close.)	
Message	None	"(Because they're like that, maybe that's why it
doesn't feel as weird that the three of us are
dating.)"	
Message	None	"(But there are moments where I feel like I will have
to choose one or the other. But when that happens,
will I be able to choose? Either Kaguya or Yuzuru...?)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Ah, um... Hmm. OH!
"	
Message	Kaguya	Look, look! Shido, Yuzuru!	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	None	(Kaguya was pointing to...)	
Message	Yuzuru	Wonderment...	
Message	Shido	"Whoa. It seemed that the rain let up. It must have
just been passing by."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe, and now it will be no problem if we do not
have Shido's Regenschirm Umbrella."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Regenschirm is umbrella in German.
Umbrella is English."	
Message	Kaguya	"Sh-Shut up! I did that on purpose! It was just for
fun!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Doubt. Well, I guess I'll let you off the hook for
that. Anyways, it seems like it won't rain again for a
while. What were the results of the battle...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, there's nothing to bet on anymore, so why don't
we just call it a draw?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Sigh. Very well. I couldn't drive her into a corner. I
was close."	
Message	Kaguya	"YAY!
"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Yuzuru, you got lucky. I had prepared a word
of despair that would have annihilated you..."	
Message	Shido	"Then Kaguya, we can continue just a little longer,
if you wish? Let's settle the score."	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh! The sunset is calling me! Let's go, Shido, Yuzuru.
We must run like the wind."	
Message	Shido	Haha. She ran for it.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. She ran. Kaguya running with her tail wagging
like that is so cute."	
Message	Kaguya	Hurry up, you two! We won't have time for our date!	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Wait, Kaguya. I'm on my way.	
Message	None	"(Hearing Kaguya's voice, Yuzuru immediately moved
toward her. Before I knew it, they were already
walking together, side-by-side.)"	
Message	Shido	Gosh, I never get bored when I'm with you two.	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, hurry up! You might miss curfew.	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Hehe... Let's go, Shido.	
Message	Shido	I'm on my way!	
Message	None	(And so I walked, but...)	
Message	None	"(Because of the rain, there were puddles
everywhere...)"	
Message	None	"(Whoa, something inappropriate is showing in the
puddles. Do you guys not notice?!)"	
Message	Kaguya	What is the matter, Shido? Hurry!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Doubt. Is something the matter, Shido? Do you need
to say anything?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well no, that's not it. Actually, you guys should
look down..."	
Message	Kaguya	Huh...? AH!	
Message	Yuzuru	Understood. Shido, why didn't you warn us?	
Message	Shido	"N-No, I didn't see anything. If you understand now,
hurry up and go."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... What are you embarrassed over? We are dating.
This is not a big deal."	
Message	Shido	Wha...?	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. If you'd like, you can see it yourself directly.	
Message	Shido	D-Don't be a fool! I'm going ahead of you guys!	
Message	Kaguya	Hey wait, Shido. Don't leave us behind!	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Please wait for us, Shido.	
Message	None	"(And so our love life continues. But honestly, I feel
like nothing much has changed from the time before
we started dating.)"	
Message	Kaguya	What's the matter, Shido? You seem deep in thought.	
Message	Shido	Does it seem that way?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Yuzuru thinks so, too. You seemed to have
something on your mind before we left school."	
Message	Shido	"You guys see right through me, huh? Well, I was
thinking about something."	
Message	Kaguya	Which is?	
Message	Shido	"Are you two happy being with me? I mean, I've never
dated two girls at the same time, so I don't get it."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, I enjoy spending time with just the three of
us, but it's kind of the same as before. So I was
wondering if you were satisfied with everything."	
Message	Kaguya	I see. You were worried about that, huh?	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I know it kinda sounds pathetic.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Deny. That is not true. I am very happy to hear you
worry for us. However..."	
Message	Kaguya	"We are very happy to be with you, Shido. Today,
tomorrow, and the day after. I always want us to be
together. Therefore... Shido, you must not worry."	
Message	Shido	Kaguya, Yuzuru... I see. Got it. Thanks you two.	
Message	Kaguya	"H-Hmph. If there's something you're worried about,
you can ask us anything. I mean we're..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. We are dating.	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, I was going to say that!	
Message	Yuzuru	Supremacy. First come, first served.	
Message	Kaguya	"Let me ask you. Shido, um... is it fun for you? Dating
us..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Question. Yuzuru wants to know, too. Shido, is this
relationship painful for you?"	
Choice		It's fun. That's for sure.	
Choice		Honestly, I don't really know.	
Message	Shido	"It's fun. That I can say for sure. If not, then I
wouldn't have chosen you two."	
Message	Shido	"But you're right. I'm lucky that this is what I'm
stressed about."	
Message	Kaguya	That's not true. I'm glad you told us.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Yuzuru, too. If you're worried about anything,
we want to think it through with you."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. That makes me happy, but...	
Message	Shido	When you guys put it that way, it makes me blush.	
Message	Kaguya	Y-You fool. We're just as embarrassed.	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. You two are bright red.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about? So are you, Yuzuru.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... You've made a mistake, Yuzuru. That makes
you super cute!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. I guess that is the case.	
Message	Shido	To be quite honest, I don't know.	
Message	Kaguya	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't want to
be with you guys anymore."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. Because you're dating us, you're just
worried about our relationship."	
Message	Kaguya	I see... I guess that makes sense.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Doubt. Kaguya, do you really understand? This is a
relationship between a man and woman."	
Message	Kaguya	H-How rude. I know that much. I-I read a lot of manga.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Scorn. Read a lot of manga... You must not conflate
fiction with reality, Kaguya."	
Message	Kaguya	Y-You don't have much experience either, Yuzuru!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Rebuttal. That is not true for Yuzuru. I have much
experience."	
Message	Kaguya	"That was such a lie that I don't even know where to
begin."	
Message	Shido	Pff. Ahahaha...	
Message	Kaguya	Shido...? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Thanks, you two. For worrying about me.	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. I have no idea what you're talking about.	
Message	Kaguya	Me, neither. I didn't mean it like that.	
Message	Shido	"Haha, right. Sorry for bringing this up while we're on
a date. Thank you, though..."	
Message	Kaguya	"N-No need to thank us. You can show your appreciation
through your actions."	
Message	Yuzuru	Return. You're welcome. Let's get going.	
Message	None	"(After having the two hear me out, I felt a little
better.)"	
Message	Shido	"Thanks, you two. Now let's get going. You wanted to
go somewhere, right?"	
Message	Kaguya	"I am looking for a writing implement that stores
the god of education..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Idea. Yuzuru wants to go to a café.	
Message	Shido	"So the supply store and a café... Got it. I'll go
anywhere with you two."	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, come to think of it... You were going to buy us
something, weren't you?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. You were going to treat us.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I guess we'll take turns.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hahaaa. I see, I see. Let's see what I should have you
gift me."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Pending question. It seems like we will need your
wallet to make an appearance."	
Message	Shido	Seriously, guys. Go easy on me!	
Message	Kaguya	What... did you say?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Guess. You knew that this was going to happen,
didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	Well, not exactly, but...	
Message	None	"(Dating them is a challenge, but so much happens
that it's fun. During times like these, though... it's
pretty tough on my wallet...)"	
Message	Shido	I guess I'll have to man up. *sigh*...
