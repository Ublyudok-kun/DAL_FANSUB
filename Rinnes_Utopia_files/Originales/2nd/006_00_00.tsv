Message	???	...What is love?	
Message	Shido	L-Love? Hmmmm... Love, huh?	
Message	None	"(It's such an abstract question out of the blue.
How should I answer?)"	
Message	None	"(Normally Kotori or Reine-san would give me a
command here, but... they're not giving me
anything.)"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, is it this hard for me to
communicate in the real world? Well, it's not like
I'm talking to a Spirit right now, but...)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm... Love... What is love...?	
Message	???	"...What kind of thing is love? I don't know.
So I want to know."	
Message	Shido	Uhh, hm... Why do you want to know so much?	
Message	???	I wonder why...?	
Message	Shido	Um, don't ask me...	
Message	???	"But I want to know... That's what I think. That's
all I want to know in this world—just love."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	None	"(The only thing in this world... That's
real intense. Who is this girl?)"	
Message	???	"What is love...? What does it point to?
I need to know."	
Message	???	"Or else, I won't be complete. I won't be able to
fulfill my role. So... I want to know love."	
Message	Shido	"That sounds pretty serious...
Love, hm... love..."	
Message	???	Shido Itsuka, do you not know what love is?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I know what the word means. But it's hard to
explain. And how do you know my name...?"	
Message	???	I know everything in this world.	
Message	None	(Everything... Hm? Wait...)	
Message	Shido	Oh, are you like a navigation NPC or something?	
Message	None	"(Then it would make sense that I wouldn't have
recognized her. But it's a mystery that Reine-san
didn't know about it, either...)"	
Message	???	Navigation... Is that... my role?	
Message	Shido	Hm? You don't know?	
Message	???	"I wasn't given a role... All I know is one thing.
That I need to know what love is... That is all."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... Then what about your name? What's your
name?"	
Message	???	Name... My name... is...	
Message	None	(She's deep in thought.)	
Message	???	...Arusu. My name matches outside data.	
Message	Shido	"Nice to meet you, Arusu. That sounds really
unique. Is that your last name? Or your first
name?"	
Message	Arusu	"I... do not know. I just know that I am Arusu...
The data tells me so."	
Message	Shido	I see. Then I'll call you Arusu.	
Message	Arusu	"Okay, it's nice to meet you. So, Shido Itsuka...
Please teach me what love is."	
Message	Shido	So, we've come back to that topic.	
Message	None	"(Do I have to answer this? I'm not getting any
instructions from Kotori or Reine-san...)"	
Message	Shido	Kotori, Reine-san... Can you hear me?	
Message	None	(...They're not answering.)	
Message	Arusu	Can you tell me what you think love is?	
Message	Shido	"Hm... Well... Love is finding someone precious or
dear to you..."	
Message	Arusu	"So if you find them precious, is it love? Then do
you love the flower that you water every day?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, that's... different... Kind of. Well
actually, I guess it is different."	
Message	Arusu	"So if you find them precious, is it love? Then,
Shido Itsuka... Do you love money? You're
always trying to save money every month."	
Message	Shido	How do you know that?!	
Message	Shido	"A-Anyways... Money is important... but I guess I
don't love it..."	
Message	None	"(When she asks me stuff like this, it makes me
lose my confidence.)"	
Message	Arusu	Even if you find it precious, you don't love it.	
Message	Arusu	"It seems to be contradicting what you stated
earlier, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Well... that's true, but...	
Message	Shido	"There are so many different forms of love. I mean,
there's romance, there's love for your neighbors,
familial love. Family..."	
Message	Shido	"You want to protect that person. Or you would do
anything for that person... That type of feeling,
I guess?"	
Message	Arusu	...You were saying many things just now.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I was, but...	
Message	None	"(When I thought of family, I thought of Kotori.
But if my little sister heard me say I'd do
anything for her, God knows what she'd ask of me.)"	
Message	Arusu	"Then if you had a leash put on you, and someone
asked if they could step on you, would you comply
with them out of love?"	
Message	Shido	"Where did that come from?! N-No, I mean, it's not
like I'm judging that kind of love, but...?!"	
Message	None	"(She's right. I was just thinking about what I
would do for Kotori, but for some reason I
suddenly remembered Kannazuki-san just now...)"	
Message	Arusu	"You won't judge... Then, being stepped on...
is also love."	
Message	Shido	No, no, wait a minute.	
Message	Arusu	Waiting is also love, then?	
Message	Shido	"Uh, it's not like that. And why did you bring up
being stepped on..."	
Message	Arusu	"When you mentioned family, it was a result of what
I predicted, based on Kotori Itsuka's actions."	
Message	Shido	"Right... I see. Well, um... I apologize as her
brother."	
Message	Arusu	Huh...?	
Message	Arusu	"If you claim they are both wrong... What is love
for you, Shido Itsuka?"	
Message	Shido	Hmm....	
Message	Shido	"For example, if you think of them, your heart
feels happy or full of joy..."	
Message	None	"(I kind of thought about Tohka
as I answered that.)"	
Message	Arusu	Heart becomes happy or full of joy...	
Message	Arusu	"Then... If your dinner is curry, Tohka Yatogami
becomes happy and starts to hum. Does that mean
she loves curry?"	
Message	Shido	"I wouldn't be surprised if she did! But... I guess
you could say that about her and all different
kinds of food."	
Message	Arusu	So is it different from love?	
Message	Shido	"I wonder... It's true that the term "love" can be
used for money and food..."	
Message	Shido	"...But when used with a person, it just feels
different."	
Message	Arusu	So, loving a human is different?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Food, sports, hobbies... Loving these things
is a bit different."	
Message	Arusu	"I see. Then I... want to know what love is toward
humans."	
Message	Shido	Uh... Why is that?	
Message	Arusu	"Of all the information of love that I have
recorded, that is the only uncertain thing.
That is why I want you to teach me what love is."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I had a feeling you'd say that... Hm...
Maybe it's the feeling of having compassion
for someone..."	
Message	Arusu	"Compassion and love... Do they mean the same
thing?"	
Message	Shido	Oof... O-Oh. Well... I guess... uh...	
Message	Shido	"Gosh, I'm so sorry, Arusu. I guess I don't know
how to explain it."	
Message	Arusu	...Putting "love" into words is hard.	
Message	Arusu	"If that is the case... Then we shall simulate the
growth of this form of love... That way, I may
find an answer."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean by that?	
Message	Arusu	"I need appropriate materials to formulate love
with Shido Itsuka. Initializing search..."	
Message	None	(Search...? What does she mean by that...?)	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Arusu	Search complete. Making contact now.
