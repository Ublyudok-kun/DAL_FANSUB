Message	Shido	Origami... You seem pretty well-adjusted.	
Message	Origami	"Rather than fighting, we need to cooperate right
now. The nature of this situation is not lost on
me."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Origami. What do you think we can do to get
out of this world? Is there a good way to explain
what love is to her?"	
Message	Origami	"Accept everything about Shido wholeheartedly.
That is love."	
Message	Shido	"Th-That only goes for you, right? That's a little
different from love in general..."	
Message	Origami	"That's not true. If you accept all of me in
return, then we should be able to show
her what love is."	
Message	Shido	No, no, no, no! That's going way too far!	
Message	Origami	Think about it. I am ready for you anytime.	
Message	None	(...I will leave her be for now.)
