Message	Shido	Uh, so where were we heading again?	
Message	Reine	Hey, Shin.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Reine-sensei... What are you doing here?	
Message	Reine	"...What do you mean by that, Shin? I came to pick
you up."	
Message	Shido	"Pick me up... Reine-sensei, aren't you in charge
of the girls' health checkups?"	
Message	Reine	"...That was the plan, but something came up, so I
have to leave soon. I'll leave the rest to you,
Shin."	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Leave it to me?	
Message	Reine	"...It's mostly done, but... There was one girl who
was late. I still have her left."	
Message	Shido	"I don't really get what's happening, but... don't
tell me... I have to do the health checkup...?"	
Message	Reine	...Of course you do.	
Message	Shido	What?! But why me?	
Message	Reine	"...Isn't it obvious? That's what assistants do,
Shin."	
Message	Shido	"...Excuse me? O-Oh, my God... you're right! I'm
wearing a lab coat!"	
Message	Reine	"...You can't escape your responsibilities, Shin.
You have to do your work."	
Message	Shido	I see... So I'm a doctor...	
Message	Reine	Well then, I'm leaving the rest to you... 	
Message	Shido	Hey... Reine-sensei!	
Message	Shido	...And she's gone.	
Message	Shido	I wonder who missed their checkup...	
Message	Shido	I guess I have no choice but to go...	
Message	Shido	So, I'm going to do the physical here...	
Message	Shido	A... physical... for a girl...	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(No, no. I'm a doctor. I shouldn't have any
ulterior motives.)"	
Message	Shido	Stay calm. Stay calm.	
Message	Tohka	Sorry for the wait!	
Message	Shido	Wh-Whoa! Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	"Ohhh, Shido! Are you going to do my physical?
That's amazing! I'll be counting on you."	
Message	Shido	"Then that means... you're the student that was
late?"	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah! I was waiting at the school because I
thought they'd be testing how fast we could
run or throw a ball, but no one came."	
Message	Shido	Why didn't anyone tell her?!	
Message	None	(If no one noticed, I wonder who set this up.)	
Message	Shido	Well, what I'm going to do is examine your body.	
Message	None	"(Ngh... Calm down. Calm down, Shido! Be cool, be
cool...!)"	
Message	Tohka	Hey, Shido? What do you examine in a physical?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well... I'll be measuring your height and your
weight. It's not a big deal. There's nothing
suspicious about it."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, is that all? Let's hurry up and finish it,
then."	
Message	Shido	R-Right. Let's get this over with.	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. So we've finished measuring your height
and weight. Umm... so your height is 155 cm, and
your weight is..."	
Message	Tohka	Hey, wait a minute, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Tohka	"You're not supposed to expose a girl's weight...
That is an expectation upheld by society."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see... You're right. I don't know who told
you that, but I guess I shouldn't be saying it
out loud, huh?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! Shido, you're amazing!	
Message	Shido	"I don't about that... but I'll be quiet while
I write it down."	
Message	Tohka	So, what are you going to measure next? My grip?	
Message	Shido	Ngh... Hm. Well, what's next is, um...	
Message	Tohka	"What's the matter, Shido? Are you not able to read
what's on the paper?"	
Message	Shido	No... Of course that's not it!	
Message	Tohka	Hehe. It happens to me all the time.	
Message	Shido	"Don't be proud of that... Well... what I have to
do is take your measurements."	
Message	Tohka	"M-Measurements? Are you talking about... those
areas?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I am...	
Choice		Bust, waist, hips.	
Choice		Physical aptitude, intelligence, agility.	
Choice		Regular, large, extra large.	
Message	Shido	"I'm talking about your bust, waist, and hip
measurements."	
Message	Tohka	"I-I see. I know about that. I've done it before.
B-But... it's my first time... having you measure
me."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... S-So, I'm going to have to... at least
touch... your body a little."	
Message	Tohka	You're... going to touch me?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. You have problem with it, huh? If you
don't want me to, I can ask someone else to
do it..."	
Message	Tohka	I-I don't... mind.	
Message	Shido	R-Really...?	
Message	Tohka	"B-But... it is a physical. So... you're not doing
it with ulterior motives, right? I don't want
you... to get the wrong idea."	
Message	Shido	No, that's... That's not it...	
Message	Tohka	"A-Anyways... if it's you, I don't mind! So long as
it's you, Shido... I, um... don't mind if you
do... anything..."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Okay. Th-Then let's get started.	
Message	Shido	"I'm talking about physical aptitude, intelligence,
and agility."	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What? I understand the physical part and maybe
agility... but intelligence...? Wh-What's that?"	
Message	Shido	Ah... that'll be 32.	
Message	Tohka	"What?! You're writing it down already?! But you
didn't even measure anything."	
Message	Shido	"That was just a joke. I need to measure
your figure."	
Message	Tohka	"Y-Yeah. You're talking about bust, waist, and
hips, right? But I've already done that before."	
Message	Shido	"These are things we measure periodically. It could
have changed, you know?"	
Message	Tohka	"I-Is that so? I'm not a rubber doll. I don't think
I'll grow or shrink all the time."	
Message	None	"(It's true. No matter how much Tohka eats, her
figure doesn't change. If other girls heard that,
they might get jealous.)"	
Message	Tohka	"D-Don't tell me, Shido... That you're saying that
only because you want to touch me."	
Message	Shido	"O-Of course not. I'm a doctor. Th-This is
necessary for your health."	
Message	Tohka	I see. You are a doctor. I trust you.	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay, leave it to me. Anyways, let's
get measuring."	
Message	Shido	"I'm talking about regular, large, or extra large.
What do you want, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What? I can only choose one?
That's troublesome..."	
Message	Shido	I'm fine with regular.	
Message	Tohka	"Ngh... fine, I guess I'll be happy with an extra
large. It better come with miso soup."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it usually does... What are you talking
about?! That's not it! I'm talking about your
figure! Your figure! Bust, waist, and hips!"	
Message	Tohka	What?! So, no miso soup?!	
Message	Shido	"No! How long would you have gone along with that,
Tohka...? Let's hurry up and get your
measurements."	
Message	Tohka	Huh? Wait, you're not talking about food?	
Message	Shido	"I'm talking about your physical. I was just
kidding earlier."	
Message	Tohka	"I see. It was a joke... But... grr... now that you
bring it up, I'm getting hungry."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Well, I'm sorry about that. How's this...
I will buy you a beef bowl on our way back."	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh, a beef bowl! That would be nice! All right,
let's hurry and finish this."	
Message	Shido	...There's something you need to do before that.	
Message	Tohka	What are you doing? Why did you stand up?	
Message	Shido	Oh, I forgot to check you with the stethoscope...	
Message	Tohka	Oh, then let's do that first.	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, if I do it from the front, it
would be kinda embarrassing... Can it be from the
back?"	
Message	Tohka	That's fine! You're a doctor. I trust you!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Okay. I am a doctor, after all.	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	None	(But that isn't a good enough reason.)	
Message	Shido	It's just... Are you okay with that, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Huh? I don't mind at all.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Then...	
Message	Shido	I-Is this it...?	
Message	Tohka	...Hah...mmm...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... don't make weird noises.	
Message	Tohka	S-Sorry. I was surprised.	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. I see. Sorry about that. Well... this
is... *grunt*..."	
Message	None	(I'm totally... touching Tohka's body.)	
Message	None	"(Tohka's warmth, my hand grazing her skin... and I
can feel her soft hair... there's the scent of
soap...!)"	
Message	None	(Oh, no... I'm feeling dizzy.)	
Message	Tohka	"What's the matter, Shido? You're not going to
measure me?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I will. I-I'll do it now.	
Message	Tohka	"Y-You're breathing very heavily, Shido.
Are you sick?"	
Message	Shido	N-No... It's nothing.	
Message	None	"(Oh, no... I guess my excitement was obvious from
my breathing. I should hurry through this as
quickly as possible.)"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, Tohka. Let's get this over with.	
Message	Tohka	B-Bring it on!	
Message	Tohka	Haah... Kyaaa.	
Message	Shido	"*Grunt*... Don't move, Tohka. I can't measure you
like this."	
Message	Tohka	*Whimper*... I-It tickles. It tickles, Shido!	
Message	Shido	I'll be done quick. Hang in there...	
Message	Tohka	Ah... Ahh... Mmm.	
Message	Shido	D-Don't twist your body...	
Message	Tohka	Un...mm... Ah... Ahhhh.	
Message	Tohka	Ah...ahhh...mm... Ah...	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido. My body is getting hot...	
Message	Shido	Don't move! I can't hear!	
Message	Tohka	N-No...! I-If you touch me there...	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, calm down! This is a physical. Don't make
noises or move..."	
Message	Tamae	Excuse me.	
Message	Tamae	"Is the physical over?
"	
Message	Tamae	"I've come to help you clean up.
"	
Message	Tamae	...Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh?!	
Message	Shido	Ah...?!	
Message	Tohka	"...*pant*... *pant*... Shido... I-I can't... take
it anymore..."	
Message	Tamae	"Itsuka-sensei! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you
doing?! T-T-T-T-To our student?! Ahhh! This is
inappropriate!"	
Message	Shido	N-No! It's not like that!	
Message	Tamae	PERVERT! PERRRRVERT IN THE BUILDING! SOMEONE!	
Message	Tohka	What... pervert? Who is she talking about?	
Message	Shido	C-Crap! Aaaaaaggghhhhh!
