Message	Reine	Sorry for calling you here, Shin...	
Message	Shido	"That's fine... But if you called everyone else,
why didn't you say so?"	
Message	Reine	Oh, sorry. I forg—	
Message	Shido	Reine-san?	
Message	Reine	I wanted to surprise you.	
Message	Shido	No, you totally forgot to tell me, didn't you?	
Message	Reine	Of course not. Right, everyone?	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Reine-san called us because she said we'd\nsee something fun!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... The fact that you've called me here
must mean you've prepared an offering."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. I am hungry, so let us hurry up and
get this over with."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, let's go to dinner after this～ I found a
really nice Japanese restaurant."	
Message	Shido	"I-It's pretty crazy to see everyone gathered
here..."	
Message	Shido	"We're going to play a game, right? Judging by
the number of people, is it a party game?"	
Message	Tohka	"Geme"? We were called to play this thing\ncalled "geme"?	
Message	Reine	"Well, yes. I've told Shin a little about it, but
this is the launch party for Ratatoskr's new game,
"My Little Shido 2"."	
Message	Shido	"Launch party... If we're just going to play the
game... why did it have to be at the Fraxinus?"	
Message	Kotori	Well there's a reason for that.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"This time, "My Little Shido 2" is a
super-simulated reality love game."	
Message	Shido	Super... simulated... what?	
Message	Kotori	"Simulated. If you mess it up, I will step on
you."	
Message	Shido	Where?!	
Message	Kotori	Anyways, basically it's a virtual reality game.	
Message	Kotori	"That's why we need the Fraxinus's super
computer to run it."	
Message	Shido	"A super computer to play a gal game... I feel
like it's a complete waste of the best
technology ever..."	
Message	Reine	"It's not just a gal game, Shin. This game has
completely recreated Tengu City to allow you
to transfer your consciousness to another world."	
Message	Shido	"Just hearing that sounds interesting, but I'm
already worried..."	
Message	Kotori	"You see, things like these need to actually be
played for us to gain a complete understanding.
That's why we've invited you to test it."	
Message	Shido	So basically we're guinea pigs.	
Message	Kotori	"Stop complaining or I'll make you a dog in the
VR world."	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I'd rather you not...	
Message	Shido	Man, this is some equipment...	
Message	Reine	"Yeah. This is a room designated for "My Little
Shido 2" and we've expanded the facility just
for that."	
Message	Shido	"This is the only time you've really sunk all your
effort into something."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, let's start and have you sit there, Shido.
Reine will configure the settings, so just
relax."	
Message	Reine	Well, it's just a game. Don't be so nervous.	
Message	Tohka	"So what should we do? I want to play with
Shido! "Geme" with Shido!"	
Message	Reine	"Sorry, Tohka, but this game is for one person.
I can't have individual devices run on their
own."	
Message	Tohka	Wh...at...?	
Message	Shido	"But there are a lot of machines here. Besides,
if it's a single-player game, why did you call
everyone here?"	
Message	Reine	"I wanted to show everyone how moe'd up you
would get playing a gal game."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no, that makes no sense! This is all
just to make a spectacle out of me!"	
Message	Reine	That is... not true.	
Message	Shido	"Why did you pause for a second just now?
Huh?!"	
Message	Miku	"Hm, I do want to see my darling become moe.
Hehe. I'm sure it'll be adorable～"	
Message	Yoshino	I too... want to see.	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's true. How often do we get to see that?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hm... Our Shido's embarrassment is something
worth ingraining into the soul!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Let's burn it into our memories.	
Message	Shido	You guys, can you—	
Message	Kotori	"Okay, okay, stop flirting and let's get you
started."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"(I still don't get what's going on, but I guess
they just want me to play it.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I'm going to forget that everyone is
watching. It's not like the original "My Little
Shido" wasn't crazy in its own right.)"	
Message	Shido	Uh... So what should we do?	
Message	Reine	"Hm... You stay put. Hm... okay.
Now I'll connect you."	
Message	None	"(Reine-san mentioned earlier that my
consciousness would be transferred. I wonder
how it's going to be. I can't even picture it.)"	
Message	Reine	Hm...? What the...?	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter, Reine?	
Message	Reine	"Hm... The system seems to be normal.
I guess it's my imagination. Now, let's start."	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	None	(Huh? Was I sleeping just now...?)	
Message	Shido	I'm at home, right? Uh... Maybe I was in a daze.	
Message	Shido	Hmm, did I have a weird dream...?	
Message	None	"(I feel strange, but I know for sure I was at
home.)"	
Message	Shido	I guess I'll start making dinner...	
Message	Kotori	"What are you talking about?"	
Message	Shido	Huh, Kotori...?	
Message	None	(I hear her voice clearly, but I don't see her.)	
Message	Shido	"What the...? Where is her voice coming from?
I don't even have a transmitter on."	
Message	Kotori	"..."	
Message	None	(Silence. That's rare for Kotori.)	
Message	Kotori	"I'm communicating to your consciousness\ndirectly. You're in the middle of a game, so\nyou don't need a transmitter."	
Message	Shido	"In a game... What?!
Th-This is... virtual reality?"	
Message	None	"(I rushed to touch the nearby chairs and walls.
This... feels exactly like home.)"	
Message	None	"(I tried touching my face. Yeah, the way I move
my arm and the way my skin feels is like
normal.)"	
Message	Shido	If I pinch my cheeks, would it hurt...?	
Message	Shido	Ouch! Wait, it totally hurts.	
Message	Kotori	"Your five senses are intact. I told you, this\nis a super-simulated reality. The you in this\nworld is no different than the you in reality."	
Message	Shido	So this is super-simulated reality...	
Message	Kotori	"To be exact, we haven't turned everything\ninto data. Some of the objects, like the\nfurniture, are replicated from your memory."	
Message	Shido	I'm creating it from memory...?	
Message	Kotori	"Well, don't sweat the details. Oh, and the\ntransmitter isn't as reliable as usual."	
Message	Shido	So... kind of like bad reception?	
Message	Kotori	"It's a little different. Your brain synapses and\nreality... Time just flows differently."	
Message	Kotori	"The simulated reality is faster. So if you\nspend a whole day there, in reality it's only\nten or twenty minutes... Something like that."	
Message	Kotori	"So we're adjusting the time there to\ncommunicate with you... Anyways, we can\ncontact you well enough to an extent."	
Message	Kotori	"But we can't give you orders as detailed as\nusual. Well... that's why it's a simulator...\nConsider it as a way to up your game."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... I kind of get it, but I still don't
understand it fully."	
Message	Shido	So, what am I supposed to do?	
Message	Kotori	"Why don't we start by getting out of the house?\nThere are some events implemented, but for\nnow, just get used to the controls."	
Message	Shido	Got it. I'll walk around.	
Message	Shido	Man, I'm inside a game, huh...	
Message	None	"(I don't sense that anything is off. It all
looks completely normal. As usual, Ratatoskr's
technology is just unbelievable.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori. Is all of this around me data, too?	
Message	Kotori	"Yup. It's pretty much non-playable characters\nthat we're controlling via the programming.\nYou can chat with them."	
Message	Shido	Wow...	
Message	Kotori	"We couldn't turn all civilians of Tengu City\ninto data so it's not completely the same. But\nyour neighbors are replicated from memory."	
Message	Shido	Oh, maybe if they're my neighbors... Oh, hello.	
Message	None	"(I made eye contact with my neighbor Saito-san
and greeted her out of habit.)"	
Message	Saito-san	"Oh, my. Hello, Shido-kun. Are you running
errands? You're such a good boy."	
Message	Shido	Oh, um...	
Message	None	(Whoa, crazy. She's just like the usual Saito-san.)	
Message	None	"(Since I did think of making dinner earlier...
I was walking toward the market.)"	
Message	Shido	"Everywhere looks like the real thing...
I feel like I can just shop for groceries."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Shopping for groceries? What's for\ndinner, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Tohka! Wait, is this a transmission, too?	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah. We're all observing you. The Shido here\nlooks like he's sleeping, but on the screen,\nyou're walking. It's amazing!"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, so the images here are playing on the
monitor in the room... I feel self-conscious
knowing that everyone's watching."	
Message	Tohka	"I want to eat menchi katsu today!\nShido, go to the meat shop there and buy\nsome menchi katsu!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh, even if I were to buy it here, it's not like
I can take it back with me."	
Message	Shido	Huh? If I eat here, would I be able to taste it?	
Message	Kotori	"We've also replicated taste, so you would be\nable to taste it. Your brain will recognize it\nas food, so you'll feel full as well."	
Message	Kotori	"Of course, you won't get any nutrients from\nit, so the real you won't be full."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	(As I chatted with them—)	
Message	Shido	Whoa, excuse me...!	
Message	Tohka	"*Nom, nom*... *nom*! *Gulp*.
O-Oh! I'm sorry I bumped into you!"	
Message	Shido	Toh...ka? Uh... are you okay?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I'm running late so I was having some
bread. Then I bumped into you!"	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. Sorry, I wasn't looking either...
What are you late for?"	
Message	Tohka	I don't know!	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Tohka	"I just know that I have bread in my mouth
and say I'm running late, I can have a fateful
encounter if I bump into someone!"	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about...?	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, you're supposed to have a fateful
reunion with me in the classroom!"	
Message	Tohka	I'll be waiting for you, Shido!	
Message	Shido	What is going on...	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, wow! Kotori, I'm talking to Shido on the\nscreen!"	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah, isn't it pretty fun? It's just data, so I\nthink the behaviors are a bit different."	
Message	Tohka	"It's me, but it's not me... That's very strange.\nHowever, I feel like it lacks intelligence."	
Message	Shido	Well, uh... I don't know.	
Message	Shido	Are you okay?	
Message	Origami	"No problem. I was about to be late so I was
running with toast in my mouth, but I happened
to have a fateful encounter with you. That's all."	
Message	Shido	"...Origami? I don't know what
you're talking about."	
Message	Origami	"It is the best way to express that you are late.
And by bumping into someone, you and I have
made a fateful encounter."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Like in an old school manga. Well, fateful
encounter or not, we already know each
another."	
Message	Origami	"That's right. We are already lovers. However,
lovers also need stimulation."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...?	
Message	None	"(Crap. No matter what I say, I feel like it's not
going to end well...!)"	
Message	Origami	"After our fateful reunion, we're going to
spend some heated time together. We can do
it now, if you don't mind."	
Message	Shido	"Obviously I mind! We're in public, in broad
daylight!"	
Message	Origami	"That's right. Then as originally planned, we will
reunite later in the classroom."	
Message	Shido	So that was her plan, huh...	
Message	Origami	I'll be waiting.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. The flow of time pushes me onto a fateful
path, as I hold the provisions of harvest in my
mouth. A chance meeting like this occurs..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Admiration. We were late, and bumped into one
another with toast in our mouths. This must be
a fateful encounter for Yuzuru."	
Message	Shido	Kaguya?! Yuzuru...?!	
Message	Kaguya	"Wait, Yuzuru. I am the one who created the
fateful encounter."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Denied. Yuzuru bumped into him first.
Therefore, the fateful encounter is with
Yuzuru, Kaguya."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Impossible. There is no way that I will
be late...!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Both speed and timing were the
same. That means the rest is just a matter of
our physique and whose chest hit him first."	
Message	Kaguya	"Ch-Chest size has nothing to do with this!
Then Yuzuru, you're heavier than me, so you
should be slower than me."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Angry. You should not have said the word "heavy".
No matter how cute and perfect you are, Kaguya,
that is a forbidden word."	
Message	Kaguya	"Yuzuru, no matter how pretty you are and how
perfect your proportions are, I'm the one who
bumped into Shido first!"	
Message	None	"(Kaguya and Yuzuru growled as they glared at
each other. What am I supposed to do...?)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Question. Shido, who do you think touched you
first?"	
Message	Shido	"What?! I honestly don't know, but... If I were to
pick... I'd say it was at the same time."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. I wouldn't be surprised of the
miraculous timing, given that it is the two
of us..."	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh... Our soul is made up of two wings, bound
together by fate. We will continue to find an
answer later..! Hehe... Hahahahaha!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh... I wonder if they think that, because we
bumped into each other like this, we'll reunite
later..."	
Message	Miku	Awwww, dear me! I bumped into you!	
Message	Shido	M-Miku...? What are you doing here?	
Message	Miku	"I was running late so I had to carry the toast
with my mouth! And then... who would've
thought I'd bump into you, darling!"	
Message	Miku	"Ah♪ Darling, to do this in such a public place...
You're so bold."	
Message	Shido	"I didn't do anything! You're the one who...
Um... pushed your chest..."	
Message	None	(...Against me. It's so soft...)	
Message	Tohka	"Argh! What are you doing, Miku?! Hurry up and
get away from Shido."	
Message	Kotori	Tohka, don't get in the way. This is a game.	
Message	Miku	"That's right～ My darling is totally into me right
now... That's just it."	
Message	Tohka	Grr...	
Message	Shido	"A-Anyways, could you take a step back? I don't
think we bumped into each other that strongly,
did we?"	
Message	Miku	"Let's stay stuck like this forever.
Gosh, darling, you're so shy."	
Message	Miku	"But I was able to have a fateful encounter with
you, so next time we'll have to have a fateful
reunion as well, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Fateful reunion...?	
Message	Miku	Look forward for it. All right, darling. Later～	
Message	Kotori	"Ow, ow, ow... Who did I just bump into... Oh?!
Onii-chan!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Kotori? What are you doing here?	
Message	Kotori	"I was running late, so I had to keep the toast in
my mouth. What a coincidence!"	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about? Late...?
It's already after school."	
Message	Kotori	"It seems like the game is set in the morning\nright now."	
Message	Shido	"Morning... Well, I made breakfast this morning,
remember? You don't have to run with toast in your
mouth. It's not good for your digestion."	
Message	Kotori	"I-I know... I'm sorry, Onii-chan. But to bump into
you around a corner like this... gets my heart
racing..."	
Message	Shido	...What's the matter, Kotori? You're acting weird.	
Message	Kotori	N-No! It's nothing! Later, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Later.	
Message	Kotori	"Reine, what the heck was that?"	
Message	Reine	"The NPC version of Kotori, obviously..."	
Message	Kotori	"Why is she like that?! Sh-She's blushing all over\nShido!"	
Message	Reine	"Hm...? I thought I had replicated you to a T.\nI extracted the data from when you were in your\nroom yo—"	
Message	Kotori	"AHHHHHH! I-It seems like something's gumming\nup the replication, so let's revisit it at another\ntime..."	
Message	Kurumi	"We've bumped into one another. I feel like fate
has brought us together."	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?! What are you doing here...?	
Message	None	"(Wait... I thought I already went through this
scenario. Wait, no, that was reality... I'm
starting to get confused.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm kind of in a rush, so I was running with toast
in my mouth... and then I bumped into you."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, that's totally weird! It's not even
morning! Why do you have toast in your mouth?!"	
Message	Kurumi	"My, what bad manners, Shido-san. Girls have their
reasons. Please do not question that."	
Message	Shido	What...	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my... Unfortunately I don't have time to be
talking to you. However, if we were to reunite
once again, would you not say that it's fate?"	
Message	Shido	Reunite... Where do you plan on reuniting with me?	
Message	Kurumi	That is a secret.	
Message	Kurumi	"Or if you really want to... We can unite
right here, right now."	
Message	Shido	E-Excuse me?! Wh-What are you talking about?!	
Message	Kurumi	"I may be late, but if I can give my body to you,
Shido-san, then I would not mind the delay this
time..."	
Message	Shido	"N-No, no, no, no! You're in a hurry, right?!
Then forget about me, just go!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, my. That's unfortunate. Then, I will see you
next time."	
Message	Yoshino	*Whimper*... S-Sorry... I was in a rush...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino? What are you doing here?	
Message	Yoshino	"O-Oh... I was in a rush, and I um... had toast
in my mouth..."	
Message	Shido	"Toast? Oh, like the "running late" type of thing?
But where are you rushing to...?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoo-hoo, Shido-kun! Who cares where?\nAnyways, anyways, do you not notice anything?"	
Message	Shido	Hm? What do you mean?	
Message	Yoshinon	"You're so dim! Seriously so dim, Shido-kun!\nA girl running with toast in her mouth! And then\nyou bumped into her by accident!"	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I'm sorry. I... wasn't looking
where I was going..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's not it! Yoshino, you should know, too!\nI mean in the sweet, sweet shoujo manga you're\nreading!"	
Message	Yoshino	W-Wait.... Yoshinon, what are you talking about?	
Message	Yoshinon	"A bump like this is the beginning of love! Bam!\nYou bump into him, then you look at each other!\nYoshino waiting! Shido-kun's heart throbbing!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon... S-Stop... Th-That's embarrassing...	
Message	Yoshinon	"This is definitely a fateful encounter! Don't you\nthink so, Shido-kun?!"	
Message	Shido	"Um, but it's not like we've just met for the first
time..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"A-ha! You don't get it at all! With the fateful\nencounter, the girl you looked at as a little\nsister becomes a lady in your eyes."	
Message	Yoshino	"A l-lady... That's impossible..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"No, it's not! Well, you just wait and see,\nShido-kun. This meeting will become the\nstart of true love!"	
Message	Shido	"I...I don't get what's going on, but...
Uh, Yoshino... it's dangerous, so you
watch where you're going, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay... Thank... you...	
Message	Shido	"And don't run with food in your mouth. If you come
by the house, I can make you food anytime."	
Message	Yoshino	Okay... um... Sorry...	
Message	Yoshinon	"What, what?! Ignoring Yoshinon! Whatever! Love\nstories happen when you least expect it! You'd\nbetter look forward to the reunion!"	
Message	Yoshino	"G-Gosh...! Yoshino, let's go.
Shido-san, um... sorry about that..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's fine. Be careful, okay?	
Message	Shido	Anyways, what was all that about...?	
Message	Kotori	"An event. Duh. It's a gal game,\nwhat did you expect?"	
Message	Shido	Event?	
Message	None	"(True. I remember events being forced on me during
"My Little Shido"...)"	
Message	None	"(Although the technology had clearly improved,
it's still a shameful game.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, that was just a sample. As you spend time\nin this world, there will be even more events."	
Message	Shido	I can't imagine anything but bad things.	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. Don't you think the NPCs were really\nhigh quality?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I thought it was the actual person... Can't
believe it was just appearances. The event,
however, seemed pretty forced...""	
Message	Kotori	"For the events to occur, we have to have\na setting unique to the game's world. What's\nimportant is the personality replication."	
Message	Shido	Hmm... Well, I guess it wasn't that off...	
Message	Reine	"Then again, it's not perfect, either. It's\nextremely hard to replicate emotions,\nespecially love."	
Message	Kotori	"That will be our challenge from now on."	
Message	Kotori	"Now, let's try going to school."	
Message	Shido	We're still going...? *sigh*.	
Message	Shido	"The school looks perfect, too... I thought I was
used to this, but I'm still surprised how well
the inside of the school's been replicated."	
Message	Reine	"...What's being replicated is only a portion of\nTengu City. It's only the range of things that you\nknow well, Shin."	
Message	Shido	Are all the students here, too?	
Message	Reine	"Yeah... I've replicated all students and faculty.\nHowever, with people you've never spoken to,\nonly their appearance has been replicated."	
Message	Shido	Wow... That's amazing.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yo, Itsuka. What's the matter? Why are you
pretending to be in deep thought outside
the school gates?"	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi... He's an NPC too, right?	
Message	Reine	"Yeah, he is."	
Message	Shido	He seems like his usual self.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Wh-What is it, Itsuka? You're staring at me so
intently... What are your intentions...?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Just thinking of how you look so much like
the original."	
Message	Tonomachi	"What? What's with you, Itsuka? Have you finally
lost it to the point where you can't differentiate
your imagination from reality?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Very well... Then I will show you...
What reality is."	
Message	Shido	Um, no thanks.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Don't be like that, Itsuka. No way a lame guy like
you can live a life surrounded by cute girls."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Tonomachi	"What I'm saying is, you shouldn't be able to be
close with Tohka-chan, Tobiichi, the hot twins,
and even Miku-tan—"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Impossible! That's totally impossible! Basically,
this is all your daydream! You got it?!"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, yeah. I see. I think you're overtired,
Tonomachi."	
Message	Tonomachi	"I-I'm fine! You're the abnormal one! And this
world, too! WAHHHHH!"	
Message	Shido	Man, he really does look like the real one.	
Message	Kotori	"Right? Well, I guess you can tell how things are.\nYou're going to live a gal game life in this\nworld."	
Message	Shido	It feels more tiring than the last game...	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Shido	That was...?	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, there was a girl I've never seen before.	
Message	Reine	"No, that's impossible. As I told you earlier,\nthere shouldn't be a person in this world\nthat you don't know."	
Message	Shido	Hmm... But it was a girl I've never met before.	
Message	Reine	"Maybe you didn't see her properly, or you just\nforgot her."	
Message	Shido	No... I don't think I've ever seen her before.	
Message	Reine	"...How odd. There shouldn't be such NPCs..."	
Message	Shido	"Then let me check. There's also a chance that
I saw her on TV or something, right...?"	
Message	Reine	"Yeah... Try going after her."	
Message	Shido	I thought I saw her walking this way...	
Message	Shido	—There she is! Hm... I don't recognize her.	
Message	Shido	"She seems to be wearing a unique outfit... I would
never forget someone like her."	
Message	None	"(Her hair color is very unique, and she's very
cute. There's no way... I'd forget.)"	
Message	Reine	"Something's off. There's no data on that girl.\nWho is she...?"	
Message	Shido	...Uh, excuse me?	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	I know this sounds weird, but have we met before?	
Message	Shido	Oh, I'm not hitting on you or anything!	
Message	???	...	
Message	None	"(There was no response. But she was staring at me
with a serious expression.)"	
Message	Shido	U-Um... What are you doing here...?	
Message	???	...	
Message	Reine	"...She's not responding. Maybe there's some kind\nof error, and some outside data got mixed in."	
Message	Kotori	"So an NPC that's actually a bug, right?\nWell, that seems the most probable."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, just leave her be for now. Let's see...\nWhy don't we end the test playthrough for today."	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it.	
Message	???	...	
Message	None	"(So, superficial data means she's a hologram with
nothing actually inside.)"	
Message	None	"(But despite that... I felt such
power in her gaze.)"
