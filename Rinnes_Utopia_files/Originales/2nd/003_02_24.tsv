Message	Shido	If I were to pick... I guess it'd be Miku...	
Message	Miku	Hehehe. Darling, I'm so happy!	
Message	Yuzuru	Upset. Shido is going to choose Miku.	
Message	Kaguya	"That is one foolish decision, Shido! How dare
you fall for the forbidden fruit..."	
Message	Shido	Uh, it's not like that...	
Message	Tohka	Shido! You date me! Date! Date!	
Message	Origami	"I don't understand, Shido. You're my boyfriend,
so you should date me."	
Message	Shido	Crap... We're circling back to square one...	
Message	None	"(I know! At a time like this... I'm going to have
to call the Fraxinus for help...)"	
Message	None	"(Whenever I run into issues, they always give me
some pointers or instructions. They should be
able to save me from this situation...!)"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you seem to be in trouble, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Perfect timing, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(My little sister Kotori is the Commander of the
Fraxinus. She should be a dependable advisor at
a time like this... I think.)"	
Message	Shido	Can you solve this problem for me?	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm. The girls in front of you, aside from\nOrigami, may possibly go berserk if you\nhurt them carelessly. You know that, right?"	
Message	Shido	I know that. That's why I'm struggling.	
Message	Kotori	"And you're going to choose Miku, knowing\nthat?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I've known Miku for the least amount of
time. So I figured she might be the most
unstable."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Well, surprisingly, it looks like you've\nthought it through for once. Then you do that.\nI'll handle the others."	
Message	Shido	Got it, thanks.	
Message	Shido	All right Miku, let's run.	
Message	Miku	Aww, darling. You're so aggressive.	
Message	None	(We held each others' hands and ran for it.)	
Message	Miku	Hehe. Where do you want to go, darling?	
Message	Shido	H-Hm... Anyways, Miku.	
Message	Miku	What is it, darling?	
Message	Shido	You just started your career as an idol, right?	
Message	Miku	Yes～ It's all thanks to you, darling.	
Message	None	"(Miku used to be an idol, but got dragged into
trouble and lost her voice.)"	
Message	None	"(After she overcame it with the power of the
Spirit, she uses her vocal abilities to do as she
pleases, but...)"	
Message	Miku	"Darling, you said you'd be my fan no matter
what, so I decided to try again."	
Message	None	"(...Well, that's her understanding of the
events.)"	
Message	Shido	"So that means you must be pretty busy, right?
Are you okay to kill time here?"	
Message	None	"(She's a year older and goes to a different
school, but she always finds a reason to come
visit me.)"	
Message	None	"(Miku is currently a student and an idol. She
has to be busy...)"	
Message	Miku	"I have today off, so it's all good. Hehe, you're
so kind, darling."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... I guess that's all that matters.	
Message	None	"(If she was busy, I thought I'd be freed... but
I'll keep that to myself.)"	
Message	Shido	Uh... Let's see. Date... huh?	
Message	Miku	Yes. I want to walk with you.	
Message	Shido	All right, then let's walk around.	
Message	Miku	Hehe, today is such a nice day!	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. But I feel like people are watching
us..."	
Message	Miku	You think so?	
Message	Passerby A	Isn't that Miku Izayoi?	
Message	Passerby B	What? No way. There's no way she'd be here.	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh maybe we shouldn't be out in public.
You're pretty famous..."	
Message	Miku	What, no I'm not～ I'm not quite there yet～	
Message	Shido	...Wait a minute!	
Message	Miku	What is it, darling?	
Message	Shido	Th-That billboard. O-Of course you're famous!	
Message	Miku	Haha, you're right. That is me.	
Message	Shido	"If we're walking right by it, it's obvious that
it's you."	
Message	Miku	Who cares if people find out? I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	You should! You're an idol!	
Message	Miku	"I may be an idol, but more than that, I'm your
Miku♪"	
Message	Passerby A	Uoooo! Isn't that Miku-tan?	
Message	Passerby B	What? Miku-tan is with some guy. Who is that?	
Message	Shido	C-Crap! This isn't good!	
Message	Miku	"It's fine. They wouldn't think the real deal
would be here."	
Message	Shido	"Even if you're okay with it, I'm not! I sense
danger!"	
Message	Miku	Aww, really?	
Message	Shido	Of course! Anyways, we should...	
Message	Miku	"Then, do you want to leave? I'm fine anywhere,
as long as it's with you."	
Message	Passerby A	What's up with that guy? All close to Miku-tan.	
Message	Passerby B	A man for Miku-tan?! Ahhhh, it's all over!	
Message	Shido	Crap, Miku! Let's run!	
Message	Miku	Huh? Running again?	
Message	None	"(And so we ran—seriously, literally ran through
our date.)"
