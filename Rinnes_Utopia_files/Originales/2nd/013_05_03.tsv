Message	Yoshino	"C-Cute... The feeling of wanting to... protect a
person... I think?"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... So is that a same kind of love toward a
pet? I can see Arusu asking something like that.."	
Message	Yoshino	A-Am I... a pet?	
Message	Shido	H-How did you come to that conclusion?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, you're such a dummy, Shido-kun. Yoshino\nanswered your question, assuming that's how\nyou see her."	
Message	Yoshinon	"In another words, if you think that way about\nYoshino, then that means, in theory, you love\nYoshino."

Message	Yoshino	I...I didn't... say that...	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yoshino...
