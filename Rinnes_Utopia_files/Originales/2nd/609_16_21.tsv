Message	Reine	...Stop. It looks as though the path to the\nMother Room is just right there.	
Message	Shido	"This area. It looks like space has been ripped
in half."	
Message	Reine	...Yes. Correct. From here on, there is no\ndefined path.	
Message	Maria	"I believe I can lead the way. I can feel
Marina's presence nearby."	
Message	Reine	How helpful. She should be able to sense\nyou as well. Be careful.	
Message	Shido	Okay, let's go.	
Message	None	"(Man, what a sight. It's almost like there's
ground beneath my feet. But if I let my
guard down, I confuse my ups from downs.)"	
Message	Maria	This way...	
Message	Shido	"There's no way to tell how far we've gone
in here."	
Message	Maria	"The disorientation you are feeling is more
extreme than it seems. Try not to focus on
it. We are definitely getting closer."	
Message	Tohka	Shido, she is coming!	
Message	Marina	"Goodness. You don't know when to quit,
Shido Itsuka. Ladies hate men who are
too persistent. Haven't you heard?"	
Message	Shido	"Marina, enough of this! You're making
everyone miserable!"	
Message	Marina	"That's not true. I already know. Even if I
destroy this world, there is one person who
supports me. So it is a necessary sacrifice."	
Message	Shido	"Even so, there's no way to justify the deaths
of so many people!"	
Message	Marina	"Nor is there one to justify your hypocrisy,
Shido Itsuka. You should have submitted to
despair, and awaited your erasure."	
Message	Tohka	"Do not jest, you Artificial Spirit! Shido and I
will not relent in a place such as this! Come
at us! We shall end this!"	
Message	Marina	"End this? You mean disappear before me,
right?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... How foolish. You intend to take on
all of us by yourself?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Warning. Kaguya, only a villain would
use a cliché like that. Read the right line."	
Message	Kaguya	"U-Urgh... But just look around! It befits our
situation! We have the upper hand, don't we?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Denial. Presuming to have an advantage is
exactly how trouble strikes."	
Message	Marina	"Haha... Ahahahah! Good judgment there,
Berserk! I know all about you."	
Message	Marina	"Astral Dresses, Angels. They pose a deadly
threat in the digital world as they do in the
real world. But did you think I wouldn't prepare?"	
Message	Shido	Are those clones...? Like Kurumi?	
Message	Marina	"How is it? Hmm? How is it? Of course, in
this world, I don't need to use this gimmick,
but I don't have time to play with you."	
Message	Shido	"Are there dozens of her...? No, there's more
than that!"	
Message	Kurumi	My, my. She's provoking us quite a bit.	
Message	Shido	Is it anything like your clones, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	"""They differ slightly from ""us"". ""They"" are
me"" from another timeline, but this—"	
Message	Reine	They're exact copies. Much like Kurumi's\nother selves, the real Marina is the strongest,\nbut with so many—	
Message	Marina	"That's right. There's no limit. I can copy
myself as many times as I want."	
Message	Marina	Can you *really* win?	
Message	Tohka	...Maria.	
Message	Maria	Yes, what is it, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Is the main Artificial Spirit among them?	
Message	Maria	No, most likely not. All of these are replicas.	
Message	Miku	"Is that so～? Then this should be a piece
of cake."	
Message	Marina	You're carefree, Diva.	
Message	Miku	"Well, think about it. If you could really
produce endless copies, there'd be no
reason to hide the main body, no?"	
Message	Miku	"If you're still hidden from sight, then you're
afraid of the possibility of losing, aren't you?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Precisely. Well, she may be doing this
solely to waste our time."	
Message	Kotori	Exactly. Too bad for you, Marina!	
Message	Marina	Ha... We'll see about that!	
Message	Kotori	"You getting flustered is evidence enough!
Shido, take Maria and go ahead."	
Message	Shido	Are you planning to stay behind, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"""Right. I'm doing a ""Go ahead and leave it
to me"" bit."	
Message	Shido	"Isn't it better if everyone fought as a
group? There's too many of her."	
Message	Yoshinon	Didn't Reine-san say there's no time? That's\nwhy you gotta go, Shido-kun and Maria-chan!	
Message	Yoshino	"We're... fine here. We'll hold them back as a
team."	
Message	Shido	Even you, Yoshino? Well, I...	
Message	Kotori	"Just go, you dullard. We may have our
Astral Dresses and Angels, but it has no
effect on you. Know what that means?"	
Message	Shido	Does that mean...?!	
Message	Kotori	Yes, exactly. You protect Maria.	
Message	Yoshino	"Please go... Shido-san. Please believe in
us. We believe in you, so..."	
Message	Shido	"Right! Maria, let's go. Do you know where
the real Marina might be?"	
Message	Maria	Yes, perhaps... This way!	
Message	Shido	Let's hurry, Maria!	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Although they are not as strong as
the main Marina, they still have Spirit-like
powers. Everyone... may struggle in battle."	
Message	Shido	As I thought.	
Message	Maria	Are you worried...?	
Message	Shido	No, I trust in them.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I trust in them as well. Over here, let
us hurry."	
Message	Shido	Right!
