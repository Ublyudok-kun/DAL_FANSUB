Message	Miku	Darling, let's play together.	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Miku. I just want to rest.	
Message	Shido	And besides, I need to think about that question.	
Message	Miku	Oh... The "what is love" thing?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm really struggling here.	
Message	Miku	"Are you really? But our relationship is totally
lovey-dovey, so what we have must be it!"	
Message	Shido	Uh... But how would you explain that feeling?	
Message	Miku	"Well～ Darling, whenever I'm stressed about
something, you think things through with me. And
when I feel stuck, you take a new step with me."	
Message	Miku	It was out of love, right?!	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess you have something there.	
Message	Miku	"If you were having troubles with your afterschool
club or anything, and if I were your senior, I
would probably come up with a resolution with you."	
Message	Shido	I see. That was really helpful.	
Message	Miku	No problem at all. Anything for you, darling!	
Message	Shido	"But still, that's not much of an answer...
Hmm, so hard..."
