Message	Tohka	Hm. What should I order?	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, if you keep ordering so much, I'll
go broke..."	
Message	None	"(Game world or not, there is a limit to how
much money I have.)"	
Message	Maria	"Even if you run out, I am capable of making
arrangements."	
Message	Shido	"No, that's no good. It wouldn't be fair. Besides,
it's good to stay under budget. Gotta make sure
I stay responsible in here."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmhmhm. Thankfully for Shido-san, you
have a talented assortment of women to
entertain on your dime."	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm. However, I couldn't bear to trouble you,
Shido. I will select only one dish."	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Tohka, thanks.	
Message	Kaguya	"Then, I must select the most glorious dish
of all! The Triple Jumbo Ultra Deluxe Parfait!
A sundae the gods would be proud of! Here I go!"	
Message	Miku	"Hm, then I pick... this Special Afternoon Tea
Set."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, listen to me! If it's too expensive, I
won't be able to pay for it all!"	
Message	Miku	Hrrm～. Then I choose this pancake set.	
Message	Kaguya	"It can't be helped. Then, I want this
strawberry parfait."	
Message	Kurumi	Then, I select the cheesecake set.	
Message	Tohka	"H-Hmm. Please wait a moment. I cannot
decide."	
Message	Shido	"Take your time, Tohka. What about you,
Maria?"	
Message	Maria	Um, Shido... I have a problem.	
Message	Shido	What's wrong? Did something happen?	
Message	Maria	"Every dish attracts me. I know too little
about each in order to decide."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's what you mean...	
Message	Maria	"There are some I do not recognize by name
alone. Just in case, can I confirm with you if
I have all of the relevant information?"	
Message	Shido	Sure. I hope I can answer your questions.	
Message	Maria	"Yes, thank you. Then Shido, what is the
brioche des rois?"	
Message	Shido	"You know that brioche is a kind of bread,
right?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Also, with "des rois", I understand
that it pertains to a galette des rois."	
Message	Shido	"Yep, that's correct. A brioche des rois is
a foreign treat that is a brioche bread
topped with dried fruit."	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What?! That item is on the menu?!
What an enticing property!"	
Message	Maria	"I see. Then, is this galette similar to what
my understanding is of it?"	
Message	Shido	"So it's a dish that uses a crepe-like dough to
wrap its insides. This one has galette au sucre,
which has stuff like boiled apples and ice cream."	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh, that sounds delicious as well!
"	
Message	Tohka	Oogh, I can't decide...	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, calm down a bit. How's this, why don't
you choose what to get with Maria? You're
still thinking it over, Tohka, so take your time."	
Message	Maria	"It is difficult to choose on command. All of
what you describe sounds attractive, Shido, but
I cannot pull my eyes from the others as well."	
Message	Tohka	I'm the same, Shido. This is no easy task...	
Message	Shido	Ahh. What to do...	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmhmhm. It can't be helped. Maria-san, I
will split my cake with you. That way, we
can enjoy a range of flavors, eh?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. If that's the case, I'll give you a
portion of my parfait as well."	
Message	Maria	"Splitting...? You mean, assigning what you
ordered to everyone else. I see. That would
reduce the need for choices then."	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes, you got it. In exchange, we'll sample
whatever you order as well, Maria-san."	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. It's an equivalent exchange, then.
If we all choose something different and split
it, we'll be able to enjoy an array of treats!"	
Message	Miku	"There are six people here today, which means
we can select up to six desserts～."	
Message	Maria	"Even the exchange itself sounds fun. Then,
I will choose the brioche des rois, based on
Shido's description."	
Message	Shido	Okay then. So... Tohka, have you decided?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I have decided as well, Shido! Please
call the manager!"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa, hey! You only do that when you have
a complaint. The attendant will come over..."	
Message	None	"(I'm glad everyone was able to decide.
Without their teamwork, no one would
have chosen.)"	
Message	Shido	Now then, looks like we're all set.	
Message	None	"(When their orders arrived, the girls began
sharing the sweets and tasting as they pleased.)"	
Message	Maria	"I was correct to ask you, Shido. This is very
delicious."	
Message	Shido	"I see. That's good. Oh, do you want to try
my chocolate cake, too?"	
Message	Maria	"If you do not mind, Shido, then I would like
to."	
Message	Kurumi	Then, I shall share my cheesecake with you.	
Message	Miku	Have some of my pancake～.	
Message	None	"(Everyone's desserts were piling up in front
of Maria.)"	
Message	Maria	"Everyone, thank you kindly. All of them were
truly delicious. Also, I feel strange..."	
Message	Shido	Strange...?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Nothing has happened, but I am having
more fun than usual, or I am happier... It is
a difficult emotion to explain."	
Message	Shido	"That’s probably because you're eating with
everyone here. Food even tastes better when
you're laughing and dining with friends."	
Message	Maria	Together... with everyone?	
Message	Kaguya	"Indeed. We have shared from the same
offerings of food. This is how alliances
are formed."	
Message	Kurumi	"In other words, it means we are friends. Isn't it
wonderful, to spend time and converse like this?"	
Message	Miku	"That's right. That's right～. From today on,
I'm your friend too, Maria-chan～."	
Message	Tohka	Of course! Me as well, Maria! We are friends!	
Message	Maria	F...Friends...	
Message	Shido	"That's right. These are people you can talk
and hang out with any time."	
Message	Maria	Of course... I understand that much.	
Message	Shido	Ah. Right, of course.	
Message	Maria	"But I see... These... are friends.
I believe I have come to understand more."	
Message	Miku	"So, what's next on the agenda～? Wanna
look around at more shops?"	
Message	Shido	"Today, I planned to go wherever you wanted
to go, Maria. Is there anything else you wanted
to see?"	
Message	Maria	"Um, there is one place I wish to go, Shido.
I hope this does not come off as rude, but
is it okay if I take some of Shido's time?"	
Message	Kurumi	"My, Maria-san. How bold. I know my answer,
but what does everyone else think?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Ha. Today is a celebration of our bond forming,
Maria. I must grant the wish of my brethren."	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm, since today is nearly over, it cannot be
helped. Maria, please look after Shido!"	
Message	Maria	Okay!	
Message	Shido	"Why am I the one who needs to be looked
after? Anyway, thanks for coming out today,
everyone."	
Message	Miku	"Today was a blast～. Maria-chan, let's do
it again sometime. Even time without darling
can be bearable."	
Message	Maria	Yes, I would like to.	
Message	Shido	"So where's this place you wanted to go?
Can we head there right now?"	
Message	Maria	"Do not worry. It isn't far from here.
Now then, let us go, Shido."
