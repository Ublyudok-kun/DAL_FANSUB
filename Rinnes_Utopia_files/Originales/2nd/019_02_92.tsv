Message	None	"(Okay, so Maria went to the next classroom over,
but... I'm worried.)"	
Message	None	"(I hope nothing bad will happen. I can't focus on
class like this.)"	
Message	Students	*Bustle*	
Message	Shido	Is that... noise coming from next door?	
Message	???	"S...do... Shido!
Requesting, Shido. Please respond..."	
Message	Shido	Hm... Yuzuru, is that you?	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's the matter, Yuzuru? What's happening
in the other class?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Shido, please come over. Arusu is...	
Message	Shido	"I knew it. Got it, I'll be over right away. You go
on ahead."	
Message	Yuzuru	Roger. I'll be waiting for you.	
Message	Shido	Tohka. Sorry, but I need to ask you a favor.	
Message	Tohka	"...Huh? I wasn't sleeping, I was just closing
my eyes!"	
Message	Shido	"Calm down, Tohka. It's me. I have a favor to ask
you, so please hear me out."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, Shido. What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Seems like Maria did something next door. I'm
going to go check in on her, so can you keep a
Takadai for me while I'm gone?"	
Message	Tohka	Sure, go on ahead.	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Tohka.	
Message	Shido	All right, I have to head next door.	
Message	Shido	Yuzuru, tell me what's going on.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Shido, my faithful servant. You have
finally arrived. If you wish to know what's going
on, it will be faster to see for yourself..."	
Message	None	"(Faster to see for myself? Uh, Maria is...
There she is.)"	
Message	None	"(She's in the back listening to class. Oh, not
that big of a deal.)"	
Message	Maria	Excuse me, Okamine-sensei. I have a question.	
Message	Students	*Commotion*	
Message	None	"(Oh, seems like she has a question. But why's
everyone making so much noise?)"	
Message	Tamae	Yesss... What is it, Arusu-saaan...?	
Message	Maria	"About what you mentioned earlier, I believe there
is a mistake."	
Message	Tamae	N-Not again... That's the textbook's fault...	
Message	Shido	Ah... I see.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. This is exactly it. Can you do
something about it?"	
Message	Shido	W-We need to stop Arusu, don't we...?	
Message	None	"(I tried to not get caught by other students, and
snuck over to where Maria was standing in the
back.)"	
Message	Shido	"Arusu, you can't. Don't point out the errors
in the textbook."	
Message	Maria	"I had a feeling that was the case. I heard you can
point out errors in the form of a question, but
I couldn't get a good response during my testing."	
Message	Shido	"I see... This isn't good. But I know I was the one
who told you to participate, so I want to figure
something out for you."	
Message	None	"Hm... What can we do? Maybe I can ask for
someone's cooperation..."	
Choice		Ask Kotori to help.	
Choice		Ask the Yamai Sisters to help.	
Choice		Ask Miku to help.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori's always dependable in times like these.
She's always supporting me from the Fraxinus."	
Message	None	"(Although, if Kotori's been here all along, then
shouldn't she have handled it? What's my little
sister doing?)"	
Message	Shido	Uh, where's Kotori?	
Message	Shido	"There she is. She's focusing. I wonder what she's
doing..."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori. What are you doing... Hey!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Onii-chan. You can't look yet.	
Message	Shido	"Now isn't the time to be putting lipstick on
Hideyoshi! You're making the people look like
they're working at Nichome!"	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, you're so annoying.	
Message	Shido	"What? This is an emergency. Can you return to your
black ribbon form?"	
Message	Kotori	Finnnee.	
Message	Kotori	Jeez Shido, what's your problem?	
Message	Shido	Already so mean?! And this is my fault?	
Message	Kotori	"Let me ask you this. Why are you leaving Arusu to
her own devices?"	
Message	Shido	"No, it's just... I thought she'd be fine because
you'd be here."	
Message	Kotori	"Arusu is observing things centered around you.
You know that, right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"Then you should be as close to her as you can.
Besides, if you can deal with problems as they
arise, maybe your ""romance"" points will go up."	
Message	Shido	Is that how it goes?	
Message	None	"(But that doesn't mean Kotori should be doodling
on historical figures.)"	
Message	Kotori	Whatever. Anyways, bring Arusu over.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Kotori	"""Don't ""okay"" me. Shido, I'm going to have to brief
you again on how to conduct yourself."""	
Message	None	(Oh no, Kotori's entering lecture mode...)	
Message	Maria	Kotori Itsuka? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	"Don't even start with that. I need to teach you
some things, so sit down."	
Message	None	"(At the end of the day, the great thing about
Kotori is that she's always looking out for us.)"	
Message	None	"(Maria and I had to ignore the class and listen to
what Kotori had to say. Arusu seemed interested,
so I guess it all worked out in the end.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, I have to go back now. Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	You owe me. Next time, deal with it yourself.	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it. I can't always depend on you, huh?	
Message	Kotori	As long as we're clear on that.	
Message	Shido	All right... Let's go back, Maria. ...Maria?	
Message	Maria	"Shido. I'm curious about something, so I'm going
to leave the classroom for a little bit."	
Message	Shido	"Hey. Wait, Maria...!
She's gone..."	
Message	Kotori	"Don't just hang your head like that. Hurry up and
go after her."	
Message	Shido	Okay, I will!	
Message	None	"(I guess I could consult with Kaguya and Yuzuru.
The three of us should be able to figure it out.)"	
Message	Shido	Kaguya, Yuzuru, any good ideas?	
Message	Yuzuru	Thinking. How can Arusu participate in class...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... There's that secret we learned
the other day."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Surprise. Secret... Don't tell me you're going to
use THAT, Kaguya."	
Message	Shido	Oh, what is it? Do you have a plan? What is it?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Shido may not know. But open your eyes and
see. These are the Devil's notes!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh...? Hey, Kaguya... This just looks like a cute
character memo pad."	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. It's very adorable.	
Message	Kaguya	"Well, you wait and see. You write a sentence...
Done. All right Shido, you take this."	
Message	Shido	Uh, so this is... passing notes?	
Message	Kaguya	Yes... A fun thing to do in class.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. We learned it the other day. It's
thrilling and something that every student should
know."	
Message	Shido	No, you're just playing around!	
Message	Kaguya	N-No good?	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess it is something for her to learn...	
Message	None	"(Although its value is pretty questionable, and I
feel like we're leading her down the wrong path,
this is the idea they've come up with.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, well. Let me give it to her, then.	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, Shido! A reply. We need her to reply. It's
mandatory."	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Get a response for two.	
Message	Shido	Okay, fine. I'll go over.	
Message	Kaguya	Be careful, Snake.	
Message	Shido	No, really not a snake...	
Message	None	(Well anyways, I'm going to head over to Maria.)	
Message	Shido	Maria. I have something for you.	
Message	Maria	...Shido, what is this?	
Message	Shido	"Uh... I guess doing secret things in class is part
of being a student."	
Message	Maria	I see. So what am I to do with this?	
Message	Shido	"You read what's written inside and write a
response. Once you're done, I'll take it back to
them. Normally, you pass it around class."	
Message	Maria	Understood. Give me a few moments.	
Message	Shido	Okay...!	
Message	None	(Uh... What am I doing...)	
Message	None	"(In the end, I went back and forth among the
three, delivering their notes throughout class.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Shido, good job.	
Message	Yuzuru	Thank you. I appreciate it, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"It was nothing. Anyways, what did you guys write?
And what was Arusu's response?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, the contents written here are protected by
the maidens' promise. I cannot disclose them, even
to you."	
Message	Yuzuru	Secret. We cannot tell.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I guess... But I'm glad you guys were able
to communicate with each other. I guess I'll
take Maria back with me."	
Message	Maria	Shido, you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Oh, perfect timing. What's the matter, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"I'm curious about something. I'm going to leave
the classroom for a little while."	
Message	Shido	Hey, where are you going?!	
Message	Shido	Jeez... Anyways, Kaguya, Yuzuru. See you later.	
Message	Kaguya	Okay. Good luck.	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Good luck, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me!	
Message	None	"(Hmm, maybe I can ask Miku to help me. I'm curious
what she'd come up with, anyway.)"	
Message	Shido	Miku, you got a moment? I need to ask you a favor.	
Message	Miku	"Oh, darling? What is it? We're in the middle of
class～"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I heard Arusu was causing problems. I want
her to find a way to participate in class. Do you
have any ideas?"	
Message	Miku	"Participate in class? Gosh, darling, I thought you
came to visit me, and instead you're talking about
her?"	
Message	Shido	A-Anyways... Can you lend me a hand?	
Message	Miku	"Very well. Since you're the one asking, I will
help. Buuuut..."	
Message	Shido	But?	
Message	Miku	"I personally feel like she doesn't have to force
herself to study～"	
Message	Shido	Well, but that's not right.	
Message	Miku	"Well, I mean listening in class and taking notes
is such a bore."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is, but... Hey, Miku...? Out of
curiosity, how are you in class usually?"	
Message	Miku	What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	"You know... How are you able to get through class
and tests?"	
Message	Miku	"That's easy. I ask the girls around me.
"	
Message	Miku	"Huh...? What's the matter, darling?
You look scary."	
Message	Shido	No, I was just thinking about what you said...	
Message	Miku	"Well I have my idol duties. So the teachers let me
slide～"	
Message	Shido	"Well that may be true, but... I think you should
participate in class too, then."	
Message	Miku	What?! I couldn't possibly!	
Message	Shido	"No talking back! I'm going to bring Maria too, so
open up your notebook."	
Message	Miku	Gosh, you're such a meanie, darling...	
Message	Maria	Shido... What should I do?	
Message	Shido	"I'm going to help you guys with the class. Well,
I'm not a real teacher, so I have my limitations,
but... Miku, especially you, brace yourself."	
Message	Miku	A-Ahhhh! 	
Message	None	"(In the end, I realized that Miku wasn't too
bright, so I tutored them both. Now I don't ask
why she's in my class in the virtual world.)"	
Message	Miku	Wahhh, darling, you're such a meanie.	
Message	None	"(Well, Arusu copied Miku and took notes. She
seemed interested in something new, so I guess
it worked out fine.)"	
Message	Shido	"I think I'll have to check in on you from time to
time, Miku."	
Message	Miku	"Very well. If you're going to check my studies,
then I will work a little harder."	
Message	Shido	Okay, fine.	
Message	Miku	Oh, and also be sure to give me a kiss for trying.	
Message	Shido	That's a no.	
Message	Miku	Gosh, darling. You're always so bashful.	
Message	Maria	"Shido, I'm curious about something, so I will be
leaving the classroom for a little while."	
Message	Shido	Wait, Maria! Oh, there she goes.	
Message	Miku	"Shouldn't you go back soon, darling? The next
class is about to start."	
Message	Shido	"Crap, you're right. And... I also need to bring
Maria back. Anyways Miku, I'll be leaving now."	
Message	Miku	Okay. Come visit me again soon, darling.
