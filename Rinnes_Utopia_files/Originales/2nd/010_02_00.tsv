Message	Shido	"All right. I'm heading to school, just as Kotori
told me, but..."	
Message	Shido	"Nothing new is happening. I didn't bump into
anyone around any corners... I thought I'd go
through all that again."	
Message	Shido	"At this rate, I'm really not going to be able to
differentiate it from reality."	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it... Arusu, are you going to
school with me?"	
Message	Arusu	Yes. It is my role to observe Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	So you're going to be a transfer student?	
Message	Arusu	"The NPCs won't notice me. That is how the system
is set."	
Message	Shido	I don't really get it, but...	
Message	Tonomachi	Yo, Itsuka! Looking the typical amount of dumb～	
Message	Shido	"What's your problem? Did you eat something weird
this morning?"	
Message	Tonomachi	No. I'm 100% perfect, as usual.	
Message	Tonomachi	"I just hate you for always flirting with
Tohka-chan and Tobiichi.
"	
Message	Tonomachi	So that makes me a healthy high school student.	
Message	Shido	I'm not flirting with them...	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Hey, Tonomachi. Can you not see this girl?	
Message	Tonomachi	Huh? Oh, you mean Arusu-san?	
Message	Shido	You know Arusu?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Well yeah, kinda... Oh, I think the bell's about
to ring. Let's do it to it, Itsuka!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Go on ahead.	
Message	Tonomachi	Don't be late～	
Message	Shido	"So he can see Arusu and recognize her... But he
was acting weird. He's not ignoring her, just not
really acknowledging her."	
Message	Arusu	"NPCs recognize me but won't find it odd that I'm
here. And they don't really acknowledge my
presence. That is how the system is designed."	
Message	Shido	"I see... So this Tonomachi was an NPC? It's hard
to tell the difference between him and the real
one... Except that he'd ignore you, Arusu."	
Message	Arusu	"Is it really odd that Hiroto Tonomachi wouldn't
react to me?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, yeah. The moment he sees a pretty girl like
you, he'll make a point of it to find ways to talk
to you."	
Message	Arusu	Pretty... girl?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, do you not know that, either? Uh, it means
like, cute or pretty. Arusu... I guess for your
case it would be cute?"	
Message	Arusu	"Cute... Puppies and babies are cute, right?
Because they look weak?"	
Message	Shido	"Whaat? No, it's not like that... I mean, yes,
puppies and babies are adorable, but... Hm...
How do I explain what cute is...?"	
Message	Arusu	"Cute... Loveable, you should love... Such meaning
is tied to it as well."	
Message	Shido	Exactly, I think you're cute, Arusu.	
Message	Arusu	"I-I'm... cute? Shido Itsuka, do you really think
I'm cute?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Yeah, I do. You're cute, Arusu.	
Message	Arusu	"I-I'm... cute. I should be happy... but I'm also
embarrassed."	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to be embarrassed. I think anyone
who sees you would think you're cute."	
Message	Arusu	Anyone... who sees me?	
Message	Shido	Yes, I'm sure of it!	
Message	Arusu	I see. Understood.	
Message	None	"(Huh... She seemed bummed for some reason.
A reaction like that from Arusu is rather rare.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, the bell just rang. I'm going to class... Are
you coming, too?"	
Message	Arusu	Yes, I will.	
Message	Shido	"Sounds good. I keep forgetting we're inside a game
since everything feels so natural."	
Message	Shido	Oh, crap. Let's hurry.	
Message	Ai	Oh, it's Itsuka-kun. Good morning～	
Message	Mai	Yo, yo. You sure are taking your sweet time～	
Message	Mii	Hey, you! You'd better hurry, or you'll be late!	
Message	Shido	"Same goes for you guys! Why aren't you hurrying
up?"	
Message	Ai	Oh, do you not know?	
Message	Mai	"What a noob analysis, Watson-kun.
Our last names are..."	
Message	Mii	"Do you remember? Hm? Or do you only remember
us as Ai-Mai-Mii? Can you say our full names?
Let's hear it."	
Message	Shido	"G-God, so annoying... Yamabuki, Hazakura,
Fujibakama. Right?"	
Message	Ai	Exactly! I'll give you a candy.	
Message	Mai	"And the answer is pretty clear, Watson-kun. When
they do roll call, I have until "Ha" to get there."	
Message	Mii	But Itsuka-kun, you're "It"!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you mean name order, huh... We don't have very
long before it's us next."	
Message	Ai	Tama-chan takes her time when she does it.	
Message	Mai	"So, the difference between "Ha" and "I" is...
a few minutes!"	
Message	Mii	So vague! Kind of like us!	
Message	Shido	Shut up! Argh, Arusu, let's hurry!	
Message	Arusu	...Okay.	
Message	Tamae	Good morning, Itsuka-kun. You barely made it～	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry, Tama-cha... I mean Okamine-sensei.	
Message	Tamae	"Honestly, you are late. But... Since it looks like you
ran here, so I'll let it slide this time."	
Message	Shido	Thank you!	
Message	Tamae	Hehe... Because...	
Message	Tamae	"Seeing a male high school student running...
sweating, breathing ruggedly..."	
Message	Tamae	 It makes my heart pound.	
Message	None	(Uh, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.)	
Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... It's still morning, but I'm already
exhausted."	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Good morning!	
Message	Origami	...Shido, morning.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Tohka, Origami, morning. Wasn't it confusing
for you guys too, it being morning all of a
sudden?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... No, I'm fine. Kotori explained it to me
before I left home. She told us to just be our
usual selves!"	
Message	Origami	"It's fine on my end as well. I came here to be by
your side, Shido."	
Message	Shido	I see. Thanks, you two...	
Message	Tohka	Leave it to me! I will be the one to protect you!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Arusu	"Thank you... So this is how you use words of
appreciation."	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Arusu	"Thank you" is a phrase of appreciation. When\nsomeone says it to you... it's happy and warm.	
Message	Arusu	...Warm? The heart becomes warm...	
Message	Arusu	"This is mystical... I never thought of things this
way..."	
Message	None	(...The morning classes proceeded normally.)	
Message	None	"(Arusu's seat was one that didn't exist in the
real world, but as she pointed out, no one seemed
to find it odd for her to be there.)"	
Message	Shido	It's lunch break now... Seems like any other day.	
Message	Shido	"Everyone else is supposedly an NPC, but they're
all just like their usual selves."	
Message	Shido	I'm seriously going to forget that I'm in a game.	
Message	Arusu	...	
Message	Tohka	All right, Shido! It's time to eat!	
Message	Shido	"All right, I brought your lunch, Tohka. And yours
too, Arusu."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Then you made more than usual? There's some
for Kotori, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, there's not much difference between making
three or four."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, is that so? That's interesting. I thought you
would have to work more."	
Message	Origami	"Shido, you should eat lunch with me. The presence
of a loud, annoying thing like Tohka Yatogami will
decrease your metabolism and cause you stress."	
Message	Tohka	"Th-That's not true! Shido likes to eat lunch with
me. It makes lunch that much more delicious!"	
Message	Origami	"There are no grounds to support that statement.
If that is in fact accurate, please cite your
sources."	
Message	Tohka	"Hehe... You are quite foolish, Origami Tobiichi!
Listen to me carefully: When I eat with Shido,
lunch tastes more delicious than usual."	
Message	Origami	"That's your point of view and has nothing to do
with Shido. It isn't sufficient enough evidence on
which to base your argument. "	
Message	Tohka	"Sh-Shido feels the same way, too! I know it...
A-Am I wrong... Shido...?"	
Message	Shido	"You're not wrong. It's more fun to eat with people
than to eat alone. And when it's fun, the food
tastes better."	
Message	Tohka	"Hehe. Take that, Origami Tobiichi. That's what
Shido said!"	
Message	Origami	"Shido is just being nice. My focus is on Shido's
emotional and physical health. If needed, I am
willing to do maintenance on him."	
Message	Shido	Maintenance...?	
Message	Origami	"A physical and mental wellness check. Massage...
and things only couples can do."	
Message	Tohka	What? What's that?!	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... The day is at its peak. The sun is full.
Let us enjoy the joys of the afternoon together!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Suggestion. Eat lunch with us.	
Message	Tohka	"Grr, the Yamais came, too! Shido is going to eat
with me."	
Message	Origami	"You came to that conclusion too quickly. We can
pretty much say that it's just Tohka Yatogami's
fantasy."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, okay! Calm down, you guys! Let's all just
eat together!"	
Message	Shido	"Come on, put the desks together. Lunch will taste
much better if we all eat together! These two even
came from another class, you know..."	
Message	Arusu	...Shido Itsuka, I have a question.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Arusu	"...Is this that phrase, fighting over you—also
known as a harem situation?"	
Message	Shido	"Harem?! Well I guess considering the situation,
you could say that, but... No, no, no, it's not
like that!"	
Message	Arusu	"Then shouldn't you decide on only one person?
It appears that they wish for you to do so."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's dumb to fight over something like this.
And besides... like I said earlier, food is best
when eaten as a group."	
Message	Arusu	"I see... The taste of food has a higher priority
over love."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I think that's a different subject... And if
you really think about it, this is just their
usual thing."	
Message	Arusu	Their usual thing...	
Message	None	"(And just like that, our boisterous lunch ended,
and afternoon classes went by as usual.)"	
Message	Shido	Phew... Class is over.	
Message	Shido	"It was rowdy, but I guess it's just like... usual.
I never felt like I was in a gal game at all."	
Message	Shido	But I guess that's good.	
Message	Arusu	Shido Itsuka. Is school over?	
Message	Shido	"Yes, I'm not in any clubs, either. Since this was
just a typical day, was it too boring for you?"	
Message	Arusu	"Boring... I do not understand that. It just...
feels as though something is lacking."	
Message	Shido	Lacking?	
Message	Arusu	"I want to know what love is. Fighting over you in
the afternoon... That was truly intriguing."	
Message	Arusu	"However, you didn't choose any of them. So love
could not be formed. That is what I presume."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't think it's right to pick that moment
specifically..."	
Message	Arusu	"Shido Itsuka. Please tell me your choice. And
could you show me?"	
Message	Shido	Show you... what?	
Message	Arusu	"Something different from usual. Something among
the unusual, would you be able to fall for this
opponent the same way?"	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Arusu	"The shape of love. What is love? Beyond your
choice is an unusual—"	
Message	Shido	Aru...su?
