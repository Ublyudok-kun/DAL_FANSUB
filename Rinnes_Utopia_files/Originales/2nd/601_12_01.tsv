Message	Tohka	Hmmhmmhmmmm ♪	
Message	Shido	You seem cheery, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	"Yes. It's a lovely melody, yes? I heard it for
the first time the other day and fell in love
with it immediately."	
Message	Shido	I see. It is a good song.	
Message	None	"(I can hear Tohka in the kitchen, humming along
to the TV.)"	
Message	None	"(After eating dinner, we've started a nightly
routine of watching TV together.)"	
Message	None	"(Recently Tohka has taken a liking to singing
shows. Ever since this song from an anime hit
the charts, she's become interested.)"	
Message	None	"(She asked some of her friends from school to
show her songs on their phones.)"	
Message	Tohka	Oh. This song is great, too.	
Message	Tohka	Hm. I've never heard it before.	
Message	Tohka	Auu... It makes me want to cry. *sniff*...	
Message	None	"(I personally have been a fan of the show for
a while. I usually know what the rankings are,
and it's nothing to fuss over.)"	
Message	None	"(But for Tohka, it's different. For her, this is
her first time really connecting with music.)"	
Message	None	"(Laughter, tears, feeling the emotions of each
song through Tohka's expressions. I'm almost
jealous at times.)"	
Message	None	"(Even today, her moods sway as she watches
the rankings update.)"	
Message	Tohka	"The lyrics are, "I recall drinking sake with
you, before your final journey." So tragic.
So, so sad."	
Message	None	"(I never knew the Enka genre would chart
that high. That's rare... Just earlier, an idol
group was happily singing and dancing.)"	
Message	None	"(Now, there's a whole new vibe, and a spry,
older man is singing a soulful tune.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka's eyes were glued to the screen,
entranced by his voice.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, do you like Enka?	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. I have never thought about assigning
likes or dislikes to any particular genre."	
Message	Tohka	A good song speaks for itself, really.	
Message	Tohka	"But their talents are undeniable. To be able
to sing with such courage."	
Message	None	(Tohka nodded in succession, clearly impressed.)	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Oh, I get it. Then Tohka, why don't we go
to karaoke? We haven't gone in a while."	
Message	Tohka	Karaoke, eh? A splendid idea!	
Message	None	"(Tohka spun around with a glimmer in her
eye.)"	
Message	Tohka	"We have not gone in some time. I want to go,
Shido!"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, okay. I wanna hear you sing, too. It's
been a while."	
Message	Tohka	"However, will there be songs playing on TV
at the karaoke place?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, lately songs have been added to the
catalogue as soon as they release. I think
we'll be all right."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really?! What a relief!	
Message	None	"(Tohka was overjoyed, showing the enthusiasm
I see in her when she visits one of her favorite
restaurants.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido. So, am I permitted to sing my song?	
Message	Shido	As long as it's available.	
Message	Tohka	Then, the anime song for the wild soul?	
Message	Shido	"Wild... what? Well, I think they've got a lot of
anime songs in there."	
Message	Tohka	"Even the ones sung by the cute idols that make
your heart spark with fervor?"	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What? Um, if the idols are on TV, then I'm
sure they'll be available."	
Message	Tohka	"Even the sake, tears, cherry blossom tornado,
and pinky-promise-gone-awry songs as well?!"	
Message	Shido	You want to sing Enka?!	
Message	None	"(Enka tunes were like folk songs, and there
were tons of 'em! Think classic Japanese songs.
I never thought a young girl would like them.)"	
Message	Shido	Then, our next date will be karaoke!	
Message	Tohka	Got it! I am dizzy with anticipation!	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, karaoke dates are so
vanilla. I'd better think of a way to make it
more special.)"	
Message	Tohka	Ah. It has been a while.	
Message	None	"(On our next day off, as promised, I took
Tohka to karaoke.)"	
Message	None	"(I wanted to go too, of course. As much as I
wanted to sing though, I looked forward to
hearing Tohka sing.)"	
Message	Tohka	OH. I can hear someone singing next door.	
Message	Shido	"It's easy to overhear people from the hallway.
But we'll be singing loudly, too. We won't be
able to hear them from our room."	
Message	Tohka	Very well. Hehe. I'm so excited!	
Message	Shido	"I could see it on your face as soon as we met
up together."	
Message	None	"(The attendant led us to our room, and I froze
upon seeing the accommodations.)"	
Message	Shido	SO BIG!	
Message	None	"(The room was clearly too big for just the two
of us. Well, if they don't have a problem with
it...)"	
Message	Tohka	Come now, Shido. Hurry and sit down.	
Message	Shido	W-Well, this is embarrassing...!	
Message	Tohka	"Why? I wish to sit beside you. It makes me
happy. Quickly now."	
Message	Tohka	Or... do you not wish to sit beside me?	
Message	Shido	"N-No, that's not it. The room is so spacious,
so we don't have to huddle up too close."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. But I feel lonely if the distance is too
great between us. So, you sit here."	
Message	None	"(Ugh! She just says exactly what's on her mind.
If that's what my girlfriend wants, what can I
do?!)"	
Message	Shido	G-Got it...	
Message	None	"(I gave up and sat beside Tohka. Our arms
touched, and I felt her softness next to me.)"	
Message	None	(I can't concentrate...)	
Message	Tohka	All right. Let the singing commence!	
Message	Shido	R-Right. Let's do it.	
Message	None	"(I'm sure once the singing starts, I'll feel all
good. Let's hurry now. That way I can pump
myself up.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, what do you want to sing?	
Message	Tohka	I want to start with a duet!	
Message	Shido	Duet... This early?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes. I-I hear this is typical when going to a
karaoke place with your significant other."	
Message	Shido	I don't think that's necessarily true...	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, really? Why not, though? Surely we will
start off strongly if we perform a duet. I wish
to sing with you, Shido!"	
Message	None	(That's so sweet.)	
Message	Shido	Okay. You're right. Let's choose a duet.	
Message	Tohka	Okay!	
Message	None	"(Tohka was beaming. I handed her the mic and
flipped the switch for her.)"	
Message	Shido	Try singing into the mic. Say AAAH.	
Message	Tohka	AAAH.	
Message	Shido	All right, it's working.	
Message	Shido	For me... Huh? The light isn't turning on.	
Message	Shido	Ahhh. Ahhh.	
Message	None	"(I tried testing out the mic, tapping it once or
twice, but nothing came out of the speaker.)"	
Message	Tohka	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Seems like the mic is broken. It won't
pick up my voice."	
Message	Tohka	"Then, we will simply have to share this mic
together, no?"	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, Tohka pressed the mic into
my face and leaned in close.)"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	"Now, you and I can sing! Come on, input a
selection!"	
Message	Shido	No, we're too close.	
Message	Tohka	"But we are about to perform a duet. How
else is it done if not in close proximity?
What do you mean?"	
Message	Shido	Argh, okay! Fine!	
Message	None	"(I don't think Tohka will let it go. Besides,
I don't want her to have to wait and get
into a sour mood.)"	
Message	None	(I guess I'll sing with her.)	
Message	None	(Which song should we choose?)	
Choice		A soulful anime song.	
Choice		A giddy Idol song ☆	
Choice		Enka, a song of the people.	
Message	Tohka	Oh. It's the song with Aniki and Princess!	
Message	None	"(Tohka gripped my hand tightly as the intense
intro began to play.)"	
Message	None	"(This was the opening theme for a mecha-anime
that Tohka loves. Fans refer to the famous male
and female duo as "Aniki and Princess".)"	
Message	None	(Its melodies moved with fiery passion.)	
Message	Tohka	Nice song selection, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Since you've heard this song a ton of times,
it should be easy to sing, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I will give it my all, so as to not put
Aniki and Princess to shame!"	
Message	None	"(Tohka pumped her fist. Her voice belted as
she followed the words on the screen.)"	
Message	Tohka	Who's that? Hooooot blooood...	
Message	Shido	Tohka, you've got a great voice.	
Message	Tohka	Hehe. I appreciate the compliment, Shido.	
Message	Tohka	"Shido. Don't just sit there, or I will leave you
behind!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, you have a big mouth!	
Message	None	"(Tohka's eyes twinkled with the potential
of a challenge. The song actually pumped
me up. I don't think I could lose!)"	
Message	None	"(As a man, I couldn't possibly fall behind in a
mecha-anime theme song!)"	
Message	Shido	ALL RIIIIGHT!	
Message	Tohka	PUMPED! SOOO PUMPED!	
Message	Shido	"All right. If Tohka is going to sing, it'll be
perfect..."	
Message	None	(As soon as the intro played, Tohka smiled.)	
Message	None	"(It was a hugely popular idol group song.
It practically plays everywhere.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka is a girl after all, so I'm sure these
songs are easier to sing.)"	
Message	Shido	Come on, Tohka! Let loose!	
Message	Tohka	Okay. Then let's perform a duet!	
Message	Shido	Me too?	
Message	None	(But this is a female idol group's song.)	
Message	Tohka	"Tonomachi informed me that this was their
signature song. You recognize it, don't you,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Well, um...	
Message	None	(DAMN YOU, TONOMACHI!)	
Message	Tohka	Oh. Are you unable to sing this song, Shido?	
Message	None	(T-Try not to look too bummed!)	
Message	Shido	"L-Leave it to me! I might not look it, but I
can sing anything! Especially pop songs!
I'm a pro!"	
Message	Tohka	"Really?! Then I can miss a few notes and not
worry!"	
Message	None	(...I feel like I got ahead of myself there.)	
Message	None	(But I can't let Tohka down!)	
Message	None	"(Let's go! I'll give it my all! My confidence is
my ultimate weapon at karaoke!)"	
Message	Shido	"I'll going to steal your heart ♪
I will make it flutter, my darling!"	
Message	None	"(My secret technique... The Shido Itsuka
falsetto!)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hahahaha! Amazing, Shido! Your voice sounds
like a girl's!"	
Message	Shido	This is what I'm capable of!	
Message	None	(...I want to cry.)	
Message	None	"(When the intro started, a blank expression
appeared immediately on Tohka's face.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. What a touching intro. Images of cherry
blossoms on the screen. The kanji for "heart".
A melody so beautiful, yet melancholic."	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka, you sure are somber...	
Message	Tohka	"Such a word is foolish. Shido, what else can
a true singer be?"	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	None	"(I never imagined Tohka to school me on singing
technique... I instinctively apologized.)"	
Message	Tohka	All right, Shido. Try singing.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"(I was pressured by Tohka, who at the moment
was locked in a reverent demeanor, and I began
to sing.)"	
Message	None	"(Enka wasn't something I was good at. At the
moment, I guess I could sing a random song.)"	
Message	None	"(But I regretted the casual air. I was given
a taste of the essence of Enka.)"	
Message	Tohka	YOU FOOL! What are you doing, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	Tohka	"You're not putting your soul into it, Shido!
You'll never capture someone's heart with
that performance!"	
Message	Shido	"B-But what am I supposed to do?! W-Wasn't
this supposed to be a duet?"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, it is because you underestimate Enka.	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, why don't you show me how it's
done, Tohka!"	
Message	Tohka	"Okay, point taken. I will show you how it is
done."	
Message	None	"(Phew. What a relief. Now Tohka will take
the reigns and cut me some slack.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm not sure where all of her preconceptions
about Enka come from, but she'll see how hard
it is.)"	
Message	None	(...I think.)	
Message	Tohka	I am in loooove with you, across the channel～.	
Message	None	"(I fell speechless, lulled by Tohka's sweet,
resonant voice.)"	
Message	Shido	W-Wow! She's amazing...!	
Message	None	"(Amazing. How could this be? Is it even the
same song? My heart is racing. I felt renewed.
Shaken to my core.)"	
Message	None	"(I knew Tohka was a good singer, but not to
this extent...!)"	
Message	Tohka	"Mm...? What is wrong, Shido? Did you get
something in your eyes?"	
Message	Shido	*gasp*... A-Am I crying?	
Message	None	"(Before I knew it, my cheeks were hot and wet
with tears.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, had I moved you to tears? Such an honor.	
Message	Shido	Tohka―no, MAAAAASTEEEEERRRR.!	
Message	Tohka	"Phew. That was quite a singing session.
It was everything I wanted and more!"	
Message	None	"(I have no idea how many songs she sang.
After she was done, Tohka gave a hearty
laugh.)"	
Message	None	"(I had to take a break. My voice was getting
hoarse.)"	
Message	Shido	Why don't we rest?	
Message	Tohka	Sure.	
Message	None	"(I'm parched, so a beverage would be nice.
I reached over to my drink, and I noticed...)"	
Message	Shido	Oh.	
Message	Tohka	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Tohka's lovely face was right in front of mine.
Her wide, sparkling eyes peered into mine in
inviting fashion.)"	
Message	None	"(We had been sharing a mic this whole time.
I could feel her breath tickle my skin.)"	
Message	None	"(My heart skipped a beat. Were we this
close to each other the whole time?)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	"(I wonder why I can't tear my eyes away from
Tohka. Sounds from the speakers played in front
of us, but I could only hear my heartbeat.)"	
Message	None	(Was Tohka's hand this small and soft?)	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido...?	
Message	None	(Tohka's voice squeaked.)	
Message	None	(Her soft lips were inches from mine.)	
Message	A Man's Voice	I LOVE―	
Message	Shido	WHOA!!	
Message	Tohka	AAH!	
Message	None	"(Both of us were startled by a man's
voice being projected at high volume.)"	
Message	None	"(It came from the room next door. I guess
he was in the middle of a love song.)"	
Message	Tohka	K-Karaoke sure is fun, isn't it Shido?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(Tohka stuttered. Crap. I can't look her in
the eye.)"	
Message	Shido	I-I'll get more refreshments!	
Message	Tohka	I-I want tea!	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	None	"(We sang a few more songs before calling it
for the night. Afterwards, we dropped by a
restaurant, ate, then went home.)"	
Message	Tohka	And we're back!	
Message	Shido	Yup. See you tomorrow, okay?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, tomorrow! Today was so fun. I certainly
got my fill of singing."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. Happy to hear it. Oh, I forgot...
Good night, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Good night, Shido.	
Message	None	"(After the door shut, I looked at my trembling
hand. I recalled the feeling of holding the mic
with Tohka. I shook my hand and walked home.)"
