Message	Kotori	Yoshino, are you okay?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... Somehow...	
Message	Yoshino	Aah, they're coming again...! Yah!	
Message	Kotori	"All we can do is defend, huh? We can block
the enemy's attacks if Zadkiel can create a
barrier, but..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmm. None of our attacks are hitting!"	
Message	Yoshino	"Even if... I shoot out ice, i-it goes flying in
another direction."	
Message	Kotori	On top of that, there's too many of them...	
Message	Marina	"Hee hee... What's wrong? For being so haughty,
you're completely useless!"	
Message	Kotori	The hell did you say! Why you, Camael!	
Message	Yoshino	They still won't land...	
Message	Marina	"Such a wild swing couldn't possibly hit me,
now could it?"	
Message	Kotori	...Looks like it's as she says.	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What should we do? At this rate...	
Message	Kotori	I have an idea.	
Message	Yoshinon	"As expected, Kotori-chan!"	
Message	Kotori	"Whatever, just listen. Yoshino, stop making
walls and try to create a radius around us to
deter them."	
Message	Kotori	"Then, I'll unleash a fiery bombardment.
It might take some time to get going, but...
It's all we've got."	
Message	Yoshino	B-But if we do that, the enemy's attacks...	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right! Most likely, you'll paint a\ntarget on your back, Kotori-chan!"	
Message	Kotori	"That can't be helped. We don't have time.
Let's do this!"	
Message	Yoshino	Oogh... O-Okay!	
Message	Kotori	Camael, Meggido!	
Message	Marina	"Hm? Since none of your attacks are landing,
are you just going to fire blind?"	
Message	Yoshino	Freeze!	
Message	Marina	My feet are frozen... Trying to restrain me?	
Message	Kotori	Stop moving, and stay still.	
Message	Marina	How bold of you to make a request.	
Message	Yoshino	K-Kotori-san!	
Message	Marina	She... She stopped all of them!	
Message	Yoshinon	"She even absorbed the attack heading for\nYoshino..."	
Message	Yoshino	K-Kotori-san! The attacks, they're coming!	
Message	Kotori	It's fine. I told you, don't worry about it.	
Message	Marina	"Your body is burning, and regenerating!
So this the healing power of Efreet!"	
Message	Kotori	"It's probably obvious, but it still hurts.
Yoshino! Freeze them up!"	
Message	Yoshino	O-okay! Zadkiel!	
Message	Marina	"Rgh... It can't be! Am I freezing?!
So this is what Hermit is capable of..."	
Message	Yoshino	All of you... Freeze!	
Message	Kotori	Burn, baby, burn!	
Message	Marina	Th-The ice, and fire... All at once!	
Message	Yoshino	Please...! Zadkiel!	
Message	Kotori	Camael!
