Message	Maria	Heehee. Today was very fun.	
Message	Shido	"It was. Let's do it again sometime. Next time,
we can invite others from our group."	
Message	Maria	...Yes.	
Message	None	"(Kotori and the others said they were tired,
so they went home, but... I think they were
just being considerate.)"	
Message	Shido	"What do you want to do, Maria? Should we
stop by some place on our way home?"	
Message	Maria	"Shido, would it be okay for me to have
some alone time today?"	
Message	Shido	Hm. Is there something on your mind?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I would like to organize my thoughts
a bit. Is that fine?"	
Message	Shido	"All right. Just make sure you're not out
too late."	
Message	Maria	"Thank you for your concern, but I will be
okay. It is not like there is any danger here."	
Message	Shido	Got it. If anything happens, call me.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Then, Shido... I will see you.	
Message	None	"(I watched Maria go until I could no longer
see her.)"	
Message	None	"(Since I'm out here, I'll take my time
walking home.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hm... Is that Arusu? What is she doing,
standing next to the sidewalk like that?"	
Message	None	"(The black-clothed Arusu stood there
nonchalantly. Maybe she's waiting for
someone.)"	
Message	Shido	"Actually, what does she normally do at
this time of day?"	
Message	None	"(I pondered the question while watching Arusu,
then she suddenly crossed the sidewalk.)"	
Message	Shido	What is she doing? Wait, that's...	
Message	None	"(Opposite of Arusu, an old lady was walking
along the crosswalk. However, she stopped
because she carried heavy shopping bags.)"	
Message	Arusu	Good grief. Must you do this in front of me?	
Message	None	"(Arusu approached the old woman, grabbed
her bags, and continued walking.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, you can't just leave her there!	
Message	Shido	"Um. Are you all right? If you'd like, I can
take your hand."	
Message	None	"(The old woman nodded and grabbed my
hand.)"	
Message	Shido	"The girl over there is looking after your
bags. Here, right this way."	
Message	Shido	"You were trying to help that old lady, weren't
you? Looks like you have a good side after all."	
Message	Arusu	"It would have ruined my mood if she were
to die in front of me. Even NPCs bleed, after
all."	
Message	None	"(The old woman bowed her head, and left
with a smile on her face. Arusu, however,
seemed displeased.)"	
Message	Shido	You did a good thing. Don't make that face.	
Message	Arusu	"I didn't help her because I wanted to.
I just remembered you getting upset with
me last time, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Hm? When was I angry at you?	
Message	None	(Something's nagging at me...)	
Message	Arusu	"There is no reason for you to understand.
This conversation is over, got it?"	
Message	Shido	I don't.	
Message	Arusu	...Huh?	
Message	Arusu	Wh-What are you doing?!	
Message	Shido	"Well, you did something good. I thought
you deserved some praise."	
Message	Arusu	I told you, it wasn't like...	
Message	Shido	Even so.	
Message	Arusu	...!	
Message	Arusu	"Enough! I'll say it again. That was not my
intention. This is beyond the point of
misunderstanding."	
Message	Shido	Then, fine. It's a misunderstanding.	
Message	Arusu	Excuse me?!	
Message	Shido	It's fine. I just want to praise you.	
Message	Arusu	"Very well. I cannot stop you.
But why do you feel the need? I do not
understand."	
Message	Shido	"Typically good things are rewarded with
praise. This should be expected."	
Message	Arusu	Huh? Is that so?	
Message	Arusu	"Are you satisfied yet? I have no business
with you, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	That kind of hurts, you know...	
Message	Arusu	"Oh, there is something. Something I wish
to ask."	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Arusu	"Who is the first person a child receives
praise from?"	
Message	Shido	Umm. Their parents, I guess.	
Message	Arusu	Right. Of course. That is why I am doing this.	
Message	Shido	What did you say...?	
Message	Arusu	Nothing. See you, Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	There she goes again...	
Message	None	"(Arusu's parting expression was melancholy,
but it could have been my imagination.)"	
Message	Shido	"I guess I'll head home. If Arusu's out, then
Maria must be home too."
