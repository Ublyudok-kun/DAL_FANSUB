Message	Shido	M...Mmm... *yawn*... It's morning.	
Message	Shido	"Ah... It's been a while since I woke up
so peacefully."	
Message	Shido	"No one is jumping on top of me, no one is sleeping
next to me, and no one is yelling at me..."	
Message	Shido	"No, wait... Maybe that's supposed to be normal.
I shouldn't think about it... It'll only make me
sadder."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I'm waking up later than usual? Today is...
Oh, that's right, it's the weekend."	
Message	Shido	"Then Kotori and the others aren't up yet. I guess
I can go make breakfast."	
Message	Maria	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, good morning. Wait... This smell.
It smells good."	
Message	None	(Ohh?! There's food ready on the table.)	
Message	None	"(Toast, omelettes... potatoes and sausage. The
salad has a lot of ingredients. It's pretty
well-made.)"	
Message	Kotori	You're late, Shido. We've already started.	
Message	Tohka	"Mmm! So good! The sausage and potato thing is
truly a great combination. Who came up with this?"	
Message	Kotori	...Uh, the Germans, maybe?	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really?! Then the Germans are amazing!	
Message	Miku	"Let's be sure to praise Arusu-san for making it!
This is amazing."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah, you did very well! Good job, Arusu!	
Message	Maria	Thank... you.	
Message	Tohka	Mm! I want more!	
Message	Maria	Yes. Understood. I will bring some over.	
Message	Shido	"Everyone's gathered from the morning.
Tohka, Miku and—"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... I heeded the summon of the bell. It's
not so bad, surrounding yourself with people to
eat with from time to time."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Concur. We received a phone call saying they made a
lot and needed people to eat it. It's our day off,
so there was no reason for us to say no."	
Message	Shido	Wait... Maria, did you call them?	
Message	Kurumi	It seems like it. I too received an invite.	
Message	Shido	Maria... You've changed a little.	
Message	Kurumi	"I agree. She's become a lot more human-like. It's
hard to imagine her like this, knowing the way she
was before."	
Message	None	"(The "other Arusu" was human-like from the
get-go... I think. Her expressions and emotions
were more apparent than Maria's...)"	
Message	None	"(But... yesterday when she erased Tonomachi, that
other "Arusu" was laughing. It was an emotion, but
definitely not human-like.)"	
Message	None	"(If that Arusu is the real one, and Maria is a
fake, then would she eventually end up like
that Arusu? But—)"	
Message	Maria	Here you go, Tohka Yatogami. Here is more.	
Message	Tohka	"Oh! I was waiting for this! Mm...! What is this?!
There's cheese on top! This is amazing!"	
Message	Maria	"I heard this is called cheese toast. It may appear
as pizza toast without any condiments, but it is
said that cheese toast has its benefits as well."	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I understand! The simplicity of the cheese
melted on toast... It's... hard to explain, but...
delicious!"	
Message	Yoshino	...This salad... is very delicious, too.	
Message	Yoshinon	"It's so colorful and beautiful!"	
Message	Origami	"It contains many vitamins and amino acids, and the
balance of minerals is great. It's a very logical
combination."	
Message	Tohka	"What? What's more important is that it's
delicious! Despite it being a salad, there's
chicken in it, and I'm so happy!"	
Message	Origami	"It's important for protein intake. And if it's
protein that you like, then—"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! I just felt a chill go down my spine!
Origami, I don't know what you're about to
say, but please don't say any more!"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways... did you make all of this on your own,
Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It took me longer to cook than when you made
it. But I made too much in preparation of Tohka
Yatogami's presence. I still lack experience."	
Message	Shido	"No, I think you did a good job.
That's amazing, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Thank you... Shido.	
Message	Maria	"I just executed the instructions of a recipe. If
you praise me so much... I'll blush."	
Message	Shido	Good job. You sure did me a favor.	
Message	None	(I put my hand on Maria's head and patted it.)	
Message	Maria	Oh...	
Message	Maria	...You patted my head.	
Message	None	"(Yeah, what happened on the rooftop yesterday was
bad, but this Arusu—Maria—I'll trust. She's not a
bad girl. She may just have a split personality.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hey. Shido! Pat me, too!	
Message	Shido	Huh? Sure, I guess—	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami didn't do anything. She just sat
there and ate mindlessly."	
Message	Origami	"On the other hand, I prepared the place settings
and portioned out the food. I assisted more than
she did, so Shido, you should pat me."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...? I-If it's all right... Umm... me, too...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino helped the most! I would say she was the\nmost cooperative with Arusu-chan. So be sure to\npat her head, too!"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't mind, but if you all come at me at
once..."	
Message	Miku	How lucky～ Darling, pat me too! Do it a lot!	
Message	Kaguya	N-Not fair! Me too...!	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Please pat Yuzuru as well.	
Message	Kurumi	"That sure sounds fun. I would like a pat as well.
Or else I will be really sad. I might cry."	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, cut it out! Isn't it obvious that such a
right belongs to the little sister?!"	
Message	Shido	"You guys, don't all ask for it at once! Don't
charge at me! Argh! Let me eat my breakfast
in peace!"	
Message	Maria	...Is love to be patted on the head?	
Message	Shido	"Uh, I don't think so... Gosh... you guys are so
loud so early! Just sit down and eat your food!"	
Message	Maria	...I feel like I lost.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Lost?	
Message	Maria	"I was the one that was patted on the head. But
then I was only one of many."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, sorry... They're so noisy.	
Message	Maria	Shido... You idiot.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Maria	...Nothing.	
Message	None	"(Did she just call me an idiot...? No, I must have
heard wrong.)"	
Message	None	"(The ruckus doesn't seem to end. Today will be
another crazy day...)"
