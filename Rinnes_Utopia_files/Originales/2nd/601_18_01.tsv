Message	None	"(I was in the middle of an evening walk
when I stopped myself in my tracks.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked up at the sky. Man, the stars were
mesmerizing tonight. But the sight made me
feel even lonelier.)"	
Message	None	"(In the silence of night, I opened my heavy
mouth.)"	
Message	Shido	This is it, Tohka.	
Message	None	"(Tohka was staring at the floor, but she
gasped as she looked up.)"	
Message	Tohka	What...? Why? WHY, SHIDO?!	
Message	None	"(Her eyes flashed from bewilderment.
I watched as her lips trembled, and the
color began to drain from her face.)"	
Message	None	"(She must be in shock. If I could, I wanted
to hug and comfort her.)"	
Message	None	"(But all I could do was shake my head
weakly.)"	
Message	Shido	"I hope you understand. You're not a child,
anymore."	
Message	Tohka	NO! I don't want to!	
Message	Tohka	"I cannot bear the thought of us breaking
apart!"	
Message	None	"(Her anguished cries pierced through me.
I gritted my teeth.)"	
Message	Shido	I don't want to break up either, but...!	
Message	None	"(I cut myself off, knowing there wasn't
anything else to say. Not in one breath.)"	
Message	None	(The cruel truth. It was impossible to say.)	
Message	Tohka	"Please. Don't, Shido. I do not wish to hear it!
I would rather hear nothing at all!"	
Message	Shido	No. Plugging your ears won't change anything.	
Message	None	"(My throat croaked, squeezing the last
word out of my mouth.)"	
Message	Shido	This is the point of no return!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	(Tohka tightly gripped my shirt.)	
Message	None	"(Her hand trembled, her eyes shaking from
fury, fighting back tears.)"	
Message	None	"(I... I bit my lips once again. I felt helpless,
but Tohka finally spoke up.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, after all we have been through...	
Message	None	(Tohka's eyes glimmered like a warm hearth.)	
Message	Tohka	"Hey, Shido. Do you remember? When we went
shopping for winter clothes?"	
Message	Shido	Yes, I do...	
Message	Tohka	You bought me a scarf and shoes.	
Message	Shido	Right. They looked lovely on you.	
Message	Tohka	I heard you were reprimanded for that.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Because of that, I had to buy fewer
ingredients for dinner, and Kotori yelled
at me."	
Message	None	"(The thought of it sends a shiver down my
spine. Our meal was so sparse that Kotori
treated me with sub-zero contempt.)"	
Message	Shido	For me, it was all worth it! I made you happy!	
Message	None	"(I balled my hand into a fist, and shook
it away from her.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...! You said you cared about me...!	
Message	None	"(Tohka covered her mouth, trying to resist
the urge to cry.)"	
Message	None	"(Oh. Tohka knows my pain. She's trying to
heal the wounds my heart has endured. This
alone was enough.)"	
Message	None	(I shared a warm smile with her.)	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Tohka. Remember when we went to
karaoke? We held the mic together."	
Message	Tohka	Yes. We performed a duet with one mic.	
Message	Shido	"So many cherished memories. I remember
them like they were yesterday."	
Message	Tohka	We went several times afterward.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I still love your singing voice, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	"You flatter me, but it came from plenty of
practice, you know?"	
Message	Tohka	"I memorized so many of the songs you told
me you liked. Hopefully one day, I can show
you."	
Message	Tohka	Then, I will perform inside of a grand arena!	
Message	Shido	Haha. An arena concert, huh...?)	
Message	None	"(An unattainable dream. I fight the urge
to laugh at its absurdity.)"	
Message	None	"(But I won't laugh at her. I would never
laugh at Tohka.)"	
Message	Shido	"I can't wait. You know I'll be there to watch
you."	
Message	None	"(Suddenly, something hot slid down my
throat, choking me up. I cough, and drop
to my knees.)"	
Message	Shido	Rgh! *cough, cough*!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Are you okay?!	
Message	None	(Tohka rubbed my back.)	
Message	None	"(I huffed in pain, breathily describing a
scene to Tohka.)"	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, you also like playing with animals,
right? I even thought if I had bought a dog,
every day could've been an adventure."	
Message	Shido	"A white house along the beach, with a big
yard. You're running around, chasing the
dog on the lawn."	
Message	None	"(Another dream left unfulfilled. I'm sure
it would've made a funny story, but I know
it would never happen.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka laughing from joy, cuddling up next
to her precious dog. A sight I never would
have tired of seeing.)"	
Message	None	"(A memory... paired with the sight of Tohka,
sitting tearfully before me. Which is the
dream? Which is reality?)"	
Message	None	(I don't even know anymore.)	
Message	Tohka	"Me too. I wish to adopt a dog with you.
We can pet its fur, and teach it new tricks."	
Message	None	"(My throat tightened. I fought the urge to
spit up. No, there's something I still need
to tell Tohka...!)"	
Message	None	"(My vision blurred, my eyes hot from tears.
Damn it...! I can't see!)"	
Message	None	"(Don't...let me see Tohka's face... At least,
not until the very end...)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Please, understand. I don't... I don't want things
to end this way, either."	
Message	Shido	But... I have to.	
Message	None	"(The time has come to make a decision.
I stood up, and took a deep breath.)"	
Message	None	"(I put my hand on Tohka's thin shoulder.
Her face was so gentle, round but soft.)"	
Message	None	(I looked into her teary, crystal eyes.)	
Message	Shido	I can't be with you anymore.	
Message	None	"(The words wretched out of my mouth
like blood.)"	
Message	Shido	So, I have to say good-bye, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What...?	
Message	None	"(The color left Tohka's eyes, overshadowed
by a thick, burgeoning mist.)"	
Message	None	(The air froze, much like Tohka's heart.)	
Message	None	(She became pale, and her voice shook.)	
Message	Tohka	Do you really have to...?	
Message	Shido	I do.	
Message	Tohka	You really, really have to?	
Message	Shido	I really, really have to!	
Message	Tohka	But do you really, really, really have to?!	
Message	Shido	I REALLY REALLY REALLY HAVE TO!	
Message	Shido	"Don't give me that look, Tohka! Don't
look at me that way!"	
Message	None	"(Through gritted teeth, I averted my gaze
away from Tohka. Try as I might, I couldn't.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka looked like a woman, lost. She clutched
the sleeve of my shirt, refusing to let go, as if
it would cost her life.)"	
Message	Tohka	No. I would do anything not to leave you...	
Message	Tohka	Shido, I want to be with you...!	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Tohka	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Tohka.	
Message	None	(We spoke each other's names.)	
Message	Tohka	Shido!	
Message	Shido	Tohka!	
Message	None	(We spread our arms.)	
Message	Tohka	SHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	
Message	Shido	TOOOOOOOHKAAAAA!	
Message	None	"(We didn't care who saw or heard us.
We screamed as loud as lungs would let
us, and we engaged in tender embrace.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, like I said, this as far as I can see you
off."	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Shido	"You have school tomorrow, so you need to
go home."	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Shido	And I need to go home, too.	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Shido	"I need to do homework, and prepare tomorrow's
lunch. You understand, don't you?"	
Message	Tohka	*gulp*...	
Message	Shido	Don't think about food right now.	
Message	Shido	"You live right next to me, so when you go
outside, we'll be there."	
Message	Shido	That's why we must part here.	
Message	Shido	You understand, right? Right?	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	(Tohka pouted, so I repeated myself.)	
Message	None	"(How many times have we had this talk?
I'm tired of it by now.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, where's my answer?	
Message	Tohka	...*whimper*.	
Message	Shido	There's no point whimpering. No.	
Message	Tohka	BOOO.	
Message	Shido	No pouting, either.	
Message	Tohka	GRRR!	
Message	Shido	JUST TALK!	
Message	None	(Tohka shifted her eyes.)	
Message	Tohka	I know. I know, but...	
Message	None	"(Her body language was that of a petulant
child's.)"	
Message	Tohka	I DO NOT WANT TO!	
Message	Shido	What are you, a child...?	
Message	None	"(In her frustration, Tohka gripped me tighter.
My sleeves were almost entirely wrinkled.)"	
Message	None	"(This is how Tohka gets whenever we part.
She is so reluctant to do so that she has to
partake in melodrama to get through it.)"	
Message	None	"(It could be my fault too. Since we are the
type to revel in being a lovey-dovey couple.)"	
Message	Tohka	"How heartless can you be, to say good-bye
to me so easily, Shido?"	
Message	None	"(Finally, she turns to face me, and asks me
directly.)"	
Message	Shido	"Why? That's a normal thing to say. When you
go home, you say good-bye."	
Message	Shido	"Just like when you say good-bye to your
classmates at school."	
Message	Tohka	I say, "See you tomorrow."	
Message	Shido	There's no difference...	
Message	None	"(Nevertheless, Tohka was dissatisfied with
my answer.)"	
Message	Tohka	"I cannot bring myself to say good-bye so
easily."	
Message	None	"(Tohka wore a grim expression. More serious
than I had ever seen her.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Because good-bye means you will never see
each other again, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"There is a finality to it. If I say good-bye, then
I cannot see you until the next day."	
Message	Tohka	I do not like it...	
Message	Tohka	"I do not want to go a single day or night
without you. In truth, the thought of not
seeing you is torture. Utter despair."	
Message	Tohka	Good-bye is a lonesome greeting. Am I wrong?	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	None	"(Her reasoning was unexpectedly sound.
I scratched my cheek.)"	
Message	None	"(In truth, I found it touching that she
thought so highly of me.)"	
Message	Shido	"I mean, I'm lonely too. If I could be with you
all the time, I would be."	
Message	Tohka	...Really?	
Message	Shido	"Of course. That's why I can't fault you for
hating to say good-bye."	
Message	Tohka	"Then, when why do you inflict this cruelty
upon me by saying good-bye...?"	
Message	Shido	"Because I have faith that we will see each
other tomorrow, too."	
Message	None	(Tohka blinked twice in quick succession.)	
Message	Shido	"I can see you tomorrow, and the day after.
It's not something you need to worry about."	
Message	Shido	"We can have dinner again tomorrow, then go
on another date."	
Message	Shido	That's why... I say good-bye.	
Message	Tohka	Can I see you tomorrow? Is that a certainty?	
Message	Shido	"Yes, it is certain. I want to see you, Tohka.
Do you not feel the same?"	
Message	Tohka	...!	
Message	Tohka	"Of course not! I want to see you tomorrow,
and the following day! I never wish to be apart!"	
Message	Shido	"Right? Then we can see each other again
tomorrow."	
Message	Shido	Good-bye means, "I'll see you again," too.	
Message	Tohka	"I see. So even we say good-bye, then we
will reunite soon."	
Message	Tohka	"No... When I say good-bye, it is a reminder
that I get to be with you again!"	
Message	Tohka	"If I think of it in those terms, I can never be
afraid of good-bye again! Not a bad idea!"	
Message	Tohka	"I can see you tomorrow, and the following
day. That is what you're promising, right
Shido?"	
Message	Tohka	"I want to see you many times. A hundred
times. A thousand times!"	
Message	None	(Her smile stretched from ear to ear.)	
Message	None	"(Getting to see me. To Tohka, that is the
greatest pleasure in the world.)"	
Message	None	"(With that, she has enough hope to carry
on to the next day.)"	
Message	None	"(That is how precious our time is to her.
How could that not make me happy?)"	
Message	Tohka	I can see you tomorrow, right Shido?	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Tohka	And the day after, too?	
Message	Shido	"Tomorrow, the following day, the day after that,
and the day after that. We will say good-bye and
reunite until the end of time."	
Message	Tohka	I see. Then I will be okay!	
Message	None	(The brightness returned to Tohka's voice.)	
Message	None	"(This was the true Tohka. I don't like the
thought of her being gloomy.)"	
Message	Shido	Then I'll see you tomorrow, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Okay! See you tomorrow, Shido!	
Message	None	"(We said good-bye and waved, but it is not
a permanent separation.)"	
Message	Shido	Let's meet again tomorrow, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	"Okay, Shido. Tomorrow, the following day.
Good-bye is never forever."	
Message	Shido	Right!	
Message	None	"(We reunite, we talk, we date. Repeating
the cycle that follows each good-bye.)"	
Message	None	"(Even so, we'll never be apart. So long
as we promise to be in each other's lives.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, good-bye!	
Message	None	"(Good-bye doesn't have to mean separation.
It is a precursor to the beauty of a reunion,
when your beloved re-enters your life.)"
