Message	Shido	I wonder what love is...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Shido-san... You sure are in deep thought.	
Message	Shido	"Oh... It's just... We need to know what it means,
or else we're stuck in this world."	
Message	Shido	"For example... Kurumi, if you had a boyfriend,
what would you expect from him?"	
Message	Kurumi	My, that is quite a brazen question to ask a lady.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Sorry.	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe, I don't mind. But, hm... I don't like to be
held down."	
Message	Shido	I see. That seems very like you.	
Message	Kurumi	Am I... really?	
Message	Shido	I mean you're like a phantom, you know?	
Message	Kurumi	So that's how you see me, huh?	
Message	Shido	Well... it's true, isn't it?	
Message	Kurumi	Heh. Then let's keep it that way.
