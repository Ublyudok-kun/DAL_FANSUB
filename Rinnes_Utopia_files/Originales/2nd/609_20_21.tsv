Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. These fake Spirits... However,
with their numbers, they are proving to
be an issue."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. Also, our attacks are veering
off course because of the spatial manipulation."	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh heh... Are you scared? You can step
down, Yuzuru."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. Kaguya, you are the one diving
and weaving away from danger, let alone
out of breath. You should take a rest."	
Message	Kaguya	Wha, I-I'm not out of breath at all!	
Message	Yuzuru	Doubt. Staaaaare...	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehehe. This is merely an omen of destruction.
My Storm Lance, the arbiter of tornadoes, is
engaging in some foreplay as I pierce through her."	
Message	Yuzuru	Laughter. Storm Lance (lol).	
Message	Kaguya	D-Don't laugh!	
Message	Marina	Hee hee. You seem awfully confident.	
Message	Marina	"Although the both of you will be vanquished
soon."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Issue. At this rate, our odds for victory will
diminish, Kaguya."	
Message	Kaguya	"I'm of the same mind. Originally, I thought
the ones we destroyed were it, but..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Alignment. I had the same idea.	
Message	Kaguya	"If we are at this point, we have no choice but
to unleash the Yamai forbidden power."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Inquiry. Do you mean to suggest that, alone, we
stand no chance, so we should work together?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh. Heh... Foolish. Isn't that...
That's not what I...
"	
Message	Kaguya	That's not exactly what I meant.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Proposal. I believe this is the most opportune
time for us to cooperate. Let us wipe them out
with one strike."	
Message	Kaguya	Yes, you're right! Let's go, Yuzuru!	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreement. Charge, Kaguya!	
Message	Kaguya	Yes. For Shido's sake. Raphael... El Re'em!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. And for everyone else's sakes,
too. Raphael... Ell Na'ash!"	
Message	Kaguya	Here we go, Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	Response. Right beside you, Kaguya.	
Message	Marina	Is this what Berserk's Angel is capable of?!	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... I can feel it. The Yamai Sisters
combining into one. As long as Yuzuru is
here, I am the strongest."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. It is the opposite. I am the strongest
when Kaguya is here."	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. We Yamai Sisters are two in one.
Therefore, we cannot lose!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. There is nothing the Yamai
Sisters cannot penetrate!"	
Message	Marina	I won't allow it!	
Message	Kaguya	Protect, cloak of gales!	
Message	Marina	"Rgh... They're shielding themselves with
wind...!"	
Message	Kaguya	Now, let's go Yuzuru! My other half!	
Message	Yuzuru	Response. Combined into one, the Yamais...	
Message	Kaguya・Yuzuru	Raphael... El Kanaph!	
Message	Marina	AAAAAAAH!
