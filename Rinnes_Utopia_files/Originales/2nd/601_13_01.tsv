Message	Tohka	Ohh...	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tohka. Tohka-saaaaan?	
Message	Tohka	Hrngh...	
Message	Shido	No use. She can't hear me at all.	
Message	None	"(She's been stuck at a glass window for the
past thirty minutes, staring at cute animals
in a pet shop.)"	
Message	Tohka	"It is so fluffy.. Look how many fluffy things
there are!"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, it's moving...	
Message	Tohka	It ran. Oh, it fell!	
Message	Tohka	...It rolled up into a ball.	
Message	Tohka	"Aw, cute. They are so precious, don't you
think, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Watching them is therapeutic.	
Message	Tohka	Yes, for me as well!	
Message	None	"(Tohka was staring at a litter of puppies
playing with one another inside of an
enclosure, rolling around.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka began mimicking the puppies,
beginning to roll around on the floor.)"	
Message	Tohka	Ohh... Ohhh...	
Message	None	"(When the dogs go right, she goes right.
If they go left, she goes left. She is in total
sync with the pups.)"	
Message	None	"(It was pretty entertaining to watch from
behind her.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, look. They are so cute.	
Message	Shido	Let's see.	
Message	None	"(I peeked inside the window, and a puppy
jumped.)"	
Message	Shido	Wow. They look like plushies.	
Message	Tohka	I know, I know! Ahh, so cute...	
Message	None	"(Tohka's eyes were entranced. She was
utterly attached to the pups.)"	
Message	None	"(I didn't know she had a soft spot for puppies.
We just happened to pass the pet shop.)"	
Message	None	"(The only other time her eyes sparkle like
this is when she's gazing at food samples.)"	
Message	None	"(I guess to her, food and pets occupy the
same plane of worship.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? They ceased moving, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	None	"(I looked once more at the puppies. One was
face down, and the other was belly up, lying
beside its sibling.)"	
Message	Shido	Sounds like nap time to me.	
Message	Shido	"I think they're sleeping? I mean, they say
puppies spend most of their day napping.
I bet they're tired from playing so much."	
Message	Tohka	I see. Aww. That is too bad.	
Message	None	"(Tohka stepped back away from the pet shop
quietly. Keeping one eye fixed on the puppies,
she took gentle steps to not wake them.)"	
Message	Shido	Satisfied?	
Message	Tohka	I am good for today, but I wish to return.	
Message	Shido	Sure. We'll come back soon.	
Message	Tohka	Okay.	
Message	Tohka	So long, friends.	
Message	None	"(She bid the showcase farewell, and waved
her hand. The puppies likely didn't hear her,
but they responded with a yawn.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hehe.	
Message	None	"(She seemed entertained. Maybe we could
take a zoo trip someday.)"	
Message	Shido	Ah. It's a nice day.	
Message	None	"(We sat on a bench and stretched out our
hands and feet.)"	
Message	Tohka	Yes. The weather is perfect. So temperate.	
Message	Shido	"A laidback day like this is just what I need
now and then."	
Message	None	(Tohka responded with a kind smile.)	
Message	None	"(Today, we didn't have anything specific
planned for our date. We walked around the
shopping district and entered random shops.)"	
Message	None	"(The pet shop was one of them. We chose
it on a whim, but it left an impression.)"	
Message	None	"(The park was a perfect follow-up. We
basked in the sunshine together.)"	
Message	None	"(Can't take ordinary days like this for
granted. I'm getting emotional thinking
about it.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, look. There is a dog over there!	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh, you're right.	
Message	None	"(Just below us on the path, someone was
walking their dog.)"	
Message	None	"(It was relatively big, wagging its tail as it
trotted beside its owner.)"	
Message	Tohka	Lucky. It looks friendly and fluffy.	
Message	Shido	Do you want a pet, Tohka? Like a dog?	
Message	Tohka	Yes. Having a pet looks delightful.	
Message	Shido	"It seems like you enjoyed yourself at the
pet store."	
Message	Tohka	I only wish to snuggle with a large dog.	
Message	Tohka	"I want to take naps with it, perhaps throw
a branch and play fetch."	
Message	Shido	"What about pets that are easier to take care
of? Like a hamster or parakeet? I hear some
people keep turtles or iguanas as pets, too."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really? Were they at the pet shop as well?	
Message	Shido	"Probably. They're small, so I bet they kept
them in the back."	
Message	None	"(The larger pets are placed towards the front
of the store. Tohka was so enthralled that I'm
sure she didn't notice.)"	
Message	Tohka	So pets come in a variety, do they?	
Message	Tohka	"Hamsters are small and cute, and parakeets
are birds. Enticing options, indeed. In an
emergency, they can be last-resort meals."	
Message	Shido	"You better not eat your pets. Promise me
you won't."	
Message	None	"(I like to think she's kidding, but knowing
Tohka, there might be a kernel of truth in
there. I need to keep an eye out...)"	
Message	Tohka	"I was thinking that neither turtles nor iguanas
have hair. They don't qualify as fluffy, do they?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah. You've got a point. If you want a fluffy
pet, then those options wouldn't work."	
Message	None	"(If she wants to cuddle fur, then it has to
be a dog or a cat. Guess she's not too into
reptiles.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder what kind of dog owner she would
be. Tohka's as bubbly and sociable as a dog.)"	
Message	None	"(If they're together, they might mesh well and
go on walks every day. But I could also see them
clashing, getting into rowdy arguments.)"	
Message	None	"(Regardless, that sounds fun. Maybe it's
worth looking into a dog.)"	
Message	Shido	Hm? It's coming this way.	
Message	Tohka	...Really?!	
Message	None	(The dog pranced towards us.)	
Message	None	"(Its owner seemed to be chatting with an
acquaintance, and the dog grew bored.)"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, this one is friendly. Come hither.	
Message	None	"(Tohka beckoned to it, and the dog neared.
It seemed accustomed to people.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka let out a small, welcoming squeal
as she pet the dog. It merely sat there,
calmly enjoying the attention.)"	
Message	Tohka	It's so fluffy. I like how it feels, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"That's nice. It doesn't even bark. What a
good dog."	
Message	None	"(I reached out to the dog as Tohka had,
and it licked my hand.)"	
Message	None	"(As I pet its head, it wagged its tail. It really
was a cute dog.)"	
Message	Tohka	"All right. This is as good of an opportunity
as ever to train it."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, are you serious? Train it? How would
you do that, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Leave it to me. Watch and learn, Shido.	
Message	None	"(She seemed so confident, but I doubt Tohka
had ever trained a dog before. She must have
gotten her info from TV. I hope she's okay...)"	
Message	Tohka	Here I go. Shake!	
Message	None	"(*shake*! The dog did as it was commanded,
and offered its paw.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoaaaaaa, amazing!	
Message	Tohka	Sit!	
Message	None	"(*sit*! It placed its bottom on the grass,
almost showing off how prompt it was.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, that's amazing!	
Message	Tohka	Do three aerial galaxy twists!	
Message	Shido	That's too much!	
Message	Shido	NO WAAAAAAY!	
Message	None	"(It was a perfect somersault. If there were
judges, they'd award the dog a perfect 10.
Was this dog raised in a circus?)"	
Message	Tohka	Ah! What a smart dog!	
Message	None	"(Tohka was elated, and the dog responded
well to its praise, pressing its collar against
Tohka when―)"	
Message	None	(It dove its nose into Tohka's skirt.)	
Message	Tohka	Ah... H-Hey!	
Message	Shido	Wha, wha, wha?!	
Message	Tohka	W-Wait, my skirt is going to flip!	
Message	None	"(Tohka tried to press her skirt down, but
dog was unrelenting.)"	
Message	None	"(Her thighs were becoming exposed.
Oh, no! Tohka's in trouble!)"	
Choice		Help her.	
Choice		Sit and watch.	
Message	Tohka	"Sh-Shido! Why are you just sitting there?!
Help me!"	
Message	None	"(She didn't have to ask twice. I put my body
in between Tohka and the dog.)"	
Message	Shido	There, there.	
Message	None	"(I pet its head and its neck. The dog groaned
from comfort.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka used this opportunity to hide behind
me.)"	
Message	Tohka	*whimper*...	
Message	Shido	"Don't glare at it. It just wanted to play with
you."	
Message	Tohka	Shido, did you see it...?	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	None	"(I couldn't deny it. Tohka's skin was pale
white.)"	
Message	Tohka	Aww...	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Er...	
Message	Tohka	Whoa!	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, the dog barked and Tohka
jumped on me! All right... Great timing!)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido! Is it coming for me again?	
Message	None	(Huh? Did that... traumatize her?)	
Message	Shido	Go, get back. Your owner's waiting for you.	
Message	None	"(The dog cocked its head, so I shooed it
towards its owner. After a few minutes,
the dog understood what I was doing.)"	
Message	None	"(It ran back to its owner, periodically looking
back at us in the distance.)"	
Message	Shido	Haha. That dog had a lot of personality.	
Message	None	"(I was sad to say good-bye, so I waved at it.
The owner acknowledged me with a bow.)"	
Message	Tohka	Yes. It did, but...	
Message	Shido	But?	
Message	Tohka	"The dog appeared cute, but I had a feeling that
it was eyeing my skirt from the start."	
Message	Shido	No, I don't think that's the case.	
Message	Tohka	Oh, then if you say so.	
Message	None	(Looks like Tohka was shaken up by it.)	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido! Don't just watch! Do something!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but...	
Message	None	"(The dog buried its head up Tohka's skirt.
If I were to get in between them, I'd have
to hop in front of Tohka, but...)"	
Message	None	"(That would also mean I'd have to look
up her skirt.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hey, where are you licking?! HYAH!	
Message	Tohka	Aah... N-No. Not there...	
Message	None	(What the―?! This is getting weird!)	
Message	Tohka	C-Cut it...	
Message	Tohka	AAAAAH!	
Message	Tohka	Aah... MMM...	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka!!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... Do something.	
Message	Shido	I-I'll save you now!	
Message	Tohka	Hey. Stop it. It tickles... AAAAU!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka!!	
Message	None	"(She became weak from being tickled, and
I rushed to catch her. It was close.)"	
Message	Tohka	Y-You should've helped me sooner...	
Message	None	(She looked at me drearily, and I gulped.)	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... Are you okay?	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Shido	I guess it was a little too playful.	
Message	None	"(I pat the dog's head. It seemed satisfied,
and wagged its tail. Little guy didn't have
a care in the world.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I think it just wanted to play. Go on.
Go back to your master."	
Message	None	"(I called at the dog, and it cooed before
walking over to its owner.)"	
Message	Tohka	I cannot tell if I am sad or relieved. Hm...	
Message	None	(Hahaha. That must've been rough for Tohka.)	
Message	None	"(Before we knew it, the sun was beginning to
set. I could hear a crow cawing from afar.)"	
Message	Shido	*sigh*... What a day.	
Message	Tohka	"I realized that playing with a dog is very
involving..."	
Message	None	"(Her realization was expressed with a pouty
face, only a little deflated from earlier.)"	
Message	Shido	But it was fun, wasn't it?	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! Really fun!	
Message	Shido	"Great. Do you want to play with dogs again
in the future?"	
Message	Tohka	"That is debatable. It depends on whether or
not the dog is obedient."	
Message	Shido	Sure, but you got it to do some cool tricks.	
Message	None	"(To command a dog you've met for the first
time to do a triple flip is out of this world.)"	
Message	Tohka	But I couldn't make it listen to me...	
Message	Shido	"Who cares? I mean, no one can do everything,
right? You did your best, right Tohka? That's
all that matters."	
Message	Tohka	Shido... Thank you.	
Message	Shido	"Nothing to thank me for. Tohka, do you want
to get dinner? Anything you want."	
Message	Tohka	Oh! Then what should I do...?	
Message	Shido	"You better hurry, or I'll pick a vegetarian
meal."	
Message	Tohka	"What?! Wait a minute, Shido! I'll come up
with something right now! Hm..."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. I'm kidding, but I'll wait until we're
close to the market."	
Message	Tohka	Okay, got it!	
Message	None	"(Delicious food always made Tohka smile.
I remembered her playing with the dog, and
I couldn't help giving a wry smile.)"
