Message	Tohka	"What's the matter? The screen with the ""geme
turned black!"""	
Message	Kotori	It shut down?! Hey Reine, what's going on here?!	
Message	Reine	Hm...	
Message	Reine	"I'm unsure of the cause, but it seems as though
the simulation is still running."	
Message	Kotori	"The simulation's still running, but we can't
monitor it from the outside? So, you're saying
we were the ones cut off?!"	
Message	Reine	It would appear so.	
Message	Kotori	"Well, this is an unexpected disaster.
What's happening to Shido?"	
Message	Reine	"I don't know, but his consciousness hasn't
returned yet."	
Message	Reine	"In other words, he's stuck in ""My Little Shido 2""."	
Message	Kotori	So we can't talk to him?	
Message	Reine	"Since the system is still running, I've been
trying to reach out to him in safe mode,
but there's been no reaction."	
Message	Kotori	"...Very well. It may come with its own obstacles,
but we'll need to force Shido to log out. I think
staying like this would be way more dangerous."	
Message	Reine	We can't.	
Message	Kotori	Why not?! We can't just leave him in there.	
Message	Reine	"I've been trying that already. No action on our
side is working."	
Message	Kotori	"Then how about force-quitting the simulator?
If the device itself is powered off..."	
Message	Reine	"That would be difficult, too. Any commands from
the outside seem to be completely non-functional."	
Message	Kotori	"What the hell?! So there's a bug in the
programming? No, but even if it were
that, it's still weird!"	
Message	Reine	"Yeah, the conditions seem odd for just an ordinary
bug. We're using the Realizer, so I can't think
of ways this could happen in the first place."	
Message	Kotori	"Do you think someone's intervening from
the outside? Is that possible?!"	
Message	Reine	"Yes. Given the presence of that mysterious NPC,
I'm sensing that someone has tampered with it."	
Message	Kotori	Are you suggesting the Fraxinus has been hacked?!	
Message	Reine	"Right... Though it would be immensely difficult to
do so... No, we can pretty much say it's
impossible."	
Message	Reine	"The Fraxinus's security can't be hacked, even with
all the power of DEM's digital brain department
combined."	
Message	Kotori	"Regardless, we need to figure out the cause
of this first in order to get Shido back."	
Message	Kotori	"If the commands to log out of the simulation
aren't working, then we'll have to physically
separate him from the device..."	
Message	Reine	No, that's too dangerous...	
Message	Reine	"If we force-quit, there's a strong possibility
that it'll injure his brain."	
Message	Kotori	What... Rgh...	
Message	Kotori	"God, Shido! Why do you always have to get
into trouble?!"	
Message	Tohka	"What's going on, Kotori? Reine? What happened to
Shido? He seems to be sleeping... Can we not wake
him?"	
Message	Yoshinon	We can't do that, Tohka-chan. Judging from what I\njust heard, if we force Shido-kun off, it seems\nlike it won't end well for him.	
Message	Reine	Exactly...	
Message	Yoshino	N-No... Shido-san...	
Message	Tohka	"Then, Shido is going to remain like this?! I-Is
there a possibility... that he'll never wake
up...?"	
Message	Yoshino	N-No... That can't be. I don't want that!	
Message	Kaguya	Shido... Yuzuru, Shido will be okay, right...?	
Message	Yuzuru	Anxious... Yuzuru feels the same way, Kaguya.	
Message	Miku	Darling...	
Message	Reine	"This isn't good. It's starting to drastically
affect the Spirits' states."	
Message	Kotori	"You're right... I mean it's all happening right
before their eyes. I don't blame them."	
Message	Kotori	"But if they rampage while Shido's like this, we
won't have any countermeasure. We need to figure
something out for Shido before things get bad."	
Message	Reine	"Kotori, you don't need to be so tough. You're
worried about your brother too, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"I-It's not like that! I'm saying this
as the Commander!"	
Message	Reine	"Just calm down, Kotori. I'm going to focus on
ascertaining the cause. You handle the Spirits."	
Message	Kotori	Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"If we force Shido awake, we don't know what'll
happen to his mental state. But for now,
he's fine."	
Message	Tohka	O-Oh, so long as he's safe.	
Message	Miku	Darling, I'm so worried～	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido... I can't believe he will linger in the
void of sleep..."	
Message	Reine	This...	
Message	Kotori	Did you figure something out, Reine?!	
Message	Reine	"I can't say I've figured it out just yet. But I
was able to verify something irregular
inside the Fraxinus's main computer."	
Message	Miku	So was it that cyber-attack thingy?	
Message	Reine	"No... As I said earlier, it's pretty much impossible
to hack into the Fraxinus's main computer."	
Message	Reine	For a human, that is.	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. What do you mean by that?	
Message	Yoshinon	So you're saying if you're not human,\nyou can do it? Is that it?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What do you mean by that, Yoshinon?	
Message	Kotori	"If it's not a human, isn't it obvious? It must be
the doing of an unidentified Spirit..."	
Message	Yoshino	"A S-Spirit...? Is there a very powerful Spirit-san
inside the... machine...?"	
Message	Miku	"Just like my Gabriel, there are Angels with special
abilities... So you're saying there are Spirits
with the ability to do something like this, right?"	
Message	Reine	"Yeah, your assumptions are correct. However, maybe
it's premature at this point to call it a Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	What do you mean?	
Message	Reine	"This Spirit-like existence doesn't exist in the
real world. It's as if the program itself contains
the power of a Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	"So this thing is only active via data?!
"	
Message	Kotori	Could it be—	
Message	Kotori	 No, wait a minute!	
Message	Reine	What's the matter, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Is it possible... that it could be an AI Spirit?	
Message	Reine	"Yes, I was thinking that could be a possibility. I
wouldn't be surprised if an organization like DEM
created it to use the Spirits' powers for evil."	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. So they accessed data that contained Spirit
powers... And it would make sense that they were
able to bypass the Fraxinus's security."	
Message	Reine	"The other alternative is that this was done by
someone who has access to the main computer...
but I don't think that's the case."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. Of course. Anyways, we're getting on the
right track now."	
Message	Kotori	"This means war. It's a date between that thing and
us..."	
Message	Reine	"Yes. If there has been interference from the
outside, the girl that Shin met earlier seems
the most suspicious."	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. She seemed a bit inhuman, so I'd hazard a
guess that she's our girl. Ugh... We totally
fell for it..."	
Message	Kotori	"Let's get her and put her in a cell where she can
never sweep our mines ever again."	
Message	Reine	...That sounds like a fun space.	
Message	Kotori	"Right? It'll be specially designed with a 90%
increase in land mines. Anyways..."	
Message	Reine	"Right. I'm sure we can do something with the
information we have. Let's look for ways we can
save Shin."	
Message	Kotori	I'll leave you to it.	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways, to be cracked like this now, of all
times... Can it be... their aim all along was
to strike precisely during testing...?"
