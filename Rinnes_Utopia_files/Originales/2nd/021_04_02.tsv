Message	Origami	Welcome home, Shido.	
Message	Shido	What are you doing at my house, Origami?	
Message	Origami	I was waiting for you to get home.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Kinda reminds me of earlier.	
Message	Origami	Shido, you like idols?	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! Uh well... I just thought it was nice
because it was something new."	
Message	Origami	"I see. So, I was so beautiful that you wanted to
marry me. If that's the case, we will need proof
of the union."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no! Why do you have selective hearing?!
And don't try to take your skirt off!"	
Message	Origami	Not a problem. I seem to have heard incorrectly.	
Message	None	"(J-Just... Ugh, I'm not even going to ask any
questions. I should change the subject as soon as
possible.)"	
Message	Shido	Come to think of it, is Maria not home yet?	
Message	Origami	"...I heard she's staying back at school. Are you
going to go pick her up?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh yeah, huh... I guess I should. It's pretty
dark out, and if she doesn't come home, I can't
get dinner ready."	
Message	Origami	I see. Then I'm going with you.	
Message	Shido	Wh-Why...?	
Message	Origami	"The school is on my way home. It makes sense that
I accompany you."	
Message	None	"(...Origami's house is on the way to school. But I
thought everyone was staying at the
Spirit Mansion...)"	
Message	Origami	Touch.	
Message	Shido	"Ah!
"	
Message	Shido	A-Anyways! Let's just go.	
Message	None	"(So we arrived at school, but... I can sense
Origami is always looking for a chance to do
something.)"	
Message	Origami	"An empty campus... We are alone... And right
there, there is..."	
Message	Shido	"M-Maybe Maria? I need to find her quickly and go
home!"	
Message	None	"(Please Maria, hurry up and come out. Or else I'll
be in trouble in more ways than one! I need to
find something to talk about to buy time.)"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, Origami? Can I ask you something? It's
about Maria."	
Message	Origami	Maria Arusu?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, do you think I'm able to teach what Maria
wants to learn?"	
Message	Origami	"You're too nice, Shido. That isn't the only thing
you can teach. I think there's a lot more you
can expand upon."	
Message	None	"(*Grunt*... Crap, this isn't the kind of subject I
should have brought up with Origami.)"	
Message	Origami	But I told you before. That I want to trust you.	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	"That's why I want you to do what you think is
right, Shido. And I want you to show it to me."	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Origami	"However I won't forgive you for cheating. Before
you do anything bad, it's priority to determine
established facts."	
Message	Shido	"So this is how it ends up, huh?!
...Hey, there's Maria!"	
Message	Origami	Tch...	
Message	Shido	So there you are, Maria. I was looking for you.	
Message	Maria	So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Maria	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Shido	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Maria	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart
skips a beat, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	Origami	"...Shido, if you found her, you should return home
immediately. And you should take me, your
girlfriend, home too."	
Message	Shido	"H-Heyyy! Origami, don't pull me. Maria, if you're
satisfied, let's go home."	
Message	Maria	Okay, Shido.	
Message	None	"(Maria came to my other side, and softly held my
hand. We were weirdly aligned, but we walked
home together.)"
