Message	None	"(I'm going to go check on Kotori. She never
usually cooks. I wonder what she's going to make.)"	
Message	Shido	Kotori, can I help you with anything? I'm bored...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, perfect timing. I want you to get down on
all fours."	
Message	Shido	Okay... Hey, wait! What do you mean by that?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm not asking you to give me a ride or kiss my
feet or anything. Just hurry up and do it."	
Message	Shido	Tell me the reason before I do it.	
Message	Kotori	"I can't reach the plate on the top shelf. Isn't it
obvious?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, I thought you were...	
Message	Kotori	"What? If you want to be a pet dog or something,
and depend on me for the rest of your life, I can
definitely hear you out."	
Message	Shido	"Of course not! Anyways, sure... But couldn't you
have used a chair?"	
Message	Kotori	"I was just thinking that, but you came at such a
perfect time. I took that to mean that you wanted
your little sister to use you as a step stool."	
Message	Shido	...I came at a horrible time.	
Message	Kotori	Just do it.	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay.	
Message	Kotori	You ready? I'm going to get on.	
Message	Shido	Sure.	
Message	Kotori	Here I go. Hmmm...	
Message	Shido	Did you find it?	
Message	Kotori	"How does it feel to be a horse? Being in service
to your little sister."	
Message	Shido	Forget that, just hurry up and get the plate!	
Message	Kotori	...There it is. Okay, I got it.	
Message	Shido	Cool.	
Message	Kotori	Thanks, you can go now.	
Message	Shido	Is there anything else you want me to do?	
Message	Kotori	"Don't worry about me. Just look forward to my
dish. Now go."	
Message	Shido	...I-I don't know about this.
