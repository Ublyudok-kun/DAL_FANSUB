Message	Shido	It's dark. Where am I...? Oh, Takadai...?	
Message	Shido	Huh? I wonder why I'm out here this time of night.	
Message	Shido	"And I sense something more unusual. I feel like
the scale of this view is really grand..."	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	None	"(Th-That was a close one. That ball-looking
thing... How big was that?)"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Something... feels off... Hm?	
Message	None	"(Seems like the vending machine over there's
turned off... Oh, I see a cat in the reflection.)"	
Message	Shido	"A small animal... It looks like a cat. But I've
never seen an animal like it..."	
Message	Shido	Oh. No, that's not it! I'm not in the reflection?!	
Message	None	(...Or could this little animal be me?)	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the hell?!	
Message	Kotori	Sorry. I know I'm late.	
Message	Kotori	"I was doing homework and I forgot about our
meeting time.
"	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori! My body! My body!	
Message	Kotori	"Body? What's wrong with you?
You have a stomachache?"	
Message	Shido	"NO! Look at me! Something crazy's happening! I
don't know how, but I've turned into some kind
of animal!"	
Message	Shido	"But... how did you know it was me, Kotori? Despite
my looks..."	
Message	Kotori	What are you blabbering about, Shido?	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, ever since you came to this world, you've
looked like that."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? This world? Have I always been like this? But
I'm Shido Itsuka..."	
Message	Kotori	"What's wrong with you, Shido? Don't tell me even
your brains have devolved into an animal's. Seems
you're a lost cause. Maybe I can dissect you."	
Message	Shido	"*Grunt*... The way she talks is definitely Kotori.
Then I'm really..."	
Message	Kotori	"*Sigh*. Listen to me, Shido. You came from the
Magic Kingdom to save Tengu City from danger,
right?"	
Message	Kotori	"You met me by fate, we signed a contract, and you
gave me these powers."	
Message	Kotori	You really don't remember all this?	
Message	Shido	Magic Kingdom? Tengu City in danger?	
Message	None	"(Now that you mention it, I'm starting
to remember.)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, that's right. I... came from the
Magic Kingdom...)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido! Did you hear that...?!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I did. They're here, aren't they? Let's go,
Kotori!"	
Message	Kotori	Okay!	
Message	None	"(That's right. I remember now. I came from another
planet to save Tengu City.)"	
Message	None	(I'm protecting them from... Gang Z!)	
Message	Kotori	Shido, look!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I see them. A few bad-looking apples.	
Message	None	"(When we ran in, we saw a few men dressed in all
black spandex causing a ruckus.)"	
Message	Combatant A	UIIIII!	
Message	Combatant B	UIII!	
Message	Combatant C	UIII!	
Message	Shido	I feel like I've heard this before.	
Message	Kotori	I knew it. It's Gang Z. Those pathetic losers!	
Message	Combatant C	Wahhhh. I hate people who look happy!	
Message	Shido	...U-Um. S-Stop right there, Gang Z!	
Message	Kotori	"If you keep up these wrongdoings, we won't let you
get away with it."	
Message	Combatant C	"What's up with you guys? It's time for you kids to
be in bed."	
Message	Shido	"Uh, there's not much of an age difference between
you two."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no, no. Once I start picking at one part, I
won't be able to focus. We need to stop them,
pronto."	
Message	Kotori	Shido, use your powers!	
Message	Shido	I know. Let's go, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Got it!	
Message	Kotori	Elemental Release, Contract On!	
Message	Shido	Transformation sequence approved!	
Message	Kotori	...TRANSFORM!	
Message	None	"(A bright light shone, and there stood Kotori,
fully dressed in battle gear.)"	
Message	Shido	"Kotori Itsuka, a typical student by day, uses
powers from the Spirits of another planet to turn
into Magical Girl Miracle★Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	What's the matter, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Well... What's up with all the exposition? And who
were you talking to?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, this is just typical stuff.	
Message	Shido	Isn't there something you need to say?	
Message	Kotori	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"You know what I'm talking about. Your magical girl
catchphrase. You know like a, "that means you"
type of thing."	
Message	Kotori	I-I have to say it, too?!	
Message	Shido	"I mean you might as well, right? I think it's
better if you go all out. Say something."	
Message	Kotori	But I don't know what to say... Uh... Uh....	
Message	Kotori	M-Magical Girl Miracle★Kotori to the rescue!	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's good. Keep it up.	
Message	Kotori	In the name of love and justice, I'm going to...	
Message	Kotori	B-Beat the crap out of you losers!	
Message	Shido	W-Wait a minute! Stop!	
Message	Shido	"Why are you all of a sudden saying you'll beat the
crap out of people? That's too barbaric."	
Message	Shido	"That's not something a heroine of justice would
say."	
Message	Kotori	"B-But I can't help it. You made me come up with
something on the fly. I couldn't come up with
anything cute!"	
Message	Shido	"But that doesn't mean you had to go the complete
opposite direction. I mean, don't you have a nice
bone in your body?"	
Message	Kotori	"Wh-What's your problem? I mean, it's your fault
for putting it on me like that. If I'd known ahead
of time, I woulda come up with something cute."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, yeah... I guess that's my fault too.
Sorry..."	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. Well it wasn't my fault... *sniffle*.	
Message	None	"(Crap. I guess I went too far. I didn't think
she'd be this bummed out. I'm Kotori's sidekick.
Why am I putting her down?)"	
Message	Combatant C	Um. Could you deal with us soon?	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. Give us a moment. It'll be over quick.	
Message	None	"(Are these bad guys going to politely wait like
this? They must not be very bad people.)"	
Message	Shido	...Y-Yeah. Okay, Kotori, let's try again.	
Message	Shido	"I know I sprung it on you. Now though, you think
you got it?"	
Message	Kotori	Huh? O-Oh... yeah.	
Message	Kotori	Of course. I'll do it right next time.	
Message	Shido	Make sure you make it super cute!	
Message	Kotori	*Whimper*... I know.	
Message	Kotori	Cute, cute... Okay!	
Message	Kotori	M-Magical Girl Miracle★Kotori to the rescue!	
Message	Kotori	In the name of love and justice, I'm going to...	
Message	Kotori	Punish you bad guys!	
Message	Shido	All right! Good job, Kotori!	
Message	None	"(It seemed a bit bland, but she did well
this time.)"	
Message	Combatant C	"Hmph. Come at us, Miracle★Kotori! Gang Z is going
to win this brawl!"	
Message	Combatant A	Uiii!	
Message	Combatant B	Ui-Uiii!	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. I wonder how long you dogs can keep barking.
Let's do this, Gang Z! Crawl on your knees and beg
for forgiveness!"	
Message	Kotori	Hi-yah!	
Message	Combatant A	Uiii! (Ouch!)	
Message	Kotori	Yah!	
Message	Combatant B	U-Ui! (A-Ah!)	
Message	Kotori	Heeee-yah!	
Message	Combatant C	Ack!	
Message	Combatant C	*Grunt* You're strong, Miracle★Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	I'm not done yet!	
Message	Kotori	Hi-yah!	
Message	Combatant C	*Cough*	
Message	Combatant C	Ouch.	
Message	Combatant C	H-Hey, wait, stop!	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Combatant C	Ugh! Ouch! *cough*...!	
Message	None	"(It all seems one-sided. I think I should stop her
now.)"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, Kotori? I think it's too violent now.
You're a magical girl so you should be more kind."	
Message	Kotori	"No. If you forgive them mid-way, they'll just go
back to doing bad things again."	
Message	Kotori	"So I need to teach them to never do such bad
things ever again! "	
Message	Combatant C	AHHH! P-Please stop!	
Message	Shido	"...I'm starting to feel bad for them. It doesn't
seems like they're alone in the wrongdoings
at this point."	
Message	None	(What do I do? Do I stop them?)	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What's that?	
Message	Combatant C	"Hehehe. Oof! You think you're all that—ouch! You
watch. Miracle★Kotori—AH!"	
Message	Combatant C	With this newly developed weapon!	
Message	Shido	What? He has a plan?	
Choice		Warn Kotori.	
Choice		No, I'll just watch out for her.	
Message	Shido	"Watch out, Kotori. Looks like he still has
something up his sleeve!"	
Message	Kotori	Yah! Yah! Huh...? He does?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... Calm down and watch your opponent!	
Message	Kotori	The opponent, huh...? *stare*...	
Message	Combatant C	"You can pretend you're all that for now. But as
long as I have this new weapon. Muahahahaha..."	
Message	Kotori	What about it?	
Message	Combatant C	"Don't be surprised. This elemental confuser is
going to interfere with the magic girl's powers!"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Combatant C	"And it's going to sap the power that it takes to
maintain that outfit of yours... huh?"	
Message	Kotori	"Go on. Continue. And what happens when it saps the
power to maintain this outfit of mine?"	
Message	Combatant C	"Oh... Well, um... It'll get in it's... way...
Or maybe not?"	
Message	Kotori	Divine Punishment!	
Message	Combatant C	I'm sorry!	
Message	Combatant A・B	Uiiii! (Just wait and see!)	
Message	Kotori	*Sigh*... And the evil's gone.	
Message	Shido	"Right. A lot of questionable stuff happened in the
middle, but all's well that ends well."	
Message	Kotori	Then let's go home... It's kind of smoky out here.	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, you're right... Wait, isn't
that the new weapon he dropped?"	
Message	Kotori	Wait, don't tell me... AHHHHH!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter, Kotori?! What happened?!	
Message	Kotori	"Y-You can't look. Promise me you're not going
to look this way! If you do, I'll kill you!"	
Message	Shido	What do you mean? O-Ohhhh, your clothes.	
Message	Kotori	I told you to not look!	
Message	Shido	J-Just, let's hurry home. Retreat!	
Message	Kotori	Ugh, why is this happening?!	
Message	None	(In the very end, it did not all end well.)	
Message	Shido	"He may have something up his sleeve. I guess I'll
have to keep a close watch."	
Message	Kotori	"Hah! Yah! How's this? You gonna repent now,
buddy? *pant, pant*..."	
Message	Shido	...Seems like it. Look at him.	
Message	None	"(Maybe she's stressed. I'll take her out to a nice
meal sometime soon.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's not like I can make her food like this.
Hahaha."	
Message	Shido	"Wait, why am I all relaxed? Where's the other guy?
C-Crap, I lost sight of him."	
Message	Combatant C	Hehehehe. I'm ready now.	
Message	Shido	Oh. There he is.	
Message	Combatant C	"Now, eat this! My new weapon! The Elemental
Confuser!"	
Message	Shido	"The Elemental Confuser?! I wonder what that is...
It seems like gas is coming out of that cylinder."	
Message	Shido	"This clearly doesn't look good. Is this gas going
to intervene with the magical girl's powers?"	
Message	Shido	Watch out, Kotori! He's going to pull something!	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine... *cough, cough*... Nothing's wrong
with me yet."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Maybe it was defective?	
Message	Shido	Wait, Kotori. Your clothes!	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Clothes? What about th—AHHHHH!	
Message	Kotori	What is going on?! Oh my gosh!	
Message	Kotori	"Is it because of the gas? My clothes are
starting to..."	
Message	Kotori	"N-No... It can't be! At this rate, all of my
clothes will—!"	
Message	Shido	C-Calm down, Kotori. Don't panic.	
Message	Kotori	"...Sh-Sh-Sh-Shido! What are you looking at?!
D-Don't look this way!"	
Message	Shido	O-Ohhh, sorry! But I have to do something!	
Message	Shido	Kotori. Can you fight?	
Message	Kotori	N-Nooo!	
Message	Shido	I-I thought so! Then what should I do?	
Message	Combatant C	"Hehehehhe. So what now, Miracle★Kotori? This gas
intervenes with your Spirit powers... and it won't
maintain the appearance of your clothes."	
Message	Shido	"How could you develop such an awesome yet
inappropriate thing?!"	
Message	Combatant C	"It's hard to see with the gas. I'm going over
there, so hang on! AHAHAHAHA!"	
Message	Kotori	It... It...	
Message	Kotori	It's YOUR FAULT!	
Message	Combatant C	NWAAAAA!	
Message	Combatant A・B	UIIIII!	
Message	Shido	O-Oh! You did it, Kotori! Nice punch! Good one!	
Message	Kotori	Sh... Sh...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	Don't look either, Shido!	
Message	Shido	OWWW!	
Message	Kotori	Phew. That was a close one.	
Message	Shido	"A lot happened, but I'm glad we were able to
defeat Gang Z. Thanks to you, we were able to
maintain peace in the town."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah... But I paid for it.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'm sure they'll continue to come after the
town. Kotori, will you continue your contract
with me and fight on?"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Kotori	"Well... I guess. If you're going to ask that way,
how can I say no? I suppose I'll hang in there a
bit longer. You'd better be grateful."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	Hehe... likewise.	
Message	None	"(And our battle continues until Gang Z has been
defeated once and for all. Fight on, Magical Girl
Miracle★Kotori!)"
