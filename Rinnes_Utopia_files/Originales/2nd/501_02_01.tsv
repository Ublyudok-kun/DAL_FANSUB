Message	None	(Now...)	
Message	None	"(I bought all the things I needed, so all that's
left is...)"	
Message	None	(The tea set Kotori asked me to buy.)	
Message	Kotori	"Listen to me, Shido. Your adorable little sister
is going to use this tea set. If you screw this
up, I will rip it off and use it as a saucer."	
Message	None	"(...That's what she told me. I don't know what
she's going to rip off, but I can't mess this up.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if there are any good stores around...
Wait a minute... that's...)"	
Message	None	"(An antique store... I didn't know that
was there.)"	
Message	None	(...Iyotokado, huh? What an odd name.)	
Message	None	"(But the shop window seems to have some dinnerware
on display. Maybe I'll find some tea sets inside.)"	
Message	None	"(The shop seems high-end, so I'm kind of
intimidated... All right, here goes nothing.)"	
Message	Shido	Excuse me...	
Message	None	(This shop is really something.)	
Message	None	"(It's bigger than I expected. There are tons of
things here...)"	
Message	None	"(At the center of the store was a doll. Really
pretty, and life-sized. Wow, I wonder how
much it is...)"	
Message	Tohka	Welcome. Can I help you with anything?	
Message	Shido	Whoa.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... sorry. Are you the staff here? You were so
beautiful that I thought you were a doll."	
Message	Tohka	"My, you're very kind. I'm the owner of this shop.
My name is Tohka."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, so you're the owner. I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	Tohka, that sounds familiar...	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's right. "Iyo Tohka do."	
Message	Tohka	"Yes. I'm embarrassed to admit that my name is in
the shop's name."	
Message	Shido	"I see. No wonder why it sounded so familiar. Makes
sense."	
Message	Shido	But then, what does the "Iyo" part mean?	
Message	Tohka	My grandfather passed away a few years ago.	
Message	Shido	Huh? O-Oh okay... I see... So it's his name, huh?	
Message	Tohka	"My grandfather started this place, and named it a
combination of his and my name, but I am currently
the sole owner."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. I'm sorry for asking such a sensitive
question... I wish I could have met Iyo-san."	
Message	Tohka	It's actually pronounced "Iyo."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I'm sorry!	
Message	Tohka	"It's fine. I may not be worthy, but I would love
to show you around."	
Message	Shido	"What? Don't say that. You're handling this place
on your own, right? Despite looking like you're
my age."	
Message	Tohka	No, I'm not good at all yet...	
Message	Shido	"Honestly, I've never met anyone as elegant as you.
It's hard to explain, but you seem to embody the
spirit of the shop. I think that's amazing."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, um... You're making me blush.	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Tohka	Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	No, it's... Tohka-san, you're so gorgeous.	
Message	Tohka	...Thank you.	
Message	Tohka	So what kind of item are you looking for today?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh, yeah. I'm looking for an item for my
little sister...."	
Message	Tohka	"If she's your little sister, she must be quite
adorable. I am certain that I can find an
appropriate item for you."	
Message	None	(Oh wow, she returned the compliment...)	
Message	Tohka	"Besides, this store has a variety of items. I'm
sure I can provide something in your budget."	
Message	Shido	Th-Then... I guess I'll look around.	
Message	Tohka	Wonderful. What kind of item are you looking for?	
Choice		A tea set.	
Choice		A traditional Japanese tea set.	
Choice		A pet food bowl.	
Message	Shido	I'm looking for a tea set.	
Message	Tohka	"Well then, I know the perfect one. Please have a
look at this."	
Message	Shido	"Whoa... This is a fine piece... but this is a golf
tee."	
Message	Tohka	It's a 12-piece set.	
Message	Shido	"No. My little sister doesn't play golf. I think.
That's not it, I'm looking for the kind of tea set
that an antique shop carries."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, my apologies. I have mistaken the type of
"tee" you were looking for."	
Message	Shido	Well yeah, but this is an antique shop, isn't it?	
Message	Tohka	Well then, please have a look to your right.	
Message	Shido	"Right side...? Oh... I see something,
but what is it?"	
Message	Shido	"It's a huge letter "T"... And there's a chain, a
whip, and a candle... And what's this?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? A toothpick, a cross, teriyaki jerky...
What?! A table runner, and even a toy duck..."	
Message	Tohka	It's a T-set.	
Message	Shido	"Uh, what can you use this set for?!
It makes no sense!"	
Message	Tohka	My apologies.	
Message	Shido	"Um... Like I told you, I'm looking for a tea set.
You know, what you would use to pour tea and drink
with..."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, that's what you meant.	
Message	Shido	"Usually people don't mistake it for anything
else... And what is the T-set anyways?
I've never heard of it..."	
Message	Tohka	It's Tohka's special set.	
Message	Shido	"Didn't see that one coming! What reason would you
have to put them all together for?!"	
Message	Tohka	"If it's something you pour tea with,
it will be here."	
Message	Shido	"So you're going to ignore my question?! Well, it's
fine, I guess..."	
Message	Tohka	So this here is foreign porcelain...	
Message	Shido	Wow! Wait, is this Meissen china?	
Message	Tohka	Mei...? Uh... what did you just say...?	
Message	Shido	Meissen. That famous kind of porcelain?	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yeah... I think it's that Meissen...	
Message	Shido	"You think... Why do you not sound very confident
about it...? Uh, this is an antique, isn't it?"	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, of course it is. Isn't it that famous Meissen
porcelain?"	
Message	Shido	"Why are you answering with a question?! I'm asking
you."	
Message	Tohka	Sir, please do not worry. This is an an-tick shop.	
Message	Shido	You mean... antique, right?	
Message	Tohka	"Since this is an an-tick shop, every item is
priced at museum-worthy levels."	
Message	Shido	"You said it again, but you still didn't
say it right!"	
Message	Tohka	My apologies.	
Message	None	"(This is weird. At first, the shop had this air of
elegance and fantasy. Now it feels like a very
ordinary place.)"	
Message	Tohka	So about the pork cutlet sandwich you wanted...	
Message	Shido	"I didn't ask for that! How does a tea set become a
pork cutlet sandwich..."	
Message	Tohka	*Nom, nom*...	
Message	Shido	She's eating one...!	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! I was getting a bit hungry...	
Message	Shido	Ngh... She's a total glutton...	
Message	Tohka	"Ahem. Anyways. You were looking for a tea set,
were you not?"	
Message	Shido	Yes... I am. I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind.	
Message	Tohka	But why?	
Message	Shido	"I mean, that tea set still has the pricing sticker
from the discount store."	
Message	Tohka	How strange...	
Message	Shido	"Not strange. Not strange... This shop is basically
a discount store. If I bought this, God knows what
Kotori would say to me..."	
Message	Tohka	G-Grrrr...	
Message	Shido	"That said... I'm sorry, but I won't be buying
anything for today."	
Message	Tohka	W-Wait, customer!	
Message	Shido	"Th-The way you're talking...! What happened to the
elegant way you spoke earlier?!"	
Message	Tohka	"Why, you... You think this store is no big deal,
so you're making fun of it, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No... Well, I don't know much about this
place... but I can't help but feel that the
owner is..."	
Message	Tohka	"In that case, allow me to show you the finest tea
set we offer."	
Message	Shido	"What?! Y-You have such a thing? Your tone changed
back to elegant..."	
Message	Tohka	*Giggle* Don't be surprised when you see it, okay?	
Message	None	"(Uh, what do I do... I have no plans on buying a
real antique...)"	
Message	None	"(Well if we've come this far, I guess I am curious
as to whether this is a true antique shop...)"	
Message	Tohka	"I believe it's under this shelf... Just a
moment... *grunt*..."	
Message	Shido	Hey, that's dangerous...	
Message	Tohka	Ah?! O-Oh, no!	
Message	Shido	AHHHHHH!	
Message	None	"(While the owner hung her head low, I rushed out
of the shop. I'm never coming here again.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'm thinking tea time with a traditional Japanese
tea set would be cool."	
Message	Tohka	A traditional Japanese tea set, huh...	
Message	Shido	Yes. D-Do you not have one...?	
Message	Tohka	"No, I happen to have some here in the back. Please
have a look."	
Message	Shido	"Whoa, you do?! I see... The back corner seems to
have a very Japanese style to it."	
Message	Tohka	Please feel free to look around.	
Message	Shido	D-Don't mind if I do...	
Message	None	(There are a lot of things here. Let's see...)	
Message	Shido	"W-Wow, this is one nice tea set. What's the tray
made of?"	
Message	Tohka	That is... wood.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Yes, I understand it's wood. I meant to ask
what kind of wood."	
Message	Tohka	J-Japanese wood, I would say.	
Message	Shido	Well... I'd assume it's from a Japanese tree!	
Message	None	"(Huh... Just earlier, this place felt so
fantastical and elegant, but suddenly
I'm getting this vibe of uselessness...)"	
Message	Shido	"I want to know the specifics, like whether it's
Japanese cedar, Paulownia, or Hinoki cypress...
Wouldn't you know as the shop owner?"	
Message	Tohka	It's a Japanese tree.	
Message	Shido	No, that doesn't really change anything.	
Message	Tohka	I'm sorry. It is a very old item...	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... I do see that it's old. O-Oh well.	
Message	Tohka	My apologies.	
Message	Shido	"So, do you know what the teapot is made of? It
kind of looks like a fusion between the east
and the west."	
Message	Tohka	Yes. It's made of metal.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I know that part. I mean, is it pure silver,
or just silver-plated..."	
Message	Tohka	Of course, it is made with metals from this earth.	
Message	Shido	"I-I knew that... I figured it was made on this
earth as well."	
Message	Tohka	It's Earth metal.	
Message	Shido	You don't have to specify that.	
Message	Tohka	It is the herald of Gaia.	
Message	Shido	"That sounds a bit cooler, but that's not what we
need here. You understand, right?"	
Message	Tohka	My apologies.	
Message	Shido	"Something feels suspicious... I'm starting to feel
like this shop is only for show. Well, anyways...
What about this teacup?"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh that is in the Arita style.
It uses eco-porcelain."	
Message	Shido	Oh?	
Message	Tohka	"The dye is made with a traditional style called
Mr. Nabeshima-style, a certain firing technique...
The color produced is vibrant, yet calming."	
Message	Shido	Now you're too knowledgeable!	
Message	Tohka	My apologies.	
Message	Shido	"...You were reading out of a catalogue! You had me
for a second!"	
Message	Tohka	Don't mind me.	
Message	Shido	Of course I do!	
Message	Tohka	"So what do you say, sir? Was there anything you
liked?"	
Message	Shido	Hmm... At this rate, I don't think I can decide...	
Message	Tohka	Take your time...	
Message	Shido	"I can't do that. I need to go home
and make dinner."	
Message	Tohka	...Dinner?!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	...Nothing.	
Message	Shido	Were you reacting to the dinner part?	
Message	Tohka	Of course that is not the case.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Shido	...I'm making Hamburg steak tonight.	
Message	Tohka	What?! Hamburg steak?!	
Message	Shido	So you were reacting to dinner.	
Message	Tohka	Th-That is not the case.	
Message	Shido	This is really trippy.	
Message	Tohka	...Hm?	
Message	None	"(Hm... I wonder why, but the more I talk to her,
the more her image from before crumbles...)"	
Message	None	"(I don't want her to make me buy anything weird. I
shouldn't rush to make a purchase...)"	
Message	Shido	Anyways... I'll have to go for today.	
Message	Tohka	"What? I-I see... I mean, er, is that so? Please do
not say such things, and take another look
around..."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, I'm done for the day.
Sorry to take your time."	
Message	Tohka	Oh?! P-Please wait! Sir... I mean, Hamburg!	
Message	Shido	"Who are you calling Hamburg?! Hey... something
looks like it's about to fall."	
Message	Tohka	Huh? AHHHHH!	
Message	None	"(In the end, I didn't buy anything, but I guess it
couldn't be helped. I'll tell Kotori I couldn't
find anything good enough.)"	
Message	None	"(That store seemed to be a hazard. I mean,
for a split second, it was really elegant, but...
I guess I can visit another time... or maybe not.)"	
Message	Shido	I'll go home now...	
Message	Shido	You see, I'm looking for a pet food bowl.	
Message	Tohka	"A pet bowl? I thought you were searching for
something for your little sister."	
Message	Shido	Well I was, but I thought it'd be funny.	
Message	Tohka	"Then what do you think about this item? It's a
vintage stainless steel feeder."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's pretty cool. I'll take it.	
Message	Tohka	Thank you for your purchase.	
Message	None	I wonder how Kotori will react.	
Message	Kotori	So... What is the meaning of this, Shido?	
Message	Shido	W-Well...	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, you can't even do the one thing I ask you to
do..."	
Message	Shido	"No, you see, it's....! Let me explain. I wanted
you to enjoy it, so I thought and thought..."	
Message	Kotori	"And you thought about buying me a doggy bowl?
Are you trying to start a fight with me? How very
bold..."	
Message	Shido	*Whimper*...	
Message	Kotori	"I suppose for tonight, this can be
your dinner plate."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"*Whimper*... I shouldn't buy anything on impulse
again."
