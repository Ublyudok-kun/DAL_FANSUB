Message	Origami	"I was a student at the infirmary where you came
in, Shido."	
Message	Kotori	"I think that's a pretty normal setting to be in.
It's not that unusual."	
Message	Origami	I see. So I was a normal girl.	
Message	Kotori	"So you know that you're usually not a normal
girl... Was that the only thing that was different
for you?"	
Message	Origami	...He saw my underwear. I was embarrassed.	
Message	Kotori	"...I see. Your being embarrassed over something
is a drastic change on its own. And what exactly
were you doing, Shido...?"	
Message	Shido	No, no, no! It was an accident! It was!
