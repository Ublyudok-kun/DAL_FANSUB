Message	Shido	Man it's pretty late.	
Message	Shido	"I didn't expect to get caught up in a study
session... I sure had some bad luck today."	
Message	Shido	"I feel more tired than usual. But knowing that
she'll be waiting for me at home..."	
Message	Shido	Hehe, I feel a little bit better.	
Message	Shido	I'm home.	
Message	Shido	"...Huh? Is she not home yet? Normally she'd be
here before me."	
Message	Kotori	Hi. Welcome home!	
Message	Shido	I'm home, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Grr...	
Message	Shido	Huh...? I'm home, Kotori-san?	
Message	Kotori	...No. Try again.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wh-What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	The usual...	
Message	Kotori	"You need to call me by the usual, or I won't
accept it."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... Okay, fine.	
Message	Shido	I-I'm home, Honey.	
Message	Kotori	Welcome home, darling ♪	
Message	None	(*Grunt*... I don't think I can do it.)	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, I can't do it. Let's call each other by
our normal names."	
Message	Kotori	Aww. Gosh. You're so whiny, Shido. Fine...	
Message	Kotori	Welcome home, Shido. My husband... Tee-hee♪	
Message	Shido	I'm home, Kotori.	
Message	None	"(It's been a month since Kotori and I got married.
We're still newlyweds, but it seems like our
married life is going well.)"	
Message	Shido	"Kotori attends school while also being a
housewife. She somehow makes it work
so well..."	
Message	Kotori	"What are you mumbling about, Shido? Why don't you
start by taking your shoes off? Here, I'll take
your bag."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"Of course, I'm your partner. Oh... I know!
Hey, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	"You want to eat first?
You want to take a bath first?
Or..."	
Message	Shido	"What?! Wh-What are you saying, Kotori?! Are you
crazy?"	
Message	Kotori	Huh...? Oh, you want me?	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kotori	"Just kidding. I'm still working on your bath and
I'm in the middle of making dinner. So hang on
a bit longer."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, would it have been better if it weren't a
joke?"	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no! It's fine! Just go back to the
kitchen. I'll go change and wait."	
Message	Kotori	"Okaaay. I put a change of clothes on the bed
for you."	
Message	Shido	"Got it. Jeez, she's starting to say all these
mature things."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	"I wonder what she would have said if I had said...
I wanted her?"	
Message	Shido	WHOA! What am I thinking of?!	
Message	Shido	"Okay, I've changed, but I wonder what Kotori's
making."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, sorry. It's going to be a bit longer, so why
don't you wait and watch TV?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Shido	Hm... I don't know how to put it...	
Message	Kotori	Huh...? What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	No, I guess I'm getting emotional.	
Message	Kotori	About what?	
Message	Shido	"It's nice to see your wife making dinner for you
in the kitchen."	
Message	Kotori	"Y-You idiot. What are you talking about, get out
of my way! I'm getting plates."	
Message	Shido	"Why can't I watch you, Kotori? You're my wife,
after all."	
Message	Kotori	"Aww, gosh! Do what you want, then! You're so
weird, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. Are you mad, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	No. I'm just blushing...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm just saying I'm about to go crazy because it
makes me happy that you're watching me. Anyways...
I'm going to do even better with cooking now."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...!	
Message	None	"(Ever since we got married, Kotori's aura has
changed... Or I guess she's more honest about her
feelings. She emanates an aura of love for me.)"	
Message	Shido	"Damn it. It's been a while since I've been hit by
such a strong blow. It's powerful..."	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh, it's your fault you're saying all these
things. Anyways, if you're going to just stand
there, why don't you taste-test?"	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	Kotori	Here you go.	
Message	Shido	Oh, today is beef stew? Hm...	
Message	Shido	"Ah... delicious! You've gotten even better,
Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	Really?!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. What's the point in lying? The flavoring's
just how I like it."	
Message	Shido	"I feel like your cooking's gotten better than
mine."	
Message	Kotori	Y-You think so? Tee-hee.	
Message	Shido	"You can cook, do laundry, everything. Man, you're
the ideal bride."	
Message	None	"(But... I guess it'd be an issue if the neighbors
found out we were married. It helps that we've
always been living under the same roof...)"	
Message	Shido	"...Is it okay if you're my only wife for a little
while?"	
Message	Kotori	"What are you talking about, Shido? You're starting
to grin."	
Message	Shido	Oops, was it that obvious?	
Message	Shido	I-It's nothing, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Hmm. I see. Is that soooo...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it? I was only thinking about you.	
Message	Kotori	"About me? Oh... I know. You were thinking of
something perverted, weren't you? We're not
doing that yet."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no, no! I wasn't thinking about that
at all..."	
Message	Kotori	Oh, is that so, Shido...?	
Message	None	"(I-It's coming. She's going to say something like,
"You're gross!" or "You insect!" or something to
turn my heart upside down!)"	
Message	Kotori	"W-We're going to save all that until we're both
adults."	
Message	Shido	AH!	
Message	Kotori	"Hehe. Ahh, look at you. Anyways, dinner's almost
ready, so hold on a little longer, okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, what a mischievous little sister... Well,
she's my wife now, huh? Man, she sure is a
mischievous young wife."	
Message	None	(...Calling her a young wife sounds bad.)	
Message	None	"(But anyways, this is so nice. Just seeing Kotori
cooking for me makes me feel warm on the inside.)"	
Message	Shido	Is this what you call happiness?	
Message	Shido	...What am I talking about?	
Message	Kotori	Hm-hmmmm ♪	
Message	Shido	But man...	
Message	Shido	"That you're not such a troublemaker anymore makes
me feel a bit lonely. I feel kind of lost..."	
Message	Shido	Kotori! How much longer?	
Message	Kotori	...♪	
Message	Shido	Kotori-saaaan?	
Message	Kotori	...♪	
Message	Shido	Hmm, she seems to be focused on cooking.	
Message	None	(I know!)	
Choice		I'll help Kotori.	
Choice		I'll play a trick on her.	
Message	None	"All right. I feel bad just watching,
so I'll help her."	
Message	Shido	Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	Huh? What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	I'll help, too. Can I do anything?	
Message	Kotori	Really? But I'm mostly done with the cooking part.	
Message	Kotori	Can you help me set the table?	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	Shido	Kotori, how many plates do you want?	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm... Two bowls. Oh, and one big plate, three
small plates... I think that's enough."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's a lot... Oh yeah, we have stew. Makes
sense. I'm going to pass behind you, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Owwww.	
Message	Kotori	S-Sorry, I bumped into you.	
Message	Shido	"No, me too... This place is too narrow for two
people to walk around, huh?"	
Message	Kotori	I'll come around the side, then.	
Message	Shido	Got it. Then I'm passing by... Ouch!	
Message	Shido	Ow!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-Why are you passing on the same side!	
Message	Shido	Well, I need to go this way to get the plates.	
Message	Kotori	Huh... Oh yeah, huh.	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, let me get through here... Now we're
good, Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	Sorry, Shido.	
Message	None	"(Crap, this isn't good. Clearly this is symbolic
of reality. We've become a married couple,
but we're not able to understand each other yet.)"	
Message	Shido	...This is an obstacle to overcome.	
Message	None	"(All right. When I come back the other way, I will
match Kotori's moves. Read Kotori's moves... I
should be able to do that if I'm her husband!)"

Message	Shido	...Ouch. I was able to protect the plate.	
Message	Shido	Kotori. Are you okay? Huh... Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	...Kyuuu.	
Message	Shido	Kotori!	
Message	Shido	I'm so sorry.	
Message	Shido	I wanted to help, but I just got in the way...	
Message	Shido	"And I almost got you hurt. And the meal got
burned... *sigh*..."	
Message	Kotori	Okay, stop right there!	
Message	Shido	Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. I'm not worried about it. I know you
weren't trying to get in the way, so I'm not mad."

happy. So it's all good. That's all I need."

my heart just jumped. This is so damaging...
seriously.)"

Message	Shido	Got it!	
Message	None	"(I know. I'll play a trick on her. I mean, a wife
in an apron obviously means I'd play around
with her. I'm sure Kotori wants it too!)"	
Message	None	"(...I know that's dumb reasoning, but I'm still
going to go through with it. My soul is lit with
an inextinguishable flame!)"

for it."

Message	Shido	...I'll start by touching her.	
Message	Kotori	AH! Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing?!	
Message	Shido	Well, there was a piece of string on your back.	
Message	Kotori	Oh really? Th-Thank you. But be careful, okay?	
Message	None	"(Hehehe. She fell for it. There was no string! I'm
still continuing, Kotori!)"	
Message	Shido	...Yah!	
Message	Kotori	KYAH!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What now?!	
Message	Shido	Oh, I thought I saw an insect.	
Message	Kotori	An insect?! D-Did you get it?	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, not yet. Don't move, okay Kotori?
I'll get it now."	
Message	Kotori	O-Okay. Hurry up.	
Message	Shido	Yah.

aren't you?"

that attractive in an apron?"

crazy."

world, and my wife... Only mine."

Message	Shido	Hm... Something...	
Message	Kotori	Something smells like it's burning...	
Message	Kotori	Ah! The meat!	
Message	Shido	T-Turn down the burner.	
Message	Kotori	B-But get away from me first!	
Message	None	"(In the end, the dish got a little burned. Kotori
was mad at first, but forgave me eventually.)"	
Message	Shido	"It was supposed to be a normal meal, but it ended
up being a big deal."	
Message	None	"(After all that happened, the dinner table was
finally full of the dishes she prepared.)"	
Message	Shido	"Mmm. It looks really delicious.
I'm digging right in!"	
Message	Kotori	Go on ahead. So... how is it?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's super good. I have no issues with any
of it, it's perfect."	
Message	Kotori	Y-Yeah? I'm so glad.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, but the meat is a bit charred.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry about that...

I'm going to eat it all.)"

Message	Kotori	But...	
Message	Shido	"Mm. It's not that bad. It's still really
delicious."

Message	Kotori	Oh, I know...!	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kotori	"H-Here. I'll feed you, so you'd better be
thankful."

waiting for me! I must respond, or I can't call
myself a man.)"	
Message	Shido	A-Ah... *nom*...	
Message	Kotori	How is it? Good?	
Message	None	"(The situation got me blushing, and Kotori's
peering at me so closely, I can barely taste
the food. But I know...)"

me makes it that much more delicious."
