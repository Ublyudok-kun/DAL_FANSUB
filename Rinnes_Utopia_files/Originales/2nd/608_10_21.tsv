Message	Maria	"I have observed many types of love. A multitude
of its forms."

Kotori's love. Origami's love. Kaguya and Yuzuru's

Message	Maria	"Love... What is it? I believe I have collected
enough data to know."	
Message	Maria	"Analyzing collected data...
My conclusion is..."	
Message	Maria	"――Analysis failed.
Running once more――failure..."	
Message	Maria	"I am still unable to decipher love. Why is this
the case? I should have collected more than
enough data by now..."	
Message	Maria	"What is love...? I should have already learned
this from the many dates Shido and the girls
had conducted."	
Message	Maria	"The love that Shido weaves, the dates with the
other girls. It is strange. When I think of Shido
Itsuka, I hear an electronic noise..."	
Message	Maria	"...! Could this be what they call intuition?
That's right. I have not performed the task
myself. I've yet to experience an *actual* date."	
Message	Maria	"I predict it may be necessary in order for me
to truly understand what love is. Beyond
that, my understanding is rudimentary."	
Message	Maria	"The peculiar noise I occasionally hear. If its
identity is love, then I am sure to learn."	
Message	Maria	"Let us begin. One more time. This time...
On a date between myself and Shido.
All to discover the meaning of love."
