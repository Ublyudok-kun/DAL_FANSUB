Message	Tonomachi	Later, Itsuka. Don't get too crazy tonight.	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about? Go home already!
Later, Tonomachi."	
Message	Tonomachi	Yeah. Later.	
Message	Shido	Jeez, that Tonomachi...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Do you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi. Wait... Where's your uniform?	
Message	Kurumi	I changed. I need to head out right away.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... It must be important if you're changing
for the occasion."	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. It's very important.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ah, Tokisaki-san! You look just as radiant in your
casual wear as you do in your uniform..."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tonomachi! I thought you went home?	
Message	Tonomachi	"I saw Tokisaki-san, so I had to come back. How
often do I get to see her in her normal clothes?
If I missed out, I'd regret it forever."	
Message	Shido	You're such an idiot.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Whatever! Why do you get to see her in her normal
clothes, but I can't?"	
Message	Kurumi	...You.	
Message	Tonomachi	Yes, what is it, Tokisaki-san?	
Message	Kurumi	Weren't you... Tonosama-san?	
Message	Tonomachi	Uh... no. Um. I'm Tonomachi...	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm sorry, but would you mind going away? I'm
speaking with Shido-san at the moment."	
Message	Tonomachi	"What... Tokisaki-san... You're so cold. Can't I
hang out for just a minute?"	
Message	Kurumi	"I think that minute is up. You'd best hurry or...
hehe. We're going to see red flowers bloom in the
streets."	
Message	Tonomachi	A-Ahhhh! G-Good-bye!	
Message	Shido	You're the usual level of harsh today.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, you think so? I was just being honest
with him."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. Well I won't ask too many questions.	
Message	Kurumi	Right... Then let's go, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, okay...	
Message	Shido	"Um, Kurumi, I thought you were going somewhere.
I mean, you even got dressed up."	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Like I said, we're on our way. To your house,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	...What?	
Message	Kurumi	I'm going to spend time with you at your house.	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh? Is that not allowed?	
Message	Shido	Well... you can, but...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Then it'll be as usual...	
Message	None	"(I thought she was going downtown because she got
all dressed up, but...)"	
Message	None	(I see. She's coming over to my place...)	
Message	Shido	I'm home...	
Message	Kurumi	I'm coming in.	
Message	Shido	"Okay... So we're here, but... what did you mean by
"as usual"?"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-saaaaaan～	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	Awww. I was so sad that you didn't hold me today.	
Message	Shido	"B-But that's no reason to just tackle me! And
this... Is this what's "as usual"?!"	
Message	Kurumi	I-It's because you won't hold me at school.	
Message	Shido	"Well, obviously people at school couldn't see
this... I mean, God knows what they'd say..."	
Message	Kurumi	And that's why I try to be a good girl at school.	
Message	Shido	"Good girl...? You're not just good, you're super
cool. You're ice cold. Especially towards
Tonomachi."	
Message	Kurumi	"At school I don't get enough of Shido-san, so I
get irritated. Please hurry, Shido-san... or else,
I'll be sad. I think I'm going to cry."	
Message	Shido	"Who would imagine... the cool and distant Kurumi
from school is actually this affectionate... No
one in class would ever believe it."	
Message	Kurumi	Hmm, mmmm... Shido-saaaan. Please hold me more.	
Message	Shido	"Um... Why don't we actually separate for now... I
mean, it's so hard to move."	
Message	Kurumi	"It's fiiiiine. Let's just continue talking
like this."	
Message	Shido	"Talking, huh... I mean, I guess, but... What are
we going to talk about?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, you decide. Anything is fun when it's
with you."	
Message	Shido	"What? I have to decide? Well I guess, but if we
talk a bit, will you get off me?"	
Message	Shido	So, what should we talk about?	
Choice		Studying.	
Choice		Food.	
Choice		Perverted things.	
Message	Shido	"It's almost time for our exams. Have you been
studying?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, not really. But if you pay attention in class,
the tests aren't too hard."	
Message	Shido	Hmm. I guess you're a different type than I am.	
Message	Kurumi	"But I'm not too good with numbers, so please study
with me next time."	
Message	Shido	"You're really not good with numbers? You'd better
not be looking for more excuses to hold onto me..."	
Message	Kurumi	No, I'm serious.	
Message	Shido	Then you want to start studying now?	
Message	Kurumi	Absolutely not. Now it's time to be held.	
Message	None	(...I knew it. She has no intentions of studying.)	
Message	Shido	What kind of food do you like, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	So long as you'll feed me, I'll eat anything.	
Message	Shido	"I see. But it's hard to know what to make if you
just say anything."	
Message	Kurumi	Heh. Shido-san. Ahhhh. Feed me.	
Message	Shido	Is that what you meant?	
Message	Kurumi	Huh? What other meanings could it have?	
Message	Shido	Oh, I just took it as me making food for you.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh. You mean like feeding me through your mouth?
Hehe... Of course I wouldn't mind that."	
Message	Shido	Wait, wait, wait.	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. Shido-san. You're totally blushing right
now. How adorable. I may just eat you up,
Shido-san. Just kidding... Hehehehehehehehe..."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*...	
Message	None	"(I guess talking about food with Kurumi isn't a
good idea. What is this feeling... I sense that
my life is in danger... I wonder why?)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi. What kind of underwear do you have on?	
Message	Kurumi	My, is that what you really want to know?	
Message	Shido	"...Okay, so you're really fine with any topic,
huh... I meant it as a joke."	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, so you don't want to know, then?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, um. I guess it would be all right to hear
for reference..."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Is that so? Then...	
Message	Shido	*Gulp*...	
Message	Kurumi	I won't tell you.	
Message	Shido	I figured!	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Shido-san, you pervert.	
Message	Shido	"Ha...haha. I was kidding. But... that's still kind
of messed up."	
Message	Shido	Anyways, I kind of have to get dinner ready...	
Message	Kurumi	What?! No! I haven't had enough yet!	
Message	Shido	"But at this rate, I won't be able to get
anything done."	
Message	Kurumi	Still, I don't want such an abhorrent thing.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, it's time for you to go home, right?	
Message	Kurumi	...I want to be with you all day.	
Message	Shido	Come on, don't be like that.	
Message	Kurumi	I don't want to leave you... Don't you understand?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but you still have to go home eventually,
you know?"	
Message	Kurumi	...I can spend the night tonight.	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Don't tell me you were planning to do
that from the beginning, and that's why you
changed your clothes?"	
Message	Kurumi	I don't know about that.	
Message	Shido	"Well, there are open rooms here, so I guess I
don't mind... Anyways, I have to get ready for
dinner."	
Message	Kurumi	Aww. Noooo.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, let go of me.	
Message	Kurumi	"Let's get food delivered. That way you can hold me
the whole time."	
Message	Shido	Y-You'd go to that extent?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I want to be with you allllllll the time.	
Message	Shido	Hm. I guess we can't help it, then...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... Shido-saaaan.	
Message	Shido	"But there's nothing to do if we just stay like
this. What do we do next? You still want to
talk about something?"	
Message	Kurumi	Pet me...	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Kurumi	I want you to pet my head, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Pet you...?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes.	
Message	Shido	L-Like this...?	
Message	Kurumi	Mmmmmmm...	
Message	Shido	...Like this?	
Message	Kurumi	Yeess. It feels good. I want you to keep doing it.	
Message	Shido	...Here I go.	
Message	Kurumi	Ahh... I feel so happy...	
Message	Shido	Haha, you're so affectionate.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... I know. Your Kurumi is very affectionate.	
Message	Shido	Well... I guess it's not bad?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	What is it, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... I love you so much.	
Message	Shido	"*Groan*... I wonder why... My heart feels a bit
strange... Something about this just doesn't seem
right..."	
Message	Kurumi	Not at all. Shido-san, you'll be with me forever.	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay... Yeah... That's right. You've always been
like this, huh Kurumi? And from now on, too..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes, we'll be together forever. Let's eat dinner
like this."	
Message	Shido	Right. I guess I'll have to order delivery.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... You'll hold me the whole time, won't you?	
Message	Shido	Jeez... I guess.
