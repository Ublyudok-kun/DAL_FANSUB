Message	None	"(In the silence of night, I opened my heavy
mouth.)"	
Message	Shido	This is it, Tohka.	
Message	None	"(Tohka was staring at the floor, but she
gasped as she looked up.)"	
Message	Tohka	What...? Why? WHY, SHIDO?!	
Message	None	"(Her eyes flashed from bewilderment.
I watched as her lips trembled, and the
color began to drain from her face.)"	
Message	None	"(But all I could do was shake my head
weakly.)"	
Message	Shido	"I hope you understand. You're not a child,
anymore."	
Message	Tohka	NO! I don't want to!	
Message	Tohka	"I cannot bear the thought of us breaking
apart!"	
Message	Shido	I don't want to either, but...!	
Message	None	"(I cut myself off, knowing there wasn't
anything else to say. Not in one breath.)"	
Message	None	(The cruel truth. It was impossible to say.)	
Message	Shido	This is the end for us...	
Message	Shido	"Please understand. I don't... I don't want to
say this either!"	
Message	Shido	But... I have to.	
Message	Shido	I can't be with you anymore.	
Message	None	"(The words wretched out of my mouth
like blood.)"	
Message	Shido	So, I have to say good-bye, Tohka.	
Message	None	"(Tohka froze. With a barely audible voice,
she asked.)"	
Message	Tohka	You really have to...?	
Message	Shido	I really do.	
Message	None	"(It's hard, but I gotta be tough. If I don't
part ways with Tohka now, there will be
no tomorrow for us.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked up, as if I was flinging away
my doubts!)"	
Message	Shido	"It can't be helped. We've made it in front
of the house."	
Message	Tohka	Aw...	
Message	None	We made it to Tohka's apartment.	
Message	None	"(Tohka's place was literally next door to mine.
Being near her front door was practically like
being home.)"	
Message	None	"(Making her walk back by herself seemed
cold, so whenever she had dinner at ours,
I escorted our home.)"	
Message	None	"(But the layout of our neighborhood makes
it almost not even worth the trip.)"	
Message	Shido	No point in pouting, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Boo...	
Message	Shido	That won't work on me, either.	
Message	Shido	"We have school tomorrow, so you need to
go home."	
Message	Tohka	...Okay, fine. I suppose it is unavoidable.	
Message	None	(Tohka was despondent, but nodded.)	
Message	Tohka	Anyways, Shido, how was today's separation?	
Message	Shido	Hm. Not too shabby.	
Message	Shido	"What would really make it a good drama is
the right BGM, and maybe a teary moment,
right?"	
Message	Shido	I feel like we went overboard a bit.	
Message	Tohka	Really? I quite enjoyed myself.	
Message	None	"(After escorting her countless times, we've
started spicing up our good-byes.)"	
Message	None	"(We try to make it as dramatic as possible
when we say good-bye, acting out a scene
before sending each other off.)"	
Message	None	(Today's theme was "The Final Farewell".)	
Message	None	"(I know, it's pretty silly of me. But acting
is pretty fun, so we made a thing out of it.)"	
Message	None	"(The others told us we were being a dumb,
lovey-dovey couple again. But who cares?
We were having fun.)"	
Message	Tohka	So, how would you assess today's performance?	
Message	Shido	Hm...	
Message	None	(Tohka's eyes were lit with hope.)	
Message	None	(I watched them flicker with a wry grin.)	
Message	Shido	All right. I'll give you 80 points!	
Message	Tohka	WHOA! YAY!	
Message	None	(She raised both of her arms in celebration.)	
Message	None	"(Of course, the scoring is totally arbitrary.
I don't evaluate it in any way. But for Tohka,
it's a big deal.)"	
Message	None	(Tohka hummed, and her eyes glowed.)	
Message	Tohka	"Since I received 80 points, I can request
one dish for lunch tomorrow, right?"	
Message	None	"(This is what boils down to. Whenever she
gets above 80, she can request what she
wants for lunch. That was the bet.)"	
Message	None	"(Anything less than 50 means I can add one
additional vegetable. Tohka pouts like a sad
puppy when she loses, but I love it.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, a deal's a deal. What do you want?	
Message	Tohka	I request bacon-wrapped asparagus!	
Message	Shido	"Ah, perfect. I've got leftovers of each.
Okay then. I'll prepare it tomorrow."	
Message	Tohka	Okay! I eagerly anticipate tomorrow!	
Message	None	"(She's so easy to please. It's only lunch,
but that's what makes Tohka so special.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right. Now that lunch for tomorrow is
settled, we can call it a night."	
Message	Tohka	Yes. I quite enjoyed today, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Same here.	
Message	None	"(Tohka smiled without hesitation, which
made me smile in turn.)"	
Message	None	"(It was, by all accounts, an unremarkable
day. Went to school, left school. Helped
Tohka studied, and enjoyed dinner.)"	
Message	None	"(Then, we enjoyed a bit of TV, played some
games, and then I walked her home.)"	
Message	None	"(Nothing remarkable, but it was everything
we wanted and more.)"	
Message	None	(All thanks to having Tohka at my side.)	
Message	Shido	Tohka, I love you.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing...	
Message	None	"(It wasn't anything in particular. It slipped
out.)"	
Message	Shido	"I just wanted to tell you that. Sorry for the
surprise."	
Message	Tohka	I see. I love you too, Shido.	
Message	None	"(She said it so casually that, at first, I almost
missed what she said.)"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	I wanted to say it too. Did you not like it?	
Message	Shido	Of course not.	
Message	Tohka	Then, me neither.	
Message	None	(Tohka gave a soft laugh.)	
Message	Tohka	"Nothing could ever deter me when you speak
life into our love. I want you to say it any time,
anywhere."	
Message	Tohka	"Tomorrow, the day after. Moments after we
say good-bye, I want you to say it. I will echo
the words. As often as they bear repeating."	
Message	Shido	Tohka, thank you...	
Message	Tohka	Mm...	
Message	None	"(She is so dear to me that I find it impossible
to stop from hugging her, and she embraced
me as well.)"	
Message	None	"(Ah. She's so warm. It calms the seas in my
heart.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, see you tomorrow, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Yes, tomorrow! Good-bye until then!	
Message	None	"(Tohka waved me good-bye while a smile, and
I reciprocated.)"	
Message	None	"(Our good-byes aren't permanent. It is a
promise to see one another again. A promise,
intimated by our parting wave.)"
