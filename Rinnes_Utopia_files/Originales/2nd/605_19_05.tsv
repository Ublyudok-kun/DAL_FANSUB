Message	Shido	She's late...	
Message	None	"(I looked at my watch and muttered again for the
umpteenth time.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori!	
Message	Shido	"Are you ready yet? We need to go soon, or we won't
make it in time."	
Message	Kotori	Ahhh. Hold on, hold on～!	
Message	None	"(I heard her running all over the house. Eventually,
she jumped out with a travel bag.)"	
Message	Kotori	Sorry, sorry, Thanks for waiting, Shido! Let's go.	
Message	None	"(Kotori was out of breath, and her trademark ribbon
twitched.)"	
Message	Shido	You sure dressed up, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, could you tell?	
Message	Kotori	I mean, I'm able to go on a trip with you!	
Message	None	(Kotori smiled happily and twirled on the spot.)	
Message	Shido	If you were that excited, then that makes me happy.	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. It seems like you couldn't sleep much last
night, either."	
Message	None	(Kotori said it with a bit of a mean look.)	
Message	Shido	I couldn't help it. I was excited, too.	
Message	Kotori	Like the day before a school picnic? 	
Message	Shido	More than that.	
Message	None	"(If I'm going to travel with just Kotori, then of course
I'd be excited about it.)"	
Message	None	"(I was so excited last night that I couldn't sleep
and overslept this morning.)"	
Message	Kotori	"But it's all thanks to you that we can go on a trip
like this."	
Message	Shido	Well, I wouldn't say it's thanks to me.	
Message	None	"(Although Kotori and I are able to go out today, it
wasn't that easy.)"	
Message	None	"(Both Kotori and I are underage, so an overnight trip
required approvals.)"	
Message	None	"(Since our midterms were coming up, we could only get
approval if we got better grades.)"	
Message	None	"(So I had Kotori tutor me, but she was so intense...
I guess to having a younger person tutor you isn't
something to be particularly proud of...)"	
Message	None	"(The biggest worry on the day of the test was whether
I could get to school on time. That was pretty much
it.)"	
Message	Shido	"I guess it's thanks to you, Kotori... So I appreciate
your help."	
Message	Kotori	That kind of sounded half-assed.	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine, though. You worked hard for me, Shido. And
that makes me happy."	
Message	Kotori	"You also kept your promise of us going on a trip alone.
Thanks, Shido."	
Message	Shido	I needed to do that much, at least.	
Message	None	"(I don't remember when, but I was the one who made
that promise to her. Whether I'm her brother or her
boyfriend, I have to keep my word.)"	
Message	None	"(Anyways, we got the approvals we needed, so we're
going to have fun!)"	
Message	Shido	All right, let's get going. Do you have everything?	
Message	Kotori	"Hold on. Okay, so a change of clothes, snacks, a guide
book, and airplane tickets."	
Message	Kotori	Okay, we have it all.	
Message	Kotori	Okay, let's go.	
Message	None	(Kotori reached her hand out, and I took it in mine.)	
Message	None	"(We held hands and started to walk. Kotori really
looked happy.)"	
Message	Kotori	Hey Shido. Let's plan for the next trip, okay?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. We're just starting the first one. You're
getting ahead of yourself."	
Message	Kotori	"What gives? There are so many more places I want to
go."	
Message	Kotori	"And you'll keep your promise, right Shido? That's even
more of a reason to start planning now."	
Message	Kotori	"The next one, and the next one, and all the trips
we're going to plan for a lifetime."	
Message	Kotori	"Of course you'll be coming with me on every single
one of them."	
Message	Kotori	"No matter where I go, you'll always be with me, Shido!
And by the way, this isn't an order."	
Message	Shido	Then what is it?	
Message	Kotori	A favor.	
Message	Shido	"A favor instead of an order, huh... That makes me
happy."	
Message	Kotori	Why?	
Message	Shido	Because you always order me around.	
Message	Kotori	"You have a point. But this is a favor... and a
promise. Got it?"	
Message	None	(Kotori wrapped her pinky around mine.)	
Message	Kotori	I love you, Shido. So much. Forever and ever.	
Message	Shido	"I love you too, Kotori. I love you so much. Let's be
together forever."	
Message	Kotori	Okay. And this won't be our last trip either, okay?	
Message	Shido	Of course. Maybe the next one can be our honeymoon.	
Message	Kotori	G-Gosh! Where did that come from?!	
Message	Shido	Haha... Sorry.	
Message	None	"(Under the bright sky, we made a new promise to each
other.)"
