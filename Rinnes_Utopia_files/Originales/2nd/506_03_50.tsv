Message	Shido	Man, it sure is late.	
Message	Shido	"I was just so focused on my errands, I lost track of
time. I'm getting hungry so I should hurry home."	
Message	None	"(Oh... There aren't many people around, so it feels
kind of lonely. Oh, well. This is the shortcut, so
I'll keep going.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hm... Who are they? They seem to be wearing the
same uniform as mine. But they don't seem to be
going home. What are they doing here?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't recognize them, but... It's dangerous to be
out so late. I'll tell them to hurry home."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you guys. This area's pretty dangerous when it
gets dark. You should hurry home."	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Hey, you. Who do you think you're talking to?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Sigh. Seems about right. He must think we are two
simple girls."	
Message	Shido	...Uh.	
Message	None	"(Seems like I made the wrong move, approaching them.
They're really cute, like models or idols. But they're
kind of weird.)"	
Message	None	"(But I mean, I started the conversation for a reason.
I can't just leave these cute girls wandering out and
about like this without saying something, right?)"	
Message	Shido	"You guys are students at Raizen High, right? It's
dangerous for you to be out this late. I'll escort you
guys to somewhere better lit."	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... I hear you. Can't you tell there is no need?	
Message	Shido	"Well, at least let me see you guys off. I feel bad
just leaving."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. You're worried about us. It's kind that
you'd go to the trouble for us. However..."	
Message	Kaguya	"There's no need for that. We're the dangerous ones out
here."	
Message	Kaguya	"We are a family of the night. This darkness is our
heaven. The silence is our territory. ...You are just
some sad prey that wandered across our path."	
Message	Shido	Um... Excuse me?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, are you doing some kind of role-play activity?
It's still dangerous, so just call it quits for today."	
Message	Yuzuru	Chuckle. Kaguya. He totally doesn't get it.	
Message	Kaguya	"Sh-Shut up. We're not playing pretend, nor is it a
play. Yuzuru, stop laughing and help!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. Very well. Listen, you human. We are not
weak women. We are evil, human-eating monsters."	
Message	Yuzuru	And you shall be our prey.	
Message	Shido	...Wh-What?!	
Message	Kaguya	"It's not that different from what I said earlier! Why's
mine no good, but Yuzuru's got you all surprised?!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well. It was different because of how serious she
was. Yours sounded like a gag."	
Message	Kaguya	I-I was serious. I was thinking of it seriously...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Reassurance. There, there. Kaguya, the things that
others pity about you are also what make you
adorable."	
Message	Shido	"Um... You're kidding, right? You guys don't look evil.
Adorable monsters like you two?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Very well. Then let us show you proof.
Kaguya."	
Message	Kaguya	Huh, me?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. That's right. Kaguya, this is your chance
to redeem yourself."	
Message	Kaguya	Hmph. I guess if you put it that way. Hey, human...!	
Message	Shido	Human...? I have a name. It's Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Kaguya	"Very well. Then, Shido. I will show you the beauty of
the descendants of the night."	
Message	Shido	The beauty of what?	
Message	Kaguya	"Once you've met our eyes, your heart will be stolen
and you will become our slave. Eat this...!"	
Message	Kaguya	...Ahaaaan... Ufuuuun.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Yuzuru	Pity... That was pretty bad.	
Message	Shido	W-Well then, I'm going to go home.	
Message	Kaguya	"H-Hey, wait. What do you mean? What's going on?
Hey, Yuzuruuuuuu?!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Sigh. Right back at you. That wasn't beauty at all.
"Ahaaan"? Seriously? Don't be a fool."	
Message	Kaguya	"Sh-Shut up! I'm not on my A-game today! Shido, don't
go home!"	
Message	Shido	"No, I've had enough. Sorry for bothering you guys.
See you..."	
Message	Kaguya	Wait. One more time! Let me try one more time.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Advice. Kaguya, if you can't do it, I suggest you not
offer it. Besides, I'm hungry."	
Message	None	(*sigh* What should I do? I can't deal with them forever.)	
Choice		Urge them to stop messing around and go home.	
Choice		Hang out with them just a little longer.	
Message	Shido	"Hey guys. It's late. Why don't you continue your
role-playing tomorrow? I want to go home now."	
Message	Kaguya	Waahhh. So messed up. Yuzuru, he won't accept it.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Laugh. What part of you can he accept, though? It's
because you're not taking it seriously. Sorry that you
had to witness this."	
Message	Shido	"No, it's fine. If your house is nearby, I can walk you
guys."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Refusal. There is no need for that. Kaguya, let's stop
playing and show him our true powers."	
Message	Kaguya	*Grunt*... Very well. I'll show you our true powers.	
Message	Shido	Huh? True powers...?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Clarity. Shido, let me show you. Our true nature and
the power of the darkness."	
Message	Kaguya	Watch carefully!	
Message	Shido	"Fine, fine. Just one more time, okay? Once you're
done, be sure to go home. Got it?"	
Message	Kaguya	YAY!	
Message	Kaguya	 ...Hey, wait! You can only talk like that for so long!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Reassurance. There, there, Kaguya. Well, I guess we
might as well show him our powers while we're here."	
Message	Shido	Huh...? What are they talking about?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analysis. What we've been talking about isn't a joke.
Everything is truth, based on reality."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Addendum. Although... Kaguya does not yet possess the
power of attraction."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe. Little did you know you were lured into this
place. You'd best curse your own bad luck. I'm going
to make you regret laughing at me."	
Message	Yuzuru	Snigger. You asked for it, Kaguya. Anyways, let's go.	
Message	Kaguya	Just watch us!	
Message	Shido	What?! They transformed...?!	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. What do you say? Aren't you surprised?	
Message	Kaguya	I'm not going to forgive you, even if you cry and beg.	
Message	Shido	Y-You really were monsters.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. If you're going to call us something, call us
succubi."	
Message	Shido	Succubi...?	
Message	Kaguya	"That's right. We are of the clan of the night, feeding
off of humans like yourself."	
Message	Shido	You eat humans? Then, you're going to eat me too...?	
Message	Kaguya	Yes indeed. Did you think we were kidding?	
Message	Shido	W-Whoa! Don't eat me! I don't want to be eaten alive.	
Message	Kaguya	You don't know anything...	
Message	Shido	Huh? ...Wh-What do you mean?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Explanation. We don't steal the human's flesh. We take
their life as a whole. We eat their spirit."	
Message	Kaguya	We succubi only want a fresh male sacrifice.	
Message	Shido	A fresh male spirit...? What do you mean by that?	
Message	Kaguya	"W-Well. If I were to steal it fresh from a male, it's one
thing, right?"	
Message	Shido	I still don't get it...	
Message	Kaguya	Well, um... That is that.	
Message	Shido	Well, what is it? Don't hide it, tell me.	
Message	Kaguya	Y-Yuzuru! Shido is bullying me!	
Message	Yuzuru	"*Sigh*... If you're embarrassed, then don't tell him.
A succubus essentially gives provocative dreams to
men and then steals their lives."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Summary. Even if you're dumb, you'd know what
I mean, right?"	
Message	Shido	"S-So basically, you're some kind of erotic monster?!
More than that... You're embarrassed about explaining
it?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Shut up, shut up. You watch. I'm going to make you
cry like a sweet little baby."	
Message	Shido	Y-You sure are weird. You don't get it, do you?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Addendum. Kaguya was the one that cried like a sweet
little baby."	
Message	Kaguya	"Shut up! Just start it already! Yuzuru, you said you
were hungry!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Sorry Shido, but I'm going to have to quiet
you down."	
Message	None	"(Wh-What the...?! The moment they surrounded me,
I started to feel weak.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hahaaa. This is the power of the succubus. It's called
an energy drain. I bet you anything you feel weak
right now."	
Message	Shido	Y-You're right. I don't have any strength at all...!	
Message	Yuzuru	Accepted. Now, Yuzuru will take this.	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, no fair! Th-Then I'll... take energy from here.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey. Don't put your hand in there.	
Message	None	"(I felt weak as each succubus' hands traveled
around my body. Their fingertips grazed my skin,
and my will to fight was slipping away.)"	
Message	None	"(This really isn't going to end well. All I did was
approach them with good intentions. I was only worried
about their safety.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... You were bratty, but your spirit tastes
pretty good."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Heavenly. I feel like I'm going to melt. Hehe. Shido,
don't worry. I won't take your life."	
Message	Kaguya	"You can sleep until your life ends in the dream we
will show you."	
Message	Shido	H-Help me!	
Message	None	"(Eventually, my fatigued body experienced the
illusions of the body-melting phantoms. I guess I
won't be waking up for a while.)"
