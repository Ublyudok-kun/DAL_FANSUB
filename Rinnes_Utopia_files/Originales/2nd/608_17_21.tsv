Message	None	"(I took quite a bit of time shopping. I better
hurry home. I wonder if Maria made it home
safely.)"	
Message	Arusu	......	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? That's... Maria, I think. She should've
made it home by now."	
Message	Shido	Heeey, Maria.	
Message	Arusu	......	
Message	Shido	Wha? Where'd she go? What was that?	
Message	Shido	"That... was Maria, I think.
I may have made a mistake."	
Message	Shido	It's bothering me. I'll go after her.	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	"Damn it. I should've left my shopping bags
behind."	
Message	Shido	This is... Takadai Park.	
Message	None	"(Takadai Park. There stood the figure of an
artificial Spirit looking up at the sky, gazing
beyond.)"	
Message	None	"(Strangely enough, it was a familiar sight to
me. Maria... looking up at the starry sky.
That figure.)"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	Arusu	"Ahh. So you came here after all. As expected,
Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	? Are you... Maria?	
Message	Arusu	If that is what you think, then so be it.	
Message	Shido	No. You're very similar, but different.	
Message	Arusu	Hmmm, I wonder why that is?	
Message	Shido	She's not one to look so testy.	
Message	Arusu	"I see. So you believe in Maria Arusu. The
one who has changed."	
Message	Shido	Changed? What are you talking about?	
Message	Arusu	"Just something to do with me. For you, it
might be a small thing, but it is very big to
me."	
Message	Shido	Like I asked, who exactly are you?	
Message	Arusu	"Arusu. I am Arusu. Okay then, farewell.
See you later, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Whoa! So bright!	
Message	Shido	"That light just now―
Wait, Maria?"	
Message	Shido	She's gone. What was that...?	
Message	Shido	"That wasn't Maria, was it? No...
Then who was it?"	
Message	None	"(For me, right now, there's so much I don't
know.)"	
Message	None	"(I saw Maria, clad in black, on my way home.
It was a mysterious encounter.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm home.	
Message	Shido	Maria? Were you home this whole time?	
Message	Maria	Yes. What is the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Um, just a moment ago, at Takadai Park...
You weren't there, were you?"	
Message	Maria	I came straight here.	
Message	Shido	You didn't leave at all, right?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Shido, the intentions behind your line
of questioning are unclear."	
Message	Shido	No. Sorry, it's nothing.	
Message	None	"(So that really wasn't Maria just now?
Even if I pressed further, she doesn't seem
to know.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! You were quite late. Where were you?
I am famished!"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, sorry, sorry. I'll get dinner ready now, so
wait just a second."	
Message	Tohka	Hm! All right!	
Message	Maria	Shido, you appear to be deep in thought.	
Message	Shido	"No, it's nothing. I think I was just mistaken
about something, so don't worry."	
Message	Maria	I understand.	
Message	Shido	"Over there, huh? Did she mean the navigator
position?"	
Message	None	"(There's Maria here, and the Maria that I just
met. Maybe she has multiple personalities...?
It's a possibility.)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	None	"(As I figured, thinking won't give me any
answers. There's too much I don't know.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, for now, it can wait until later.
