Message	Shido	WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!	
Message	Yoshino	"Yoshinon... is my precious... precious friend. But I
have faith... that you'll make her happy, Shido-
san...!"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, why are you teary-eyed... I mean, Yoshinon and
me married?! How?! WHY?!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, come on, Shido-kun. We've loved one another\nso passionately. You were the one who proposed to\nme, remember?"	
Message	Yoshino	Please... be happy... *sob*...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Now, now! My sweet darling, I want you to give me\na deep kiss like you usually do ♪"

Message	Yoshino	AHHHH?!	
Message	Shido	*pant*... *pant, pant*... H-Huh? A-A... dream?	
Message	Yoshinon	"What's the matter, Shido-kun? You were groaning."	
Message	Yoshino	"And you're... sweating a lot... Did you have... a
nightmare?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Well, I guess you could say that.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmmm. Then take a good look at adorable Yoshinon's\nface and calm down. Come on. What do you say?"	
Message	None	"(I-I couldn't bring myself to say that Yoshinon... was
the cause of my nightmare.)"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Thanks...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Why are you being so shy? It's just you and me."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(I remembered the dream I just had, and I looked
away.)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... Are you okay...?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... Sorry. It was just a weird dream. Or rather,
it was surprising."	
Message	Yoshinon	"If you say so, Shido-kun. It sure must have been a\nweird one."	
Message	Yoshino	...What kind of dream was it?	
Message	Shido	Oh... um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"You just looked at Yoshinon and looked away, didn't\nyou? Considering that... Shido-kun... Did you have a\nnaughty dream?	
Message	Shido	NO! Not at all!	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... You didn't...?	
Message	Shido	"No... I wish I had. Then I wouldn't be so stressed
out..."	
Message	Yoshino	...Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Yoshinon	"I see. Then what kind of dream was it?"	
Message	Shido	"...To put it simply... Uh, I had a dream... of marrying
someone that wasn't you, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Then... Who... did you get married to?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Tohka-chan? Kotori-chan? Or Kaguya-chan or\nYuzuru-chan? Or even Miku-chan?"	
Message	Shido	"All wrong... Is it even a girl? Well... I guess it
is... a girl.""	
Message	Yoshino	...So who... did you dream... you got married to?	
Message	Shido	"It was someone I could never marry under normal
circumstances."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmm. I don't get it. So basically, Shido-kun, you had\na fantasy dream that made you groan?"	
Message	Shido	Something like that...	
Message	Yoshino	Is something wrong...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I was just wondering how you came to wake me
up... "	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... Sorry for entering your room without
permission..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"But don't worry, we got Kotori-chan's permission.\nI hope you forgive us."	
Message	Shido	"...I want to say it's fine, but considering what just
happened, I'm embarrassed that you saw me sleeping."	
Message	None	"(Not only that, but after a dream like the one I just
had, I don't even know how I should be acting right
now. I might have even talked in my sleep...)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Then why don't you see Yoshi's sleeping face?\nThen it'd be even."	
Message	Shido	But Yoshino wouldn't like that, right?	
Message	Yoshino	"Th-That's not true... Although I would be a bit
embarrassed..."	
Message	Shido	...I see.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah, yeah. Can't be helped right? Yoshino doesn't\nlet her guard down in front of you, Shido-kun. You'd\nlike to see her so defenseless, huh?"	
Message	Shido	...Yeah, yeah. Someday.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, you're so apathetic. You could be a little more\ninterested in Yoshino, you know?"	
Message	Shido	"What's the point in being interested in things people
don't want you to be interested in? Anyways, I'm going
to go change, so wait for me in the living room."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay. Um, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Yoshino	...Good morning.	
Message	Shido	Ah... Good morning.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino smiled and left the room. I noticed myself
being enchanted by her, and I snapped out of it.)"	
Message	Shido	Today is going to be a good day.	
Message	None	"(I'm not sure about the dream, but Yoshino woke me
up. I have a feeling something good will happen
today.)"
