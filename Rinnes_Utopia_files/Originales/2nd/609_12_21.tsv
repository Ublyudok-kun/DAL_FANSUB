Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido. When's breakfast gonna be done?	
Message	Shido	Sorry, it'll be done soon!	
Message	None	"(In the living room, everyone was gathered,
eagerly awaiting breakfast. It was a struggle
to prepare such large amounts of food.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, the eggs are done frying.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Thank you, Maria. I'm done on my end,
too."	
Message	None	"(Thanks to Maria's assistance, it looks like
we were able to complete preparations.)"	
Message	Shido	"There, it's done. Heeeeey, everyone～!
Breakfast is ready!"	
Message	Tohka	Oooh, I have been waiting!	
Message	Kurumi	"You really have a big appetite, don't you
Tohka-san? It's impressive, I must admit."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. It is embarrassing to be complimented
for it."	
Message	Yoshino	"Th-That's... I'm not sure she's complimenting
you."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Tohka-chan sure seems cheerful, so it's all\ngood, right?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh. The rays of dawn coupled with
the gleam of the shining sun, as if the sun
itself were melting from the heat."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. Fried eggs with runny yolk
are absolutely delicious."	
Message	Shido	"Ohh, I see. Maria's the one who fried the
eggs. Great job, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Yes. I'm glad.	
Message	Origami	"Shido's meals are always top-notch. If you
were to go by Michelin ratings, it would add
up to seven stars."	
Message	Shido	"No, no. The highest is three, right?! If it were
seven stars, it'd be like that guy with the scar
on his chest."	
Message	Origami	I simply mean your food is amazing.	
Message	Miku	"More importantly, if we don't eat quickly,
the breakfast that darling and Maria went
through the trouble to make will cool."	
Message	Maria	"That would not be an ideal situation. Meals
are best eaten at the proper temperature."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Arusu-chan really has become a glutton,\ntoo～!"	
Message	Shido	"What Maria says is true. Well, everyone's
ready, so let's eat."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I cannot wait to dig in!	
Message	Tohka	"Whew. Another delicious feast! Thank you
for the meal."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, it was tasty and exquisite. Now,
since breakfast is done, you and I have a
date scheduled today～."	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm? Why is it with you, Miku?! Shido will
be going on a date with me!"	
Message	Yoshino	M-Maybe... once in a while, I, um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right～! You should date Yoshino\ntoo, Shido-kun!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmhm. If you prefer, why not have a more...
mature date with me? One you couldn't have
with the other girls, no?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh heh heh. Shido has formed a pact with the
Yamai Sisters to partake in a merry banquet."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. It is unfair that you often date
Maria. I would like some attention, is what
Kaguya was saying last night."	
Message	Kaguya	I-I-I never said that!	
Message	Origami	"Yesterday, we performed activities as a group.
Therefore, Shido's date should be with me."	
Message	Kotori	"Oniiii-chan, why not take me out once in a
while?"	
Message	Shido	What the—?! Kotori, what are you saying?!	
Message	Kotori	"I'm kidding. Hey everyone, before you go
staking your claim, aren't you all forgetting
something important?"	
Message	Tohka	Something important...?	
Message	Miku	"Am I missing something～? We're discussing
who darling should go on a date with. Today,
I would like to go out, just the two of us."	
Message	Origami	I second her statement.	
Message	Kotori	You guys—	
Message	Maria	"You cannot. Shido promised to take me on
a date."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Is that true, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Er, well... Um...	
Message	Maria	"Just for today, allow me to be selfish.
This is the request of a lifetime."	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?	
Message	Maria	Let's depart, Shido. This is... for you and me.	
Message	Maria	Our final date.	
Message	Shido	...Huh? What did you say?	
Message	Maria	It is nothing. Now, let us go.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, hey...!	
Message	None	"(Maria pulled me by the hand. She used a
lot of force. Almost like desperation.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry, everyone. 	
Message	Tohka	"Yes. After seeing how serious Maria is,
I cannot object."	
Message	Origami	"I acknowledge that. But tomorrow I won't give
up."	
Message	Yoshino	Please... Go with her!	
Message	Kurumi	Make sure you care for Maria-san properly.	
Message	Kaguya	Heh heh... I leave my underling to you, Maria.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. I sense determination in you,
Maria."	
Message	Miku	"It's true. A fire is burning behind those eyes.
So, for today... I mean, also today, be sure to
care for Maria-chan."	
Message	Kotori	That's right. Do your best, Shido.	
Message	Maria	"Everyone, thank you. Please... Forgive me
for being selfish."	
Message	Shido	Let me thank you too, everyone.	
Message	Shido	Still, it's surprising.	
Message	Maria	...Sorry, but it is only for today.	
Message	Shido	No, it's fine, but...	
Message	None	"(She looks conflicted. What do I do?
Do I ask her what's going on?)"	
Choice		Did something happen?	
Choice		All right. Let's go!	
Message	Shido	Maria, did something happen?	
Message	Maria	Something...? How do you mean?	
Message	Shido	Er, well... You're acting kinda weird.	
Message	Maria	...Weird? Is there something wrong with me?	
Message	Shido	"I didn't mean it like that. I just wondered if
maybe you were worried."	
Message	Maria	"No, that is not the case. I simply wished to
go on a date with you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. I see. Sorry. Guess it was just my
imagination."	
Message	None	"(Just as I thought, there's something off.
But it doesn't seem like she wants me to
ask. For now, I'll tag along with Maria.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's go!	
Message	Maria	"Shido, were you about to say something just
now?"	
Message	Shido	"It's fine. Don't worry. After all, you're inviting
me on a date, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Thank you, Shido. I can't wait.	
Message	Shido	Then, let's get out there, Maria.	
Message	Maria	...Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Now then. Where should we go on our date?
Have anything in mind, Maria?"	
Message	Maria	I want to visit a variety of places.	
Message	Shido	A variety of places, huh... That's tough.	
Message	Maria	"We needn't go very far, or to a special place.
All I wish, put simply, is to spend time with
you in this town, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Maria...? Okay. Let me think. Okay, let's hit as
many places as we can!"	
Message	Maria	Okay!	
Message	Shido	"We've been to almost all of the shops around
here, haven't we? The clothing store, the
convenience store..."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It was rather enjoyable. Let's visit stores
you would normally visit, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Stores I normally visit? Hm, there's the book
store, or... Oh, I guess maybe the supermarket?"	
Message	Maria	"The place we visited before everyone cooked
a meal together, yes?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I remember that... Wait, when was
that?"	
Message	None	"(I somewhat remember doing it, but I can't
recall any of the details. It's a little surreal.)"	
Message	Maria	"...! I apologize. Please do not worry about it.
This world contains much data on a plethora
of events."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you're referencing something that happened
inside of the game. I guess it's not weird that
I'm good at cooking. Not everyone can handle it."	
Message	Maria	"Please look there, Shido. That is a food cart,
yes?"	
Message	Shido	It looks like okonomiyaki. Want to try some?	
Message	Maria	"Yes, I would... There are still so many things
I do not know. Food is especially remarkable."	
Message	Shido	"I agree. Then let's split an okonomiyaki,
and maybe sample other foods together."	
Message	Maria	"Yes, let's. If we split a meal between us, then
we can eat more than usual. Just like when
we visited the café."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. You're right. Kotori usually eats whatever
she wants, then hands me the leftovers."	
Message	Maria	"I see. It certainly sounds like Kotori. Hee hee.
Now that we've decided, let's go, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, hey. No need to rush!	
Message	Shido	"We just checked out the clothing store, didn't
we?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Now that I recall, I have not worn the
clothes you had bought me since then."	
Message	Shido	Oh. I guess you're right.	
Message	Maria	"After you went through the trouble of
purchasing me such a cute outfit, I
should have worn it today."	
Message	Shido	"Ahh, well, you can next time. It's not like
today is our last day together."	
Message	Maria	Yes... You're right.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Maria	No, it is nothing.	
Message	Maria	There are many girls here, yes?	
Message	Shido	"Ahh. Girls love this kind of stuff. Cute
charms, small accessories, and such."	
Message	Maria	"It is true. Somehow, just looking at them,
it is starting to feel fun."	
Message	Shido	"Since we're here, wanna buy something?
You can choose anything you want."	
Message	Maria	No, I will decline.	
Message	Shido	Really? You don't have to hold back.	
Message	Maria	There is... something else I want today.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see. Then, do you want to go and find
it?"	
Message	Maria	"No, I'm going to keep it secret until the time
is right. I will... tell you later."	
Message	Shido	Hmm? I don't really get it, but sure.	
Message	Maria	"Then, let's move onto the next place. We
don't have much time, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Whoa... Wait up, Maria. Don't run so fast!	
Message	Shido	"Whew. We went all over the place...
But did you really not want to buy anything,
Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes, Shido. I had a lovely time, even just
browsing."	
Message	Shido	Well, I understand what you mean.	
Message	Maria	Did you enjoy yourself too, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Window-shopping allows me to look
at things I'm curious about but would never
buy myself."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. There are many items whose purposes
are unknown to me, as are their buyers."	
Message	Shido	"You can find bargains in unexpected places, too.
That leads to new and exciting discoveries, don't
you think?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I am of the same opinion. However, to
be on the same page as you are, Shido, is...
a strange feeling."	
Message	Shido	"Really? We browsed the shops together, so
it makes sense, doesn't it?"	
Message	Maria	"It was all new information to me, but to you,
they were things you had experienced before."	
Message	Shido	"True, but... it's not like I'm always conscious
of my surroundings. There's still a lot I'm
learning too."	
Message	Maria	"Hee hee. For some reason, I feel happy.
Those are feelings I share with you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Is that something to be happy about?	
Message	Maria	Yes. It has never happened prior to right now.	
Message	Shido	...Really? It totally slipped my mind.	
Message	Maria	Slipped your mind?	
Message	Shido	"I mean like, how unique you are, Maria. To me,
you're a regular girl, the same as everyone else."	
Message	Maria	A regular... girl.	
Message	Shido	"That's right. In fact, compared to everyone
else, you've got way more common sense."	
Message	Maria	I'm... a regular girl...	
Message	Shido	Is something wrong, Maria?	
Message	Maria	...No. It is nothing.	
Message	Shido	"...? So what's the plan after this? Wanna see
a movie?"	
Message	Maria	"No, today is fine as it is. Let's visit more
places. Is that okay?"	
Message	Shido	Are you sure that's what you want?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. The objective of today's date is to
explore the city with you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Ah, right.	
Message	Maria	Indeed. Then, let's get moving.	
Message	Maria	Shido, it is a cat.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it has a collar. It might belong to someone
who lives in the neighborhood."	
Message	Cat	Meoooow.	
Message	Maria	Shido, it is approaching.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Seems like it's used to people.	
Message	Cat	Meeeeow. Meew...	
Message	Maria	What should I do for it?	
Message	Shido	Well, how about you try petting it?	
Message	Maria	"Pet... I understand. I will attempt to do so.
There, there..."	
Message	Cat	Meeeew... Meef... Meeeeeow.	
Message	None	"(As Maria pet the cat, it meowed in satisfaction,
swishing its tail before departing.)"	
Message	Maria	I wonder... if that was acceptable.	
Message	Shido	I think you did fine. It seemed pleased.	
Message	Maria	Glad to hear it...	
Message	Shido	"I really don't come here very often. It all
feels so new to me."	
Message	Maria	Almost like we're on an adventure.	
Message	Shido	It kinda does. There's a sense of mystery.	
Message	Maria	"Shido, you seem to be enjoying yourself.
Whenever you're happy, I am as well."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really? I'm a little embarrassed to hear you
say that."	
Message	Maria	"If we keep going down this route, we will
reach a place you've never seen before, right
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I've never taken this path before.
Have you, Maria?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I am of the same opinion. However, to
be on the same page as you are, Shido, is...
a strange feeling."	
Message	Shido	Well, let's keep going!	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Come what may. A view neither of us
have seen, only for the two of us."	
Message	None	"(And so, Maria and I walked around my city,
the one I had become long accustomed to.)"	
Message	None	"(Trotting around while observing the familiar
cityscape was enlightening, but also enjoyable.)"	
Message	Shido	Man, we sure are getting our exercise today!	
Message	Maria	Yes. The sun has already set.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's easy to see the stars from here.
Makes for a nice way to cap a lovely date."	
Message	Maria	Yes. Being here right now brings me serenity.	
Message	None	"(That's right. Maria loves to star-gaze.
Just like this, here and now...)"	
Message	Shido	It's pretty.	
Message	Maria	Yes. I feel as though I could stand here forever.	
Message	Shido	"Next time, it'd be nice to bring the others to
star-gaze with us. We could bring a telescope."	
Message	Maria	...	
Message	Maria	Yes... We should.	
Message	Shido	Maria, are you cold?	
Message	Maria	"It is possibly a bit chilly. It is the evening,
after all."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Then, maybe we should—	
Message	Maria	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Maria	Today was everything I could have asked for.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I had fun too.	
Message	Maria	"Shido...? Could I possibly ask you... one more
selfish request?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, of course. Tohka and the others honored
your request, so they'd probably be upset if I
didn't too."	
Message	Maria	"Hee hee. I see. For you, Shido, I'm sure it will
be easy. It is what you do at the end of a date,
after all."	
Message	Shido	What do you do at the end of a date?	
Message	Maria	"Shido, if you cannot read my subtext, then
we'll run into trouble. Listen, Shido. At the
end of a date... you usually kiss."	
Message	Shido	Er, ah...	
Message	None	"(To get them to fall for you, and kiss them...
That is the objective when dating a Spirit.)"	
Message	None	"(If Maria's existence is like a Spirit...
By kissing her, I would seal her powers, and
we might be able to escape from here.)"	
Message	None	"(However, does Maria know that's what I
want? What does she think of me?)"	
Message	None	"(She... might know. There's no way she wouldn't.
That's why... she must understand.)"	
Message	None	"(If Maria doesn't have a corporeal form,
there's a chance she could disappear.)"	
Message	None	"(If we kiss here, it's possible this would
be my final parting with Maria, right here.)"	
Message	None	"(Even so, if Maria wishes it, then I'll
have to decide.)"	
Choice		Kiss her.	
Choice		Don't kiss her.	
Message	Shido	Maria...? Do you mean...	
Message	Maria	Please, Shido... This is my last request.	
Choice		Kiss her.	
Choice		Don't kiss her after all.	
Message	Shido	But, even then! —?!	
Choice		Kiss her.	
Choice		You must kiss her.	
Message	None	"(My mind was filled with thoughts of kissing
her. It obscured my intentions, and I couldn't
refuse even if I tried...)"	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(I want to kiss her. I approached Maria, as
if I was being honed in, but I hesitated at the
last second.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido, are you... opposed to kissing me?	
Message	Shido	"I'm not against it, but I don't know if this
is the right time..."	
Message	Maria	This is... right.	
Message	Shido	I understand...	
Message	None	"(Maria closed her eyes. A perfectly-sculpted
face. When she closes her eyes, I can see how
long her eyelashes are.)"	
Message	None	"(Now that I think about it, there may have
never been a time when I could look at
Maria's face this close.)"	
Message	None	"Shido comes closer. I can feel Shido's body
heat."	
Message	None	"(What is this...? A voice, no...
A strange feeling overtakes me.)"	
Message	None	"I can hear Shido's heartbeat. The smell of his
hair. It is the same."	
Message	None	(Are these... Maria's inner thoughts?)	
Message	None	"(I placed my hand on Maria's shoulder,
feeling her tremble ever so slightly.)"	
Message	None	"Shido's face, his voice, his everything. I want
to know. I want to stay with Shido. I want to
be part of him."	
Message	None	"(As my head swirled with noise, I inched
my lips closer to Maria's...)"	
Message	None	Yes, this is how much... Shido, how much I lo—	
Message	Maria	Aah... Aah... Ah, aah! AAAAH!	
Message	Shido	Maria?! What's wrong?! What's happening?!	
Message	None	"(I was startled by a harsh noise, and for
a brief moment, I couldn't see... The world—!)"	
Message	Maria	What is this...? My powers are, aaaah!	
Message	Shido	Maria... Hey, Maria?!
