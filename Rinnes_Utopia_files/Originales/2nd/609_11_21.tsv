Message	Maria	"Friend"... Everyone has called me this.	
Message	Maria	"Shido and the others love one another,
and I do too..."	
Message	Maria	"My heart feels warm inside. This feeling is
known as happiness. This, I already know."	
Message	Maria	"But that is not all. I was able to learn about
many emotions."	
Message	Maria	"However, I...Is there anything I can do for
them in return?"	
Message	Maria	"Something that I could do, for everyone else...
would be to release them from this world."	
Message	Maria	"However, I do not know what method would
allow me to do so. Hence why I have trapped
Shido and the others here."	
Message	Maria	"I alone do not possess the answer. All I can
do... is to learn about love."	
Message	Maria	To understand love...	
Message	Maria	"That is the only piece of key information I
have. For now, it is all I have."	
Message	Maria	"In order for me to understand love... I must
proceed to the next step."	
Message	Maria	"The next step... is to seal the date.
With one method... with a kiss."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. That is right. That is how everyone
else conveyed their love to Shido. At the
end of a date, you must kiss."	
Message	Maria	"If I do that, I am sure, I will fully understand
love. If I do that, then Shido... and the others
will be released from this world."	
Message	Maria	Then, after... I release everyone?	
Message	Maria	"Kotori had said that I was an irregularity.
If everything reverts to the way it was, then
an irregularity such as myself may vanish."	
Message	Maria	"Even so, I want to be of some use. As a friend,
for the sake of everyone who treated me like
an equal."	
Message	Maria	And... for Shido's sake as well.	
Message	Maria	So, let us begin... our final Date.
