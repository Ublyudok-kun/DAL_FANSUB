Today felt especially long. I wanna get to bed
already, but I need to wash the dishes.)"	
Message	None	"(But I can't shake the sight of Maria in that
black outfit. Maybe I should find a time to
bring it up to her?)"	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	None	"(Maria is leaving through the front door.
I wonder what's wrong.)"	
Message	Shido	What are you doing, Maria? It's cold.	
Message	Maria	I am fine. I wanted to look up at the stars.	
Message	None	(Maria said this, gazing up at the night sky.)	
Message	Shido	You like star-gazing, don't you?	
Message	Maria	How did you know...?	
Message	Shido	Intuition, I guess. Just had a feeling.	
Message	None	"(The Maria I saw at Takadai Park earlier and
the one in front of me were floating. Their auras
may be different, but they are linked somehow.)"	
Message	Shido	"That's not why I asked, though. I figured you
liked looking at the stars. Am I wrong?"	
Message	Maria	You are not wrong. Although there is more to it.	
Message	Shido	"I see. If you stay out here for too long, you
might catch a cold. Let's head home."	
Message	Maria	Okay.	
Message	None	"(Maria spun on her heel and walked quietly
towards the front door. All of a sudden, I asked
her a question.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria? Do you have a family?	
Message	Maria	Family...?	
Message	Shido	For example, um... a younger or older sister?	
Message	Maria	"A sister...? No. I have no memory of such a
thing, nor are there records to indicate so."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Sorry for the weird question.	
Message	Maria	"It is fine. However, in exchange for me
accepting your date proposal, promise me
something."	
Message	Shido	Sure, what is it?	
Message	Maria	Will you invite me on a date tomorrow, too?	
Message	Shido	That's no problem at all. I promise I will.	
Message	Maria	Yes. It is a promise, yes?	
Message	Shido	"Yep. All right, then. Let's head inside the
house."	
Message	None	"(Maria returned to the house with a spring
in her step, almost like she was dancing. I
followed her inside and shut the door.)"	
Message	None	(And so, the long day had come to an end.)
