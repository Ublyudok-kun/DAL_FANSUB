Message	Shido	"Ahhh. What a nice, clear blue sky. A perfect day to
practice."	
Message	None	"(I'm at Raizen High School on my day off. The whole
place is empty, but I came here to practice as much
as I could.)"	
Message	Shido	"Shido Itsuka #4, the ace of the baseball team...
I'm still not used to this reputation. But that's more
of a reason to become a man worthy of that name."	
Message	None	"(Despite my club being on break, I came all the way
to school to practice. I guess I'm a baseball nut,
after all.)"	
Message	Shido	"But it's pretty nice being in an empty field. So open.
I guess it was worth coming out on my day off."	
Message	Shido	All right, I'll start my warm-up.	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Hold on just a moment, Shido.	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Wait a moment, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Those voices. Kaguya and Yuzuru, the managers....
What are you guys doing here? We have today off."	
Message	Kaguya	"What a foolish question. We are the right hands of the
heroic competitor. We will always be by your side at
any given time."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Response. Since we're the managers, we've come to
help you, Shido. Kaguya was eavesdropping and heard
you tell the teacher you were going to practice."	
Message	Kaguya	Hey! Yuzuru, you were listening too!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Rebuttal. Yuzuru was just trying to stop Kaguya.
Please do not put the blame on me."	
Message	Kaguya	But you were listening, too!	
Message	None	"(The two started to bicker with each other. This was
an everyday sight. It was also a signal that the
baseball team could relax.)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, I get it. I see. Thanks for coming out on your
day off."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Yuzuru is just happy to spend time with
Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, no fair! I wanted to be with Shido, too.	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. Well if that's the case, I guess I can have
you guys help me with practice."	
Message	None	"(So I started my training with the two managers ready
to help.)"	
Message	None	"(God knows what the other members are going to
do when they find out that I had the two adorable
managers to myself all day...)"	
Message	Shido	I'm going to keep today a secret.	
Message	Kaguya	What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, nothing. Oh, that's right. Listen, you guys. Don't
tell the others about today, all right?"	
Message	Kaguya	Oh, is that so? I understand.	
Message	Yuzuru	Understood. That's preferable to us as well.	
Message	Kaguya	"This is a relentless pursuit between Yuzuru and
myself."	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. No need to tell the others.	
Message	Shido	Did you say something?	
Message	Kaguya	N-Nothing!	
Message	Yuzuru	Emphasis. I'm sure you misheard.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Then can you help with getting the equipment
out? I know it'll be hard to do all at once, so maybe
we can divide it up?"	
Message	Kaguya	Understood. So what do you want us to get out?	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Well, I want to practice batting, so a lot of
balls."	
Message	Yuzuru	Understood. Shido, please head over to the grounds.	
Message	Shido	"All right. I'm ready. I was going to ask if those two
could pick up the balls, but..."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you two. Um, shouldn't you be changing? It's hard
to say this, but if you run around like that, I think
a lot of things will show... Like your underwear."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe. It's fine. That's not a big deal. I figured it'd
happen, so I'm wearing spandex shorts underneath!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Reveal. Excellent functionality, as you can see. No
problem."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay!	
Message	None	"(I know they're wearing shorts, but I don't know what
to do when they flip their skirts up like that. Aren't
they embarrassed?)"	
Message	None	"(If they're fine, I guess it's okay. But the curves
from their hips is pretty apparent... it's kind of
poisonous to the eye.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Seems like it's working. So it's true that
sportsmen are weak against spandex. I called it.
I'm not embarrassed of the Spandex Tactic!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Yuzuru was the one to come up with the
name. Kaguya just rode the bandwagon."	
Message	Kaguya	"H-Hey, I was the one that gathered the information!
Y-Yuzuru, your spandex is super lovely and it's so
not fair... but I can't give you Shido!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Kaguya, although you may look like an angel
in your spandex, I can't surrender this battle.
Shido's heart will be won by Yuzuru."	
Message	Shido	"...Seems like they're talking, but I can't hear what
they're talking about. Hey you guys, can I start now?"	
Message	Kaguya	Yeah! Come at me!	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Please start.	
Message	Shido	All right then, here I go!	
Message	None	"(The practice grounds are relatively smaller, and I
could see the balls fly left and right.)"	
Message	Shido	"That's amazing. They're picking up every single ball
and returning them to me."	
Message	None	"(I asked them to pick up the balls, but not catch them
like they're defense. But it seemed like Kaguya and
Yuzuru were competing and running after the balls.)"	
Message	Shido	"It makes me smile watching them. I almost want to
hit the balls so they can catch them... But that
spandex just won't get out of my head."	
Message	None	"(Ngh... What am I thinking of during such a wholesome
sport? Get out of here, corrupted thoughts!)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Seems like the plan is effective. I can tell
even from here that Shido is blushing from ear to ear."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. It seems like it is working. But... well...
wouldn't you say it's embarrassing for us as well?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Embarrassment. Shido's piercing hot gaze seems like
it's following us..."	
Message	Kaguya	"D-Don't say that! I'm getting embarrassed, too. Ah...
but Shido seems to be really curious."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Taunt. Are you embarrassed, Kaguya? You can retire,
if you'd like!"	
Message	Kaguya	"I'm totally not embarrassed! I-I'm totally fine! I can go
for another 100... No, 1,000 balls!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Piece of cake. I can go for 2,000.	
Message	Kaguya	Bring it on!	
Message	None	"(Hmm... I still can't make out what they're saying,
but I can tell they're blushing.)"	
Message	Shido	So they are embarrassed. Jeez, I told them!	
Message	None	"(Hmm, what should I do? This isn't good for
practicing...)"	
Message	Shido	"Seems like they're excited about other things, so I
don't think they'd stop even if I told them to."	
Message	Shido	"Fine. I guess I'll have to save them. They're both so
stubborn. I'll have to give a random excuse or they
won't budge."	
Message	None	(So what do I do?)	
Choice		Ask them to go run an errand.	
Choice		Pretend to be tired and ask for a massage.	
Message	Shido	All right guys, bring it in!	
Message	None	"(I called out to them, and the two stopped bickering
and gathered next to me.)"	
Message	Kaguya	What's the matter, Shido? We just started practice.	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. We can still continue.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah I know, but I totally messed up. I can't continue
practicing like this."	
Message	Kaguya	"Something serious enough that you can't continue
practicing?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. What was the mistake?	
Message	Shido	"Hm, well... I forgot to go shopping. I didn't bring
anything to eat or drink for lunch."	
Message	Kaguya	"...Pfft. Haha.
"	
Message	Kaguya	"Shido... You were so serious, I wasn't sure
what you were going to say."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Roger. If you're hungry, we have no other choice. It
is a manager's job to manage the players' condition."	
Message	None	(So glad. Seems like they softened up a little.)	
Message	Shido	"Good, you guys are laughing. It seemed like there was
so much tension between you two, it was starting to
bother me."	
Message	Kaguya	Oh... I see. Sorry for the trouble. I apologize.	
Message	Yuzuru	Apologies. We have failed as managers.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, hold on now. I was the one that let it get to me.
I just want you two to always be smiling and full of
energy."	
Message	Shido	That's where we players get our energy from.	
Message	None	(...Man, that was so lame of me to say.)	
Message	Shido	"Well let's go shopping. I can't do anything while I
wait, so I'll go with you."	
Message	Kaguya	"Okay, then let's compete while we shop. Yuzuru, I'm
going to win this one."	
Message	Yuzuru	Understood. Bring it on!	
Message	None	"(So it's going to end up like this after all? But it
seems like they're smiling more than earlier. Oh,
well.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, hurry! We're going to leave you behind.	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Consider this part of your training.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'm coming!	
Message	None	(I ran after my two cute managers.)	
Message	Shido	All right guys, bring it in!	
Message	None	"(I called out to them, and the two stopped bickering
and gathered next to me.)"	
Message	Kaguya	What's the matter, Shido? We just started practice.	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. We can still continue.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but I went all out and I'm already tired.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Disbelief. You're tired? But you haven't even
practiced for an hour."	
Message	Kaguya	"If we're not even tired, it's hard to believe that
you'd be, Shido. If you're saying that to look out for
us..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, wait, wait. Well I wanted to ask you guys to give
me a massage. I'm sure it'll be good practice just in
case the other members get injured right?"	
Message	Kaguya	I see...	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. That's interesting.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... A new page will be added to the history of
our battles."	
Message	Yuzuru	Return fire. I accept your challenge.	
Message	None	"(All right. I was able to shift their attention. If I let
their spandex distract me, I won't last. I'm glad to
have something to divert their focus.)"	
Message	Kaguya	All right, Shido. Let me start my shiatsu.	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kaguya. If you could do my shoulders...	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Leave it to me. Here I go, Shido!	
Message	None	(Oh. I'm starting to have a bad feeling about this.)	
Message	Kaguya	Erupt, Lightning Finger!	
Message	Shido	"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
H-Hey, Kaguya—GAH! Stop, STOP!"	
Message	Kaguya	Wh-What's the matter, Shido? Does it hurt?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well it's not about the pain. Didn't you hear some
kind of explosion right now?! I thought my shoulder
exploded."	
Message	Kaguya	S-Sorry, I seemed to have gone overboard...	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. You haven't massaged much before, huh
Kaguya? Got it, I'll teach you later. But now..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. That means that Yuzuru will win.	
Message	Kaguya	Th-That isn't set yet.	
Message	Shido	"Yuzuru, you seem confident. Then, where should I
ask next... Since my shoulders are kind of sore right
now, could you do my legs?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Understood. Shido, please sit down. I am commencing
the massage."	
Message	Shido	"Good. Yuzuru seems to be capable. I think I can trust
her."	
Message	Yuzuru	...Open eyes!	
Message	None	"(...Oh, I understand now. This isn't going to end
well.)"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yuzuru. Actually let's st―!	
Message	Yuzuru	Confidence. It'll be fine. Here I go. Sei-yah!	
Message	Shido	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! The―!	
Message	None	"(After I regained consciousness, I taught them how
to massage non-violently, and our practice ended. I
seriously am glad the others weren't here for this...)"
