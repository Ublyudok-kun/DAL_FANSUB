Message	None	"(Today is the first day off I have had since
Yuzuru and I started officially dating. Of
course, we planned a date!)"	
Message	Shido	But... why are you here, Kaguya?	
Message	Kaguya	"Yuzuru told me to! She said she was running
late and wanted me to hang out with you.
I'm just doing her a favor. I'm not in the way."	
Message	Shido	"I never said you were, but I get it now.
You came here to keep me company, huh?
Thanks."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph. I am only here because Yuzuru asked
me. I'm not trying to win you back or anything."	
Message	Shido	Uh, I didn't say anything...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analysis. Kaguya enjoys your company, and
she cannot help from opening her big mouth."	
Message	Yuzuru	Arrival. Apologies for the wait, Shido.	
Message	Kaguya	What? Yuzu, you're blabbering...	
Message	Shido	I was waiting for you, Yuzuru. Let's get going.	
Message	Kaguya	Hey!	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, sorry. I was only kidding. Thanks for
hanging out with me, Kaguya. I was happy
to see you."	
Message	Kaguya	Mm... You're welcome.	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya, want to join us? I thought that's
what Yuzuru intended."	
Message	Yuzuru	Ignorance. The cloud formations are nice today.	
Message	Kaguya	"No, I won't join today. It's your date. Honestly,
I'd rather hang out with just you."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Kaguya	NNNNNNNOTHING! Enjoy your date!	
Message	Shido	Got it. If you approve, then we will.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. Kaguya, I can empathize.
Today, I will spend time with Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	"Kukuku... Hope you're happy. Heh, I'm
speaking out of character here. Buh-bye!"	
Message	Shido	Are you all right with her leaving?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. If we force Kaguya to join,
it would only irritate her. So today, allow
me to bask in your presence."	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me.	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru requested to go window shopping, so
we did. Browsing stores with her is always fun.)"	
Message	None	"(But going from hanging out as a trio into
a couple is an adjustment.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Observe. Please look, Shido. There are
several cute fish swimming about."	
Message	Shido	"Ah. This is a tropical fish shop. Oh. These
two kinda remind me of you and Kaguya."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. A ""Platinum Red Eye Albino Red
Tail"". It resembles our Astral Dresses…
This bratty one is Kaguya."	
Message	Shido	"I see what you mean. The other is acting
very prim, almost dignified."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. I would like you to take that back.
I do not behave in a prim or dignified manner."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. Got it. Request denied. I was only
giving my opinion on the tropical fish."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Growl. Hm... You are being rude today, Shido.
I can only envision what this means for our
future."	
Message	None	"(Seeing Yuzuru scowl made me smile. It wasn't
often that I got to see that side of her, so it
was a welcome and adorable surprise.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, sorry. Don't be upset.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. I am not upset. Only happy to
engage in small talk with you."	
Message	Shido	Me too, Yuzuru.	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru had a slight blush as she smiled.
If anyone had been watching, it might have
looked cheesy, but we're dating, so it's fine.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. Why don't we find some place
to rest? A cup of tea would do."	
Message	Shido	Oh, good idea. Resting would be great.	
Message	Shido	"I'm glad it isn't crowded. What do you
want to order, Yuzuru...?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Contemplation. Hm. I think this would
be nice."	
Message	Shido	This? This...? Seriously?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Smile. Of course. Let's order it. I would
enjoy sharing this with you."	
Message	Shido	"Well, Yuzuru, is there anything else you'd
want to get...?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. I ask this of you as your girlfriend.
You will oblige me, won't you?"	
Message	Shido	I see... Okay, fine.	
Message	None	"(We ordered the couple's juice. A large
schooner of juice with two crossed straws.
I guess it was a popular item here.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yuzuru... Are you regretting it?
You can stop me now."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Inquiry. What are you doing, Shido? You
must start drinking, or we won't finish."	
Message	None	"(I could hear hear people laughing around
me. I shouldn't let it bother me, but I can't
help it. I can run if I'm with Yuzuru...)"	
Message	Shido	L-Like this?	
Message	Yuzuru	Blush. This is embarrassing.	
Message	Shido	"Man, you're embarrassed too? Must be
revenge from earlier, huh?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Denial. No. I wanted to drink it with you,
Shido. That is true."	
Message	Shido	I give. Sorry. You'll have to forgive me.	
Message	None	"(Her smile is enough to make me concede.
I can't win.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Demand. Please drink it with me until there
is nothing left. Until then, I will not let you
go."	
Message	Shido	"Phew, there's so much. Everyone's watching
us..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreement. It is for two, but if we do it
together, Shido, I do not care who watches."	
Message	Shido	"Then, I'll make the most of it with you.
At least I get to see you blush."	
Message	None	"(It wasn't every day that I saw Yuzuru smile
so freely. Her joy was contagious.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Smile. Do as you please, Shido. Under one
condition..."	
Message	Shido	Condition? What's that?	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Shido, please be mine, forever and ever.
