Message	Shido	It's almost time to meet up.	
Message	None	"(Today, I'm at the station because I made plans to
go to a pool.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's been two years since I saw Yoshino last.
I hope she's doing fine."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's my younger cousin. One of the few
members of family I have, so our relatives are
very close at least, I think so.)"	
Message	None	"(I haven't seen her lately, so I didn't think
she'd call me Shido-oniichan anymore.)"	
Message	Shido	...But I sure was touched to hear from her.	
Message	Shido	"I'm going to meet her at the pool today. I wonder
what kind of girl Yoshino's become. Hehe..."	
Message	None	(I was giddy as I headed toward the facility.)	
Message	Shido	"Okay, I've changed into my swimsuit... I wonder if
I can spot Yoshino immediately. It's been a while
since I've seen her. I hope I can recognize her."	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, when we spoke on the phone,
she said she wanted to show me something... I
wonder what she wants to show me at a pool."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-oniichan!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, Shido-kuuun! This way!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, that voice!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-oniichan, over here.	
Message	Yoshinon	"How've you been, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, it's Yoshinon! Long time no see. Wait... then
that's Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	"It's been a while, Shido-oniichan!
...How have you been?"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. Been a while...	
Message	None	(Th-This is Yoshino? She's gotten big. Rather...)	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, you've changed.	
Message	Yoshino	Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. At least, I think so. You got really cute.	
Message	Yoshino	What?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whoa, Shido-kun. Coming on strong so early.\nWhat a player. Woo-hoo!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. It's been a while since we've seen each
other, I was just surprised."	
Message	Yoshino	Thank you, Shido-oniichan!	
Message	None	"(What do I do? I'm getting embarrassed for
complimenting her. Yoshinon has been smirking,
too. I gotta change the subject.)"	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, you said you wanted to show
me something. What did you want to show me?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, that's right. Yoshino, you have to tell him!\nShido-kun still doesn't seem to have noticed."	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, yes. You see, Shido-oniichan... Look at my
body carefully."	
Message	Shido	"That doesn't sound right... Hm, you seem pretty
tan. It's been so long since I've seen you, I
barely noticed at first."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, Shido-kun, you're horrible. You have to be\nmore observant."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Yoshinon. Uh... Yoshino, you seem like you
came back from a sunny vacation."	
Message	Yoshino	"This summer... I practiced swimming a lot. I
wanted you to see how much I've improved."	
Message	Shido	"So that's why you wanted to meet up at the pool,
huh? I see. That's great."	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah!	
Message	None	"(I noticed that her tan didn't match the swimsuit
she was wearing today. But... what was I thinking,
noticing that? She's a relative of mine.)"	
Message	Yoshino	What's the matter, Shido-oniichan...?	
Message	Shido	"N-Nothing. Anyways, you're wearing a swimsuit
today too, huh Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hehe. I'm glad you noticed, Shido-kun. That's\nright. Yoshinon is also in swimwear mode!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"What do you think, Shido-kun? Yoshinon in her\nswimsuit. Too sexy, or just right? Hehe. Ahaaaa."	
Message	Shido	Pfft. Hahaha. What the hell.	
Message	Yoshino	Hehe... *giggle*	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, rude much?!"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, sorry. Let's have fun today.	
Message	None	"(Okay, so I was able to play it off earlier thanks
to Yoshinon, but Yoshino's tan line is on my mind.
Maybe I can ask her.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshino...	
Choice		That new swimsuit looks good on you.	
Choice		You're not wearing your school swimsuit?	
Message	Shido	You look really good in that new swimsuit.	
Message	Yoshino	...! Th...ank you.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aren't you glad, Yoshino? You took so long\npicking out the perfect swimsuit!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon! That was a secret...!	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. You picked out a new swimsuit for today?
That's really nice."	
Message	Yoshino	But how did you know it was a new swimsuit?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, come to think of it, you're right. You're\nusually a lot more dense."	
Message	Shido	"Dense... I haven't seen you in a while, how can
you say that? ...Whatever. I could tell because
we were talking about suntans earlier."	
Message	Yoshino	Suntans?	
Message	Shido	"Your tan has the shape of another swimsuit. So,
seeing your tan lines, I figured the swimsuit
you're wearing now was bought recently."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, excellent deduction, Shido-kun! But\nShido-kun, ogling a girl's body like that is\nnot good form."	
Message	Shido	"Oh...?! Um... uh... well, I was just... thinking
it was a healthy-looking tan!"	
Message	Yoshino	Heh... Onii-chan, you're such a pervert!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, gross! Closet pervert!"	
Message	Shido	"Uhhh, so sorry. I wasn't looking at you in that
way, I swear!"	
Message	Yoshino	"I'm kidding. But... I'm glad. Do I look good in my
swimsuit?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you do.	
Message	Yoshino	I'm glad. Thank you, Onii-chan!	
Message	None	"(This makes me feel kind of... Well, seems like
Yoshino is happy, so I'll hold it in.)"	
Message	Shido	Anyways, let's enjoy the pool since we're here.	
Message	Yoshino	Okay!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Okay!"	
Message	None	(And we had fun together throughout the day.)	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, you're not going to wear your school
swimsuit today?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuun, what do you mean by that? I can't\nlet that one go."	
Message	None	(Oh crap. I don't think I phrased that one well.)	
Message	Yoshinon	"You want the adorable Yoshino to wear a school\nswimsuit, huh? You sure like that kind of stuff!\nPerv!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait a minute! I was just looking at Yoshino's
tan and figured she usually wore a different
swimsuit!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Really, now... But Shido-kun, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean she's wearing a school\nswimsuit, right?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't tell me that just by looking at her tan,\nyou can tell that it's a school swimsuit. Does\nthat mean you're a school swimsuit expert?!"	
Message	Shido	"N-No! I-I just made a guess! What's a school
swimsuit expert, anyways?!"	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-oniichan... You like school swimsuits...?	
Message	Shido	No, Yoshino. I'm not into school swimsuits...	
Message	Yoshino	"Then next time, I want to make sure you're\nhappy... I'll come in a school swimsuit, so just\nlook forward to it, okay?	
Message	Shido	...Huh? Oh, uh, thanks.	
Message	None	(Why am I saying thanks?! I need to deny it!)	
Message	Yoshinon	"So you do like school swimsuits! Shido-kun, you\nwere just being all embarrassed about it...\nHehehe."	
Message	Shido	N-No it's not like that! It just slipped out!	
Message	Yoshinon	"What? That's a lie. You're an honest guy,\nShido-kun. Right, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	Right, Yoshinon.	
Message	None	"(That day, Yoshino and Yoshinon found ways to
poke fun at me. Well, I guess the good thing was
that Yoshino looked like she was having fun."	
Message	Shido	"Ahhh, I sure swam a lot. I'm tired. That was fun,
Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes, it was extremely fun.	
Message	Shido	"I guess I'm going to have to take in as much of
your tan as I can for now."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes, we'll end here today...	
Message	None	(I meant it as a joke, but Yoshino smiled.)	
Message	Yoshino	I hope you look forward to next year... Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Well... next year, then.	
Message	Yoshino	"Okay. I'll be showing you the adult side of me,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	I look forward to it.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hehe. Shido-kun, you're head-over-heels for\nYoshino. It's so obvious you're blushing."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon!	
Message	Shido	...?! I-I guess I am, huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"See, you're playing it off like that. I guess\nI'll let it slide for today."	
Message	Shido	Okay. Thanks.	
Message	None	"(Jeez, Yoshinon's right. I was totally tossed
around just from seeing how mature Yoshino
had become.)"
