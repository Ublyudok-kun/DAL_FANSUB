Message	None	"(Some time has passed since Miku and I started
dating. Miku's been skillfully balancing her work
and school.)"	
Message	None	"(In fact, strangely enough, ever since we started
dating, she's only shined brighter. Sure, I might
be biased, but it's undeniable.)"	
Message	None	"(Even so, it's still a grueling schedule.
Thinking that she needed a well-deserved break,
Miku and I decided to have a park date.)"	
Message	Miku	"Darling, hurry hurry～
Over here～"	
Message	Shido	"You're so spry, even though it's been a while
since you've had a day off."	
Message	Miku	"Well, today's the day I can see you, after all.
All of my exhaustion just disappears."	
Message	None	"(As Miku says this, she takes my hand. Lately,
we've been less shy about holding hands, too.
We're finally progressing as a couple.)"	
Message	None	"(There was still so much we had to learn
about one another, but with time, we'd be
able to fill in the blanks bit by bit.)"	
Message	Miku	"What's the matter, darling? You're spacing
out again. Is something wrong? Or has
something good happened...?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well we've been dating for a while, right?
I was wondering if we were starting to act
like a couple. The thought crossed my mind."	
Message	Miku	"I want to know everything about you,
darling. I feel like I've gotten better as a
girlfriend. What do you think, darling?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You really have become such a great
girlfriend."	
Message	None	"(Of course, when we first started dating, she
didn't quite act like one yet.)"	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee. Glad to hear it. I want to continue
learning about who you are on the inside,
darling."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course.	
Message	None	"(As we walk, Miku frolics about happily. Seeing
Miku feel truly comfortable is a privilege she
only gives her boyfriend.)"	
Message	Shido	"Miku, what do you want to do today?
Is there somewhere you'd like to go?"	
Message	Miku	"Let me see. I'd like to go shopping, then have
ourselves a delicious meal, and afterwards, we'll
see a movie! I heard a new one just came out..."	
Message	Shido	"That's quite the schedule. It'll be well past
dark by the time we're through with it all."	
Message	Miku	"That's no problem at all. When the time comes,
I'll have you to escort me home, darling."	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. I guess that's true. We have to be
careful not to draw any attention."	
Message	Miku	"If such a scandal occurs, I'll proudly announce
that you're my darling."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. Is that really okay? If fans catch wind of
it, won't they be angry?"	
Message	Miku	"It's fine. In fact, you'll have to get used to
being in the media. ""So, Shido Itsuka, when were
you first attracted to popular idol, Miku Izayoi?"""	
Message	Shido	Wh-What? All of a sudden?	
Message	Miku	"It's a practice for being interviewed. You gotta
act cool and collected, or else it'll be a mess
whenever it eventually leaks."	
Message	Shido	"That's nice of you, but I don't think it's
something I'll need to practice."	
Message	Miku	"Not with that attitude. You have to clutch
the opportunity whenever it arises."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't want it to come to that, but you
said ""when"", and not ""if"". Hmm...."	
Message	Shido	"I love... the smile that you show to only me.
You have such a cute way of looking at the world
that I can't help myself. Is that... enough?"	
Message	Miku	....Goodness, darling!	
Message	Shido	"What? I'm being totally serious!
Why are you acting so surprised?"	
Message	Miku	You're being so honest, and it makes me happy.	
Message	Shido	"Haha, I see. Then, could you tell me what you
like about me?"	
Message	Miku	"How you're kind, and have a nice personality,
and how you're amazing, and how you're kind..."	
Message	Shido	"Did you just say ""kind"" twice?"	
Message	Miku	"I-It's fine! Either way,
I love all of you, darling!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, me too.
I love all of you, Miku."	
Message	Miku	Hee hee... Glad to hear it.	
Message	None	"(We shared this slightly embarrassing talk
as we headed towards the train station. First,
we shopped, then had lunch, and saw a movie.)"	
Message	None	"(Many fun things awaited us. From now
on as well.)"	
Message	Miku	Darling, don't let go of this hand, okay?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I have to hold on so you won't run away.	
Message	Miku	Yes. Never let go.
