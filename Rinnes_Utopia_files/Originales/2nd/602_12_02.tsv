Message	Shido	"*yawn*... School's almost out. Just a little
more to go."	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Origami	*pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami? What's the matter?	
Message	Origami	N-Nothing.	
Message	Shido	You look a little red. Are you getting sick?	
Message	Origami	I am fine. It is no big deal.	
Message	Shido	"Are you sure? Shouldn't you go to the nurse's
office?"	
Message	Origami	There is no problem. This is... a mere onset.	
Message	Shido	"Onset? I don't know what you're talking about,
but if that's the case, you should go to the
nurse's office."	
Message	Origami	"School's almost over... I can push through.
I will be fine."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, but don't overdo it, okay?	
Message	Origami	"I won't. I would rather be with you during
class."	
Message	Shido	"I see. But if you feel worse during class, then
be sure to let me know, okay?"	
Message	Origami	Got it...	
Message	Shido	"Man, she really does look like she's getting
sick."	
Message	Origami	The bell just rang. Class is starting.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	(Will she really be okay...?)	
Message	Origami	*pant*...*pant*... *sigh*...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey Origami! You sure you're okay?	
Message	Origami	I am close to my limit...	
Message	Shido	"C-Class just ended, so why don't I walk you
home? Can you stand?"	
Message	Origami	I can. *pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	(What's wrong with Origami...?)	
Message	Origami	*pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, do you want to rest somewhere?	
Message	Origami	I feel about ready to faint...	
Message	Shido	"Hey, are you okay? If you weren't feeling well,
you should've gone to the nurse."	
Message	Origami	No. The nurse... will not fix me.	
Message	Shido	What is going on? You look awful.	
Message	Origami	"I'm fine. The students... have almost all gone
home. At last, I can be rid of my onset."	
Message	Shido	"Well, yeah. We're far from school now, so
there aren't many students around. But how
is that supposed to help?"	
Message	Origami	Calm. I will require some of your gym clothes.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Gym clothes?	
Message	Origami	Correct. Lend me your gym clothes.	
Message	Shido	"What are you planning to do with my gym
clothes?"	
Message	None	"(Origami put her hand at the hem of her skirt
and fidgeted, rubbing her thighs together. She
only does that when she has an absurd request.)"	
Message	Origami	I need to sniff your scent.	
Message	Shido	*cough*...	
Message	Origami	What is the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Nothing. I thought I was prepared, but you
still threw me for a loop."	
Message	Origami	"I haven't had enough of your scent today.
When I searched through your locker during
my break, I couldn't find your gym clothes."	
Message	Shido	"You went through my locker?! What the hell
were you doing?!"	
Message	Origami	It is my daily routine now.	
Message	Shido	It is?!	
Message	Origami	Hence why I felt weak today.	
Message	Shido	Well, I took them home yesterday to wash.	
Message	Origami	"Then when you are finished washing them, I
need you to hand them over immediately.
Or else I cannot live."	
Message	Shido	Just what happened to you?!	
Message	Origami	"You have conditioned me through the nights
we have spent together."	
Message	Shido	I never did that!	
Message	Origami	"With that, it has been decided that I am going
over to your house."	
Message	Shido	"Agh... Well, I don't mind you visiting. You want
my gym clothes, right?"	
Message	Origami	So long as it has your scent, anything will do.	
Message	Shido	I-Is that how it works?	
Message	Origami	"Yes. So hurry, Shido. I am going through
withdrawals."	
Message	Shido	Withdrawals... Okay, okay. Fine.	
Message	Origami	Amazing, Shido. You are a fantastic boyfriend.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	(So, I took Origami to my house...)	
Message	None	"(After getting home, I immediately changed.
She said she didn't want me in my uniform on our
date. I asked Origami to leave my room, but...)"	
Message	Origami	...*inhale, exhale*...	
Message	None	"(I have no idea when she changed, but Origami
wore a new outfit as she entered my room and
began breathing deeply. When did she―)"	
Message	Shido	Origami, what are you doing?	
Message	Origami	"I have been deprived of Shido, so I am taking
deep breaths of his scent in his room."	
Message	Shido	...I-I don't get it.	
Message	None	(More accurately, I don't get her...)	
Message	Origami	"I feel a bit better now, but I still lack
sufficient quantities of your essence."	
Message	Shido	So it has to be my gym clothes?	
Message	None	(Origami did a subtle nod.)	
Message	Origami	I am most accustomed to your gym clothes.	
Message	Shido	Really...? This is taking it one step too far.	
Message	Origami	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"Um, never mind. I mean, are you seriously
going to sniff my gym clothes in front of me?"	
Message	Origami	"Well, in general, women who enjoy sniffing
gym clothes are extremely rare. So it would
be difficult to come up with an answer."	
Message	Shido	At least you're self-aware...	
Message	Origami	"But I am your girlfriend, Shido. I have the
right to sniff."	
Message	Shido	"I wouldn't call it a right, but I've already
washed and folded my gym clothes. I don't
think there's any scent..."	
Message	Origami	...Shido's hand soap!	
Message	Shido	I used the washing machine!	
Message	Origami	"But you touched them when you placed them
on the clothing line, and after you folded them."	
Message	Shido	Well, sure, but is that enough for you?	
Message	Origami	Fine. Wear them briefly right now.	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Origami	I want the freshly-worn scent.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...?	
Message	Origami	Hurry up and wear your gym clothes.	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	None	"(Well, whatever. There's no use in resisting.
The problem is I don't want to waste perfectly
clean gym clothes.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami. Does it have to be my gym clothes?	
Message	Origami	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	Uh, in other words...	
Choice		Smell the clothes I'm wearing.	
Choice		Never mind.	
Message	Shido	"Why can't you smell the clothes I'm wearing
right now? We're alone in my room. You can
even bury your face in my chest."	
Message	Origami	"I never thought such an offer would come from
you."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Well, I'm still adjusting too. By now,
I've practically given up..."	
Message	Shido	If it'll make you feel better, then go for it.	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Origami	That is more than I could ever wish for, but...	
Message	Shido	Is something wrong?	
Message	Origami	It's so sudden. I am confused.	
Message	None	"(From demanding to sniff my gym clothes
to being shocked by my offer...)"	
Message	Shido	"This isn't too out of the ordinary, right?
We're, um, dating after all."	
Message	None	"(I'm shy about it, but it's true. We're an
official couple. We should be able to hug
one another.)"	
Message	Origami	Then I won't hold back.	
Message	Shido	Sure. Go for it.	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	How's this, Origami?	
Message	Origami	...Very good.	
Message	Origami	"It's as if I am wrapped in your tender embrace.
So warm."	
Message	None	"(Origami's slender body leaned into mine.
She is as smooth as a silk cloth.)"	
Message	Shido	Your hair... is very soft. It smells nice.	
Message	Origami	"Shido, your chest... is so inviting. I want to
stay this way forever."	
Message	None	"(Origami sank into my chest. It was a feeling
I could get lost in.)"	
Message	None	"(But Origami's body was small and delicate.
As though, if I held her too tightly, she would
break.)"	
Message	None	"(I moved my arms slightly, wrapping them
tenderly around Origami's shoulders.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	None	"(We called each other by name. For some
reason, despite being so close, we still
longed to be even closer. Yearned, even.)"	
Message	Origami	I wish to keep going like this for a while.	
Message	Shido	We can. I'm happy to.	
Message	None	"(I squeezed her shoulders, pulling Origami
closer into my embrace. There was no space
between us. That is how it felt.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, I feel a little pain.	
Message	Shido	I am sorry. Did I hug you too tightly?	
Message	Origami	Mm... It is fine. I want to stay like this...	
Message	Shido	Ah...	
Message	None	"(We held each other, letting time pass
around us.)"	
Message	Shido	"Why don't we stop this, Origami? I mean,
it's a lot to ask me to wear my gym clothes
here."	
Message	Origami	"I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to
propose a new idea."	
Message	Shido	"Okay. That didn't take much convincing.
What's the new idea?"	
Message	Origami	I'll sniff you directly.	
Message	Shido	What?! Wait, you mea...	
Message	Origami	I'm doing it.	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Hey, Origami?!	
Message	None	"(Origami got right up next to me. Her soft
face was pressed against my chest.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami...	
Message	Origami	Ah, this is so comforting. I can feel you Shido.	
Message	Shido	Wait. I'm not comfortable at all!	
Message	None	"(Surprise. Panic. Embarrassment. Excitement.
So many emotions tumbled in my chest.)"	
Message	None	"(It was like my heartbeat could reach Origami.
I tried to make some space between us, so I
grabbed her shoulder, but―)"	
Message	None	"(My entire body was enveloped by warmth,
which seeped slowly into my skin.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, your body... It's so warm.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... I feel it too.	
Message	None	"(Through my thin shirt, our respective body
heats combined.)"	
Message	None	"(It melted away my nerves. Serenity came
over me.)"	
Message	None	"(I wanted nothing more than to be taken by
this serenity, so I drew Origami in closer.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami, how's this? Satisfied?	
Message	Origami	Just a bit longer... I want to stay like this.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Not yet.	
Message	Origami	I want to stay like this forever.	
Message	Shido	"Well, that I can't do, but a little more
couldn't hurt. Honestly, I like it too."	
Message	None	"(We stood in this position for a few more
minutes.)"	
Message	None	"(Light from the amber sunset peeked in
through my blinds, illuminating our tender
feelings. What a nice moment.)"	
Message	None	(Even I wished it could last forever.)	
Message	None	"(It was difficult to articulate how I felt to her,
but somehow the moment compelled me.)"	
Message	None	(That... I love her.)	
Message	Shido	...Origami.	
Message	None	(I spoke her name, then...)	
Message	Origami	*breathe*...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Origami...?	
Message	Origami	*inhale, exhale*...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?!	
Message	Origami	It is almost time for me to take in your breath.	
Message	Shido	"Since when was that a thing?! Don't breathe
my second-hand air! I-It's gross..."	
Message	Origami	*exhale*...	
Message	Shido	"Whoa. That's so weird. Don't breathe it onto
me!"	
Message	Origami	*inhale*...	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Cold!	
Message	Origami	*exhale*...	
Message	Shido	WARM!	
Message	Origami	*inhale*...	
Message	Shido	STOOOOOOOP!	
Message	Origami	Satisfied. I got my fix.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, geez...	
Message	Origami	And now, I will survive for today.	
Message	Shido	"Don't make it seem like you would've died
if this didn't happen."	
Message	Origami	"Perhaps it was not that severe, but I need
my daily dose of Shido to restore my health."	
Message	Shido	Get your Vitamin D somewhere else...	
Message	Origami	Finally, I can be my usual self.	
Message	Shido	Jeez...	
Message	None	(Man, right as I was feeling romantic...)	
Message	None	(Oh, well.)	
Message	None	"(Origami seemed satisfied. As long as she
was happy, I was happy.)"	
Message	Shido	"Let's end it here for today. I'm sure Kotori
will be home any time now."	
Message	Origami	Thank you, Shido. You saved me.	
Message	Shido	"S-Sure. Next time you're in trouble, let me
know, okay?"	
Message	Origami	Can I look forward to the next time?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well, I guess... How's this: from now on,
instead of sniffing my gym clothes behind
my back, just ask me first?"	
Message	Shido	I-I can at least... be with you.	
Message	Origami	Then, I will do so.	
Message	Shido	"Okay. Remember, I'm your boyfriend.
As such, I'll do whatever I can for you."	
Message	Origami	That makes me happy.	
Message	None	(Unh... I'm so embarrassed.)	
Message	None	"(Since then, Origami had stopped going through
my locker to sniff my gym clothes.)"	
Message	None	(The following day...)	
Message	Shido	All right. Time to go home. Hm...?	
Message	None	(There's a bag on my desk. What is this?)	
Message	Shido	Whoa. There are gym clothes inside!	
Message	None	"(It was a set of neatly-folded gym clothes.
On them, I saw the name tag: Tobiichi.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami's clothes. Wait, don't tell me...	
Message	None	"(I searched through the bag and found a
letter. Inside, the message read,
"Returning the favor.")"	
Message	None	"(Returning the favor by giving me gym clothes?
Wait, don't tell me...)"	
Message	Shido	"We had gym today. Wait, are these the clothes
she wore earlier...?"	
Message	Shido	"What does she expect me to do with these?
Wait, is she telling me to sniff them...?"	
Choice		Sniff them.	
Choice		Return the bag to Origami's desk.	
Choice		What the hell, wear 'em.	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, Reine-san asked me if I was
sniffing Origami's gym clothes. I wonder if
Origami believed I did."	
Message	None	(Of course. I never did such a thing.)	
Message	Shido	"Is that what Origami wants me to do...?
Does she want me to cross this boundary?"	
Message	None	"(I reached nervously into the bag, and found
a small shirt.)"	
Message	None	"(She was wearing this shirt only a few hours
ago.)"	
Message	None	(I unfolded it and stared at it.)	
Message	Shido	This really is a petite size.	
Message	None	"(Her shoulder length was so much smaller
than mine.)"	
Message	None	(Thinking that, I hugged the gym clothes.)	
Message	None	"(All that's left for me is to put my nose to
it.)"	
Message	None	"(Am I really doing this? Origami's scent.
I wonder what it smells like.)"	
Message	None	"(I imagined Origami wearing this, and
became excited all of a sudden!)"	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...	
Message	None	(Here I go, Origami... I'm going in!)	
Message	Ai	Itsuka-kun, what are you doing?	
Message	Mai	Are those Tobiichi-san's gym clothes...?	
Message	Mii	Wow. What a creep.	
Message	Shido	FUAAAAHH! When did you guys get here?!	
Message	None	"(The perverted tale of Shido Itsuka was spread
all around school. The next day, everyone gave
me cold stares. It made class a living hell...)"	
Message	None	"(If Origami hadn't told everyone that she
asked me to sew her name tag, I never
would have lived it down.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami... She's got the wrong idea.	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, Reine-san told Origami
once that I was sniffing her gym clothes...
Does she still think that happened?)"	
Message	None	(I'm not that kind of guy.)	
Message	Shido	I'm going to place this back on Origami's desk.	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Whoa, Origami?! Where did you come from?!	
Message	Origami	"As usual. From the entrance. I wanted to
observe what you would do with my gym
clothes, so I came to watch."	
Message	Shido	"Close call! If I had gone through with it,
you would've seen it all!"	
Message	Origami	Shido, won't you sniff my gym clothes?	
Message	Shido	I-I appreciate the gesture.	
Message	Origami	I see. Got it.	
Message	None	"(Origami nodded and agreed, to my surprise.
But my internal alarm was going off.)"	
Message	Shido	Just so I'm clear, what is it you "got"?	
Message	Origami	"Shido, you will no longer be satisfied with
my gym clothes alone."	
Message	Shido	"NO! I knew it! You're totally missing my point!
It's fine, Origami. You don't have to reach
into your shirt. What are you trying to do?!"	
Message	Origami	If you want to go beyond gym clothes...	
Message	Shido	"GET YOUR MIND AWAY FROM SNIFFING!
Seriously. I don't need you to show me
your appreciation!"	
Message	Origami	No. I must insist.	
Message	Shido	"No, seriously. I'm fine. I'm just happy to be
with you, Origami."	
Message	Origami	Shido. What did you say...	
Message	Shido	"L-Like I said, um, I'm just happy that you're
my girlfriend. I don't need anything."	
Message	Origami	"Got it. I want nothing more than to be with
you, Shido. Having you as a partner makes
me happier more than anything."	
Message	Shido	Right. Let's go home, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Okay...	
Message	None	(And so, we went home together.)	
Message	Origami	"Shido, could I go over to your house today
as well? I want... to sniff you."	
Message	Shido	Really? It never ends with you...	
Message	None	"(No one else is around. Okay. Instead of
sniffing them, why don't I wear them?)"	
Message	Shido	"If I put them on, Origami would probably be
impressed by the novelty of it."	
Message	None	(First, I need to take my clothes off.)	
Message	None	(Okay, now to try her clothes...)	
Message	None	"(Man, they're soft. They're ordinary girl's
clothes, but it's like girls use nicer fabric
softener or something.)"	
Message	None	(Okay, here goes...)	
Message	Shido	Urgh... It's tight. Well, she is petite.	
Message	None	(I think I could still wear it though.)	
Message	Shido	Agh... It fit. Nice.	
Message	None	"(My chest was bulging out of this girl's
shirt. How impure of me. Almost like the
shirt could rip at any moment.)"	
Message	Shido	This is a whole new world...	
Message	Shido	"Whew. This is sort of nice. Okay, now to
try on the shorts..."	
Message	None	"(I've come this far. Might as well see it
through. I looked at the blue polyester
bottoms...)"	
Message	None	(Then...)	
Message	Tamae	"Itsuka-kun! What are you doing...?
"	
Message	Tamae	"Don't those...
belong to Tobiichi-san?"	
Message	Shido	*gasp*! Sensei! When did you get here?!	
Message	Tamae	"...Itsuka-kun. I-I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to watch."	
Message	Shido	No. Tama-chan-sensei!	
Message	None	"(This is terrible. I need to chase after her
and explain myself...)"	
Message	Shido	Wait, sensei! You have the wrong idea...	
Message	Tamae	"AAAAH! Don't run after me, Itsuka! Not in
those clothes!"	
Message	Shido	Crap! That's right! I'm half naked right now!	
Message	None	"(I was wearing Origami's shirt, but I hadn't
put on the shorts yet. I just had boxers and
socks. And now I'm in the hallway...)"	
Message	Tamae	"I'm sorry, Itsuka-kun! I can't deal with
thaaaaat! I'm sorry! As a teacher, please
understaaaaaand!"	
Message	None	(Uh. I understand...)	
Message	None	(Man, this is a nightmare.)	
Message	None	"(The next day, Tama-chan looked at me with
fear in her eye. Or was it pity? Either way, it
went on for a while...)"	
Message	None	"(Talk about the most awkward interaction of
my life...)"
