Message	Shido	"Kaguya and Yuzuru need to talk with me.
I wonder what it's about."	
Message	None	"(I ran up to the rooftop. The twins wrote me a
message saying we needed to discuss something
in person, and to meet them on the roof.)"	
Message	Shido	I have a feeling... I know what this will be about.	
Message	Kaguya	I've been waiting for you, Shido.	
Message	Yuzuru	Awaiting. Thank you for coming, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Sorry if I kept you. So, let's talk.	
Message	None	"(The two looked at one another in contemplation.
A silence floated between us, but Kaguya took a
step forward.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"I really came to terms with my feelings during
our last date. Shido, spending time as the three
of us has been fun, but..."	
Message	Kaguya	"I realize just how much I really like you.
I was hoping maybe you felt the same way.
In the end, I hoped you would choose me."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Monopoly. When Kaguya had informed me,
I was surprised, but I agree with her sentiment.
I want you as a boyfriend for myself."	
Message	None	"(The two looked at one another in contemplation.
A silence floated between us, but Yuzuru took a
step forward.)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Flashback. Our most recent date was rather
wonderful. Spending time alone with you, Shido,
satisfied me greatly."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Confession. I love you, Shido. I relish the
thought of being in your company. Choose me."	
Message	Kaguya	"I feel the same way. It was fun to run around
as a trio, but I want even more time with you,
Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	This has to change.	
Message	None	"(I felt as though we had run into this problem
before, but this time, there were serious
feelings to consider on all sides.)"	
Message	None	"(Both of them looked dead serious. I'm sure
Kaguya and Yuzuru have thought long and
hard about it. More than I could imagine.)"	
Message	None	"(Because they posed the questions, I need
to return an answer. No half-assed responses.
They wouldn't accept anything less.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I haven't been a good boyfriend, have I?
I wasn't enough to satisfy you both."	
Message	Kaguya	That's not it! We're just being selfish!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. No matter what, I wish that you would
choose, Shido. Choose one of us."	
Message	Shido	Y-You guys...?! H-Hey!	
Message	Kaguya	"Now answer me, Shido. Who among us gets
your heart beating fastest?! She will be the
one most deserving of your love."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. It has to be whomever you have
made a more intimate connection with."	
Message	None	"(They blushed, pressing my hands against
their chests. I could feel each twin's heart
beat.)"	
Message	None	"(No... It was my heartbeat. This is all so
sudden. What's going on here...?)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Suggestion. Instead of the faster heartbeat,
you can choose whomever has a bigger chest."	
Message	Kaguya	"HEY! It's obvious you'd win that category,
Yuzuru! Shido, small ones aren't too bad.
Plus there's always the chance it'll grow!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. Choosing a larger pair now
guarantees pleasure for the future. It
would be disappointing if hers never grew."	
Message	Kaguya	"They're not that small! Besides, once you fall
in love, chest size doesn't even matter! Right,
Shido?!"	
Message	Shido	"Well, Kaguya, yours is plenty... Wait.
What am I even saying? Ladies, hold on
a minute. I don't know what's going on."	
Message	Kaguya	"...I'll never let you go. Until you choose, I'll
hang on forever, Shido."	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Shido, please tell us whom you prefer.	
Message	Shido	Okay, I'll give it some thought...	
Message	None	"(I took deep breaths, getting over the sense
of unease. I listened to each girls' heartbeat.
Soon, I felt calm, and I picked...)"	
Message	Shido	...I think Kaguya's is beating quicker.	
Message	Kaguya	Shido, does that mean...?	
Message	Shido	Kaguya, I officially choose you as my girlfriend.	
Message	Kaguya	"O-Okay! Hehe. Cheers. You've really made
my day."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Blessing. Congratulations, Kaguya. Shido,
do take care of Kaguya, please."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I promise. Yuzuru, I...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Halt. You needn't offer me any apologies.
I have our memories to cherish for now.
There is nothing to forgive. You too, Kaguya."	
Message	Kaguya	"Rgh...
"	
Message	Kaguya	"Got it. I will love Shido enough for two of us,
Yuzuru."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Observation. I believe you sufficiently care
for Kaguya. I want whatever you want. If
you love her, I will accept it."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Return. You are welcome. Hehe. What is the
matter, Kaguya? I thought you intended to
ask Shido something."	
Message	Kaguya	Huh? Oh, um...	
Message	Shido	I'm all ears. But just for today.	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, okay. Um, Shido... I want to go on a date
with just the two of us. This time, I want it to
be extremely romantic."	
Message	Shido	Romantic, huh...? Kaguya?	
Message	Kaguya	Wh-What, got a problem with that?!	
Message	Yuzuru	Snicker. Romantic does not suit you, Kaguya.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Yuzuru's right. This isn't like you.	
Message	Kaguya	Who cares?! Jeez, you two are a pain in the ass!	
Message	None	"(And so, Kaguya and I started dating. I can't
wait to see what's in store for my one and
only girlfriend.)"	
Message	None	"(That doesn't mean we won't see Yuzuru
anymore. All because Yuzuru holds a special
place in my and Kaguya's hearts.)"	
Message	None	"(There are times when our relationship will
come first, but we'll always find time for the
trio. The three of us will always be close.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm so spoiled...	
Message	None	"(Yuzuru sent Kaguya and me off as we left
with our hands held together.)"	
Message	Shido	I think Yuzuru's heartbeat is louder.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Verify. Shido, really? Are you sure you choose
me?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, Yuzuru. I want you. Will you go out with
me?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. I have already stated how I feel.
This makes me very happy, Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	"Congrats, Yuzuru. Shido might be incompetent,
but it was enough to win you over."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Objection. Kaguya, you needn't play off your
disappointment. I know you care for Shido as
much as I do. Are you holding back, Kaguya?"	
Message	Kaguya	"It's okay! We talked about this all yesterday!
I'm happy Shido chose you, Yuzuru...
"	
Message	Kaguya	Well, of course I'm a little disappointed...	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Kaguya...	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh. No need to apologize! I mean it!
Wah, Yuzuru. Shido is so mean."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Concern. There, there. Shido has his cruel
moments. As his girlfriend, I will reprimand
him later."	
Message	Kaguya	Rgh. Shido. Yuzuru is being mean!	
Message	Shido	Okay. Then, as her boyfriend, I'll―	
Message	Kaguya	"Forget it! Jeez, you guys. You're practically
perfect for each other. It's annoying!"	
Message	Shido	"Seriously. Thank you so much, Kaguya.
Thanks for your blessing."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe. If you let me hang out with you
from time to time, I'll let it slide."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Of course. Kaguya, I consider you
a precious, precious person to me."	
Message	Shido	Agreed.	
Message	Kaguya	"*hiccup*... You don't have to try to cheer me
up! I mean, you're dating now. Don't you have
something to ask Shido, Yuzuru?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. Correct. Well, Shido. As your partner,
this is the first question I shall pose to you.
Will you take me on a date?"	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Kaguya	Now, now. Hurry up, or the day will be over!	
Message	Shido	Yeah. See you tomorrow, Kaguya.	
Message	Yuzuru	Flattery. See you tomorrow, Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	"Yeah, I'll see you tomo―Hey, wait
Yuzuru."	
Message	Kaguya	" Don't you plan to come home?!
NO! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!"	
Message	Shido	Hahaha... Haha...	
Message	Yuzuru	Laugh. Hehehe...	
Message	None	"(With the hand of the one I love in mine,
I pondered where the day would take us.)"	
Message	None	"(From then on, Yuzuru and I became a couple.
I looked forward to spending time with my
one and only girlfriend.)"	
Message	None	"(That doesn't mean we won't see Kaguya
anymore. All because Kaguya holds a special
place in my and Yuzuru's hearts.)"	
Message	None	"(There are times when our relationship will
come first, but we'll always find time for the
trio. The three of us will always be close.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm so spoiled...	
Message	None	"(As Kaguya screamed in objection, Yuzuru and I
left hand in hand!)"
