Message	None	"(Ever since then, we stopped using the words, ""because
we're dating"".)"	
Message	None	"(Just because two people are going out doesn't mean
you have to do anything. That's obvious. But it's also
not a reason to do nothing.)"	
Message	None	"(If we want to do something, we'll do it. If not, we
won't. We just won't force it. And we won't be tied
down to any labels.)"	
Message	None	"(We talked about it. And as we'd suggested, we were
spending the days slowly and calmly.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun, you sure are patient.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	None	"(Yoshino had visited me after school again today. Of
course Yoshinon would be with us.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Because you're a young boy, Shido-kun. Aren't\nthere a bunch of things you wanted to do once you\ngot a girlfriend?	
Message	Yoshino	You can do whatever you want...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Seeeee. She said you can do whatever you wannnnt.\nYou sly dog, you.	
Message	Shido	"It's true that I imagined wanting to do a lot of
things once I had a girlfriend."	
Message	Shido	But it doesn't have to be right now.	
Message	Yoshino	Why not...?	
Message	Yoshinon	That doesn't mean that you don't care about Yoshino,\nright?	
Message	Shido	"Of course. I told you already, it doesn't have to be
now. It can be eventually."	
Message	Yoshino	Eventually, huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, eventually is eventually. Yoshino, you'll always
be with me, so I'm sure such time will come. I'm fine
with waiting until then."	
Message	Yoshinon	Gosh, that sure does sound like a long time. Well, I\nguess Yoshino says she doesn't mind.	
Message	Yoshinon	But if you can't take it anymore, or if you can't\nhold yourself back, Shido-kun... I think you can do\nwhatever you want.	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes. I'm ready... emotionally.	
Message	Shido	...I want to think that I wouldn't lose control.	
Message	None	"(To have her say this much... I don't know what to
do.)"	
Message	Shido	"So what do you want to do today? You want to read
books like the other day?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hahaha. A joint activity to feel each other's love～	
Message	None	"(Yoshino isn't good at flipping the pages because
Yoshinon's there.)"	
Message	None	"(So I always flip the page for Yoshino so that she can
see while leaning on me.)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... Today... Um... I brought something.	
Message	None	(Yoshino brought something big today.)	
Message	Shido	What did you bring today?	
Message	Yoshinon	Hehehe. What do you think it is? It's light for its\nsize. It's soft and feels really good! What is it?!	
Message	Shido	Huh...? I have no idea...	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... It's this.	
Message	Shido	Plushies...?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... It took some time, but... I made them.	
Message	Shido	Wow. They're all really good.	
Message	None	"(All the plushies that Yoshino took out seemed to
be made with care.)"	
Message	Shido	Hm...? This plushie... I feel like I've seen it before.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... This is you... Shido-san... And this... is me.	
Message	Yoshinon	Ahhh. She made you pretty handsome. Then it can stand\nnext to Yoshinon.	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, right. I think it's really well-made. Yoshino,
you're good at making these, aren't you?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yes... Well, I don't know... if I'm good at it,
but... I like making these kinds of things..."	
Message	Shido	"It looks like something you'd buy from a store... No,
even better."	
Message	None	"(I took the plushie that looked like me and examined
it. It really was well put together.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. But knowing you made and kept a plushie that
looks like me makes me blush a bit."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I'm sorry... For making it without asking
permission..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I'm not mad. It doesn't upset me. It's just... You
know, I feel self-conscious about it."	
Message	Yoshinon	Right? Whenever she couldn't see you, Shido-kun,\nshe'd look at it and hug it to hide the sorrow...\nCan you imagine it? Can you imagine her doing it?	
Message	Shido	"Shut up! If you do that, you'll make me think about
it."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry... Um.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, well like I said, I don't mind. It's nothing you
need to worry about, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	...Thank you.	
Message	Shido	"If you feel lonely, Yoshino, I would like to be by
your side."	
Message	Yoshino	I'm okay. I know that it's me acting spoiled...	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun. We know you have your own life, too.\nOf course Yoshino doesn't want to get in your way.	
Message	Shido	"You say that, but Yoshino, you can afford to be more
spoiled if you wanted."	
Message	Yoshino	"Th-Then... Um, is it okay if I continue to... take
good care of your plushie?"	
Message	Shido	I would never say no.	
Message	Yoshinon	Aren't you glad, Yoshino? I mean, all this time,\nyou've sat it at the dinner table, slept with it, and\neven bathed with it.	
Message	Shido	...You can get it wet?	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... I have to hand wash it, but... Are you sure I
can keep it?""	
Message	Yoshinon	""Why not? Shido-kun said you can. Why don't you\nleave the plushie of you with Shido-kun, then?"	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. That might be a good idea.	
Message	Yoshinon	Totally. I'm sure if Shido-kun goes to sleep with it,\nhe can feel you always by his side.	
Message	Shido	"...It's nice that I'll be with Yoshino, but I kind of
feel embarrassed sleeping with a plushie at this age."	
Message	Yoshino	...Oh, but I think it's cute.	
Message	None	"(It's nice that Yoshino's happy, but I honestly can't
be happy being called ""cute"" at this age.)"	
Message	None	"(And before I knew it, Yoshino picked up the plushie
that looked like herself and held it out toward me.)"	
Message	Shido	Seeing you like that is interesting.	
Message	Yoshino	Interesting?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Seeing the plushie Yoshino and Yoshinon next
to one another... It kinda feels like they're friends."	
Message	Yoshinon	Then I guess Shido-kun is also part of the club?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh... Yeah, I guess that would make me part of
it."	
Message	None	(I tried moving the plushie that I had in hand.)	
Message	None	"(Yoshino matched my moves and moved her plushie
along with mine.)"	
Message	Yoshino	...Hello, Shido...san.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Hello.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino made the plushie bow, and I did so too, but
I couldn't help but bow with it.)"	
Message	Yoshino	"Hehe... This really is... interesting. Shido-san,
you're playing with the plushie I made... It's kinda...
cute."	
Message	Shido	"...I think the plushie would be happier to be called
""cute"" rather than me."	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino is taking good care of it on the daily, so I'm\nsure it's sick of being called cute.	
Message	Shido	...Are you always with it?	
Message	Yoshino	"N-No, that's not true... I-I just... keep it near me
and sleep with it whenever I can't see you, if I'm
feeling lonely."	
Message	None	"(As she said that, Yoshino made the plushie take
action as if to say, ""You caught me"".)"	
Message	Shido	I see. So you're sleeping with Yoshino, huh...	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun. If you're jealous, you can say so.	
Message	Shido	It's true. I am kind of jealous.	
Message	Yoshinon	You hear that, Yoshino? Shido said he wants to sleep\nwith you in his arms!	
Message	Yoshino	"...Then... is it okay if I... spend the night sometime
soon?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah sure.	
Message	None	"(Having an embarrassing conversation like this through
the plushie somehow makes it bearable.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	But aren't you lucky that you get to sleep using\nYoshino as a body pillow? It's a rare thing, being able\nto do that.	
Message	Shido	Yeah―	
Message	Yoshinon	―And besides, if you sleep like that, who knows?\nYour hand may accidentally touch things, right?	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... I may not have the best sleeping posture,
so... If that happens, I'm sorry..."	
Message	Shido	Don't worry. It's hard to wake me.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, really...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Because I don't wake up easily, Kotori will
dance on top of me."	
Message	Yoshinon	Hmmm. So to put it frankly, once you fall asleep, if\nwe don't step on you, you won't wake up?	
Message	Shido	"Wait. That was just an example. I do wake up at times
too, you know."	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Then I'll try my best...!	
Message	None	"(What is she going to try her best at...? Besides, if
Yoshino spends the night and I'm able to hold her...
Would I be able to fall asleep normally?)"	
Message	None	"(Honestly, if such thing happens, I feel like I'll be
so nervous that I won't be able to sleep at all.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun, I can read you like a book. Why are you\ngetting so nervous now?	
Message	Shido	"Well, we're talking about Yoshino coming over to spend
the night. Of course I'd get nervous."	
Message	Shido	"But even then, even if Yoshino did come sleep over,
I'm sure she'd be sleeping in the guest room."	
Message	Yoshino	...Um, I won't be able to sleep next to you?	
Message	Shido	"Well, Kotori's in the house, so I don't think she'd
let that happen."	
Message	Yoshinon	At the end of the day, you're always listening to\nKotori-chan, aren't you?	
Message	Shido	"Contrary to her attitude sometimes, she's still my
little sister."	
Message	Yoshino	"...I'm envious... that she can always be with you. If
only... I were your little sister too..."	
Message	Shido	But I wouldn't like that.	
Message	Yoshinon	Hmmm? What do you mean by that, Shido-kun?\nYou're saying that you don't want to be with Yoshino\nand Yoshinon?! That's messed up! So mean!	
Message	Shido	"That's not what I mean. If Yoshino's my little sister,
then I can't have her as my girlfriend right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...?! That's right...!	
Message	Shido	"Yup. And besides, we may not be together now, but
I'll try my best so that we can be together someday."	
Message	Yoshinon	But currently, you're going to look out for your\nlittle sister and won't use Yoshino as your body\npillow, right?	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon...	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san... You're so nice to... everyone, aren't
you?"	
Message	Shido	You think so?	
Message	Yoshinon	Yeahhhh. I mean, that's what's great about you and\nall, but if you're too nice, Yoshino gets worried.\nDon't you understand a girl's heart?	
Message	Shido	...Did I worry you?	
Message	Yoshino	"Um... It's not your fault, Shido-san. It's just that I
just get worried sometimes..."	
Message	Yoshino	"But really, it's just me. It's nice to be kind.. It's
not okay... for me to worry about that..."	
Message	Yoshino	"Although I trust... that you would never betray me...
There are times where I want you all to myself...
I'm sorry..."	
Message	Shido	"It's nothing to apologize for. I'll be more careful,
too."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino is a good girl, and is always looking out for
me. That's why I'm sort of relieved that something
like this worries her.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's just that it's hard for me to suddenly stop being
like that."	
Message	Yoshino	"No... Please, don't stop... If you suddenly become
mean to others... that'll make me even more sad.
So―"	
Message	Yoshinon	So in the end, Yoshino is just being spoiled, huh?\nTypical guy. You have to take responsibility now.	
Message	Shido	Of course I'll take responsibility.	
Message	Yoshino	...?!	
Message	Yoshinon	Whoa... Shido-kun, you can be so bold!	
Message	None	"(So they say, but I was able to say that because I was
using the plushie to talk.)"	
Message	None	"(If it were me, then I'd be so embarrassed. I wouldn't
be able to say something like that.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san... Um...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Yoshino... What's―	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Yoshino	...I love you.	
Message	Shido	...Me, too.	
Message	Yoshino	...Please continue to be with me.	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	None	(And so...)	
Message	None	(Not just the plushie but... we too got closer.)	
Message	None	"(Let's continue... to be together. With this feeling
in our hearts.)"
