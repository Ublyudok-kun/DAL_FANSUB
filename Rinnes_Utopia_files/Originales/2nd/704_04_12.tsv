Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kusakabe	Oh.	
Message	Kusakabe	Hello, Itsuka-kun. Fancy meeting you here.	
Message	Shido	Nice to see you.	
Message	Kusakabe	Taking a walk?	
Message	Shido	Um. Something like that.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Do you really have free time right now? Don't
you have homework to do?"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha... Well, I'm on top of it. What about
you, Kusakabe-san?"	
Message	Kusakabe	Taking a walk. I'm on my break.	
Message	Shido	We're the same.	
Message	Kusakabe	That's right. Everyone needs a breather.	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kusakabe	"That's right. Do you ever find there are
things you can't talk about, or that you
find unreasonable?"	
Message	Kusakabe	"It's often that I find myself attacked by
feelings of helplessness. In times like these,
it's necessary to take a break."	
Message	Shido	...I see.	
Message	Kusakabe	Ahh. That's a depressing topic. Sorry.	
Message	Shido	No, it's all right...	
Message	Kusakabe	It's nothing serious, so don't worry.	
Message	Shido	"Er, well... I hope everything turns out okay.
Sorry. I wish I had more to offer you."	
Message	Kusakabe	No, thank you. You're right. I'll do my best.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Be the best student you can be, Itsuka-kun.
Look out for Origami too. See you later."
