Message	Shido	"So, what would you like to do today? You
have the floor, so I'm all ears, Maria."	
Message	Maria	"...? What do you mean, Shido? Do we not have
school?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh, that's right.
So you see, Maria, today we're off from
school. It's a holiday, after all."	
Message	Maria	"I see. I am aware there is no school on holidays,
but I had forgotten. I apologize."	
Message	Shido	"No, you don't have to apologize. Did you
actually want to go to school?"	
Message	Maria	"Well, yes. There are many things that I have
yet to lose interest in."	
Message	Shido	"If that's the case, then don't worry, Maria.
When the holiday ends, we'll go back to
school. Today's a break to do whatever you want."	
Message	Maria	Anything I want?	
Message	Shido	"That's right. For example, you could spend all
day learning how to cook, or play games...
So Maria, got anything in mind?"	
Message	Maria	Then, I wish to go on a date with you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. We can do that too, but...
Is there anything else?"	
Message	Maria	"Anything else. Let me think. Then, I would like
to spend time with Tohka Yatogami and the others.
Young women of an age should bond together."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that sounds good. I'd be happy to help
with you getting closer to Tohka and the others."	
Message	Maria	I see. Then let us proceed...	
Message	Maria	" On second thought, if I do so, then I would no
longer be able to date Shido. So which should
I choose... Friendship or Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"When you put it like that, it feels like I'm
being put on a scale."	
Message	Kotori	"Isn't it simple? If you choose both, then
everyone wins."	
Message	Maria	Both?	
Message	Kotori	"Pick Shido and the others. If you go shopping
as a group, then you can bond with everyone."	
Message	Maria	"A splendid idea. Truly wonderful. Would you
mind that, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"If you're fine with it, Maria, then it's fine
with me."	
Message	Kotori	"Then it's decided. All right. I shall contact
everyone for you on your behalf."	
Message	Maria	Really? Thank you, Kotori Itsuka.	
Message	Kotori	"Leave it all to me. That's how things should
be. Shido, I'll leave the rest to you."	
Message	Shido	I don't mind, but aren't you coming, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"I'll sit out today. There's something I want to
investigate."	
Message	Shido	"Well, if you say so, I won't stop you. We'll go
with Kotori tomorrow. Okay, Maria. Think about
shops to visit. I don't know what girls like."	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. We'll schedule a raincheck tomorrow.
I trust you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Okay! That's that. We should get ready to leave.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Understood.
