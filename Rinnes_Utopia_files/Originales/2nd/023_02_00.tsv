Message	Shido	"So much happened in the morning, but I managed to
finish breakfast. So what should I do today?"	
Message	Tohka	I have a good idea, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you're energetic. Okay, sure. Go ahead, Tohka
Yatogami-san. Let's hear your idea."	
Message	Tohka	Yes. We're going on a date!	
Message	Shido	I-I knew it. I had a feeling you'd say that.	
Message	Tohka	O-Oh, you don't want to?	
Message	Shido	No, that's not it.	
Message	None	"(But there's so many people here. If I agree to a
date with Tohka, I know it's going to be chaotic.)"	
Message	Shido	"I mean, we're all gathered here, so why don't we
do something together?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, I see...!	
Message	Origami	Then I have a good idea.	
Message	Shido	"I have a bad feeling about this, but go ahead.
What's your idea?"	
Message	Origami	"Shido and I will go on a date. The others will
watch from behind. That way, everyone can
participate."	
Message	Tohka	What are you talking about?! You rotten...	
Message	Shido	"I knew this would happen. So seriously, what
should we do?"	
Message	Kotori	Then, how about this?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kotori. You have any good ideas?	
Message	Kotori	"Why don't we all go to a karaoke room? That way we
can all participate."	
Message	Shido	I see. That's true.	
Message	Yoshino	Karaoke... I... want to try.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ohhh, Yoshino seems curious."	
Message	Kurumi	My, that does sound fun.	
Message	Miku	If it's singing, I am unchallenged.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe, interesting. We tornadoes are
amazing singers."	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. I like to sing.	
Message	Shido	"This seems really good. Tohka, Origami, is that
okay with you two?"	
Message	Origami	No problem.	
Message	Tohka	Sure, karaoke is fun!	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, these two sang at the
culture festival. Tohka and Origami sang almost
to the point of making professionals look bad.)"	
Message	Kotori	I told you it was a good idea.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you're amazing as usual. But there are other
things we can do in a big group. I'm surprised you
decided on this."	
Message	Kotori	"You idiot. It's the opposite. I figured singing
would be good, so that's why I chose karaoke."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean the opposite?	
Message	Kotori	"I know Arusu can understand singing, but I don't
think she's ever experienced it."	
Message	Kotori	"By experiencing it, she might have some kind of
change of heart. I admit, it's sort of wishful
thinking."	
Message	Shido	I see. I get it.	
Message	None	"(With that said, we all decided to go to karaoke
in the afternoon.)"	
Message	None	"(And so, here we are. I went to the bathroom first
and then to the karaoke room...)"	
Message	Tohka	Wow, Shido. This room is all-you-can-sing?	
Message	Shido	"That's right, Tohka. Oh, but don't just put in all
the songs you want. Make sure to take turns..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san. Don't just stand there, why don't you
sit? Or, do you not want to sit next to me?"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, this seat is open, too. Or you can sit on
my lap..."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha...	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san... I don't know how to put
in the songs..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's it. Go, Yoshino! Nonchalantly sit next to\nShido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	Oh. H-Hey, wait. Let me go over there.	
Message	Kaguya	Wahhh! Shido, listen to me!	
Message	Shido	Why are you so upset, Kaguya?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Compassion. She challenged Miku to karaoke and
lost. There, there, Kaguya. You're a strong girl."	
Message	Shido	"Ohhh, you did the score battle and lost, huh?
It was pretty bold of you to challenge Miku in
singing."	
Message	Kaguya	"I wanted to attack a powerful enemy. But the Night
Siren's voice just broke me... *sniffle*..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Translation. This is the result of her trying to
redeem herself from the culture festival."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see.	
Message	Miku	"Hehe. I wouldn't lose a singing battle. Darling,
praise me."	
Message	Shido	"Miku, you're amazing... Wait, they're all above 98
points?! Wow..."	
Message	None	(Man, she should go easy on them a little.)	
Message	None	"(We just got in, but it sure is lively. Well, it
seems like everyone's enjoying themselves,
so I guess it's good that we came...)"	
Message	Kotori	"Why are you looking all proud of yourself for?
Come here."	
Message	Shido	"What is it, Kotori? Everyone seems to be having
fun, it's great."	
Message	Kotori	"Don't "it's great" me. Don't just have fun. Make
sure to flag an event with the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh right. I guess our lives are on the
line, huh?"	
Message	Shido	I'm going to go check up on Maria, then.	
Message	Kotori	Yes, go.	
Message	None	(Where's Maria sitting?)	
Message	None	"(Oh, there she is. She's sitting alone in the
corner. I'm going to move over.)"	
Message	Shido	So what do you think, Maria? Um... You having fun?	
Message	Maria	"Yes, Shido. It's... very interesting. Singing is
different when you actually hear it."	
Message	Shido	"I know, right? It's fun to sing with everyone. Do
you not want to sing anything, Maria? I can
teach you."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I'm fine. Rather, I wish to hear you sing
with someone, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Me...?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I heard that singing with someone is called a
duet. I think it would be a great situation to
observe."	
Message	None	"(I see. A duet, huh... If Maria wants to see it, I
guess I could give it a try.)"	
Message	None	(But who should I sing with?)	
Choice		Tohka	
Choice		Origami	
Choice		Yoshino	
Choice		Kurumi	
Choice		Next	
Choice		Kotori	
Choice		The Yamai Sisters	
Choice		Miku	
Choice		Previous	
Message	Shido	All right, Tohka. Let's sing together!	
Message	Tohka	"Okay, Shido! We're singing together?
Perfect timing."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, great!
...Wait, what?"	
Message	Tohka	"You see, this book doesn't have many songs
I know..."	
Message	Shido	Oh...!	
Message	None	"(Oh, yeah. Tohka's a Spirit, so she's not familiar
with the world. She doesn't have many songs in her
repertoire.)"	
Message	Shido	I see... Then... what should we do?	
Message	Tohka	Any song you know, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Songs I know? But then you won't be able to sing,
Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	"It's fine. I will learn it as I hear you sing.
For the lyrics, I just need to look at the
screen, don't I?"	
Message	None	"(I see. Tohka's quick at learning songs by
listening. She must have a good musical
sense to start.)"	
Message	Shido	Got it, Tohka! Follow me!	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	You don't have to apologize, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"No, I let my guard down. I thought it would
be okay if the lyrics were on the screen, but I
didn't think there would be so much English."	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah... I'm not good at English. My grades aren't
very good."	
Message	Tohka	"But still, no need to apologize. I had fun just
mimicking your song."	
Message	Shido	Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido. Sing another song. It was fun
singing with you."	
Message	Shido	...Okay. I'll choose a song you might know, then.	
Message	None	"(For the next song I chose, as expected, Tohka
sang random lyrics. But she still seemed to have
fun, so I think it's all right?)"	
Message	None	"(I sense someone staring...
Origami is staring at me.)"	
Message	Shido	Uh, Origami. Do you want to sing together?	
Message	Origami	Yes.	
Message	None	"(That was fast! She answered before I could even
blink.)"	
Message	Shido	Th-Then... Let's sing a song together.	
Message	Origami	Got it. Come here next to me...	
Message	Shido	"We're just singing together, so I don't think I
need to move seats..."	
Message	Origami	"That's not true. This is a necessity. We need to
be in sync, so we should be near one another."	
Message	Origami	If you want, you can sit on my lap...	
Message	Shido	"I-I'll sit next to you! Please, let me just sit
next to you!"	
Message	Origami	Yeah...? Or, I don't mind sitting on your lap.	
Message	Shido	"Origami, what do you want to sing?! Let's choose a
song!"	
Message	Origami	...I see. Got it.	
Message	None	(Why does she look so sad?!)	
Message	Origami	You can choose the song.	
Message	Shido	Are you sure?	
Message	Origami	"I don't mind. I can sing most songs. So please
choose freely..."	
Message	Shido	I see. If that's what you say.	
Message	None	"(It's not like there was a song I really wanted to
sing, so I chose a generic pop song that I figured
Origami would know.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh... It's starting.	
Message	Origami	～, ～	
Message	None	"(Origami is an amazing singer. Although it's not
like the power of Miku's singing as a Spirit, it's
still amazing.)"	
Message	None	"(If only she had an expression. No matter how much
emotion's in her voice, her expression still
doesn't change.)"	
Message	None	(That expression... That face...)	
Message	Shido	Close! Origami, your face is too close!	
Message	Origami	Phew... My duet with Shido was very fun.	
Message	Shido	I see... That's nice. I'm really tired.	
Message	Origami	It was amazing, climaxing with Shido.	
Message	Shido	"In terms of singing, right?! The key was
pretty high."	
Message	Origami	...It was amazing.	
Message	None	"(She sure seems to be entranced, but I guess she's
satisfied from the singing. That's how I decided
to take it.)"	
Message	Shido	So, who should I sing with...?	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yoshino? What's the matter?	
Message	Yoshino	...Um, would you like to sing with me?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, hey, Shido-kun. Sing with us!"	
Message	Shido	Sure, let's sing together.	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Isn't that nice, Yoshino!"	
Message	None	"(That's so sweet. Come to think of it, I don't
really hang out with Yoshino like this. I want
her to have a good time.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, what kind of song do you want to sing,
Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... um... I have a song I want to sing.	
Message	Shido	Oh, really?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Despite her appearance, Yoshino sure loves TV.\nShe can sing any popular song."	
Message	Yoshino	...Um, please leave it to me! Um, the number is...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you can do it yourself? Wait... Yoshinon,
you're going to sing too?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido. Don't be a dummy. I'll just watch so I\ndon't get in between you two."	
Message	Shido	...? What do you mean?	
Message	None	"(As I pondered that, the song that Yoshino chose
began to play.)"	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	"(What Yoshino chose was a pure love song. The
intro alone made Yoshino blush.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Woo-hooo!"	
Message	None	"(Th-This is embarrassing. But no, Yoshino chose
the song for me. I have to sing it!)"	
Message	Yoshino	"Maybe only you are the one to wake me up..."\n*whimper*... Shido-san, please don't look at me\ntoo much...	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun next! It's your part next!"	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. Uh... "I used to like you when I was a
kid"..."	
Message	Yoshino	Ahhh! Sh-Shido-san, I'm embarrassed.	
Message	None	"(This isn't good. Yoshino is blushing so much that
it's making me blush. This is a lot harder than I
anticipated!)"	
Message	None	"(We continued to sing as we both turned red
looking at one another, but managed to finish.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Would you like to sing with me?	
Message	Shido	A duet with you?	
Message	Kurumi	I'd love to sing with you.	
Message	None	"(*Grunt* I just got the chills. Her eyes looked
like she caught some kind of prey.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, hmm... What should I do?	
Message	Kurumi	"You don't want to sing with me, huh? That makes
me so sad, I want to cry."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, Kurumi. Let's sing together.	
Message	None	(Ngh... It's not fair that she says it like that.)	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... Thank you. I have an idea.	
Message	Shido	Idea...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, so this is what she means.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi's idea was for us to sing while holding
hands, but with a rule that if I let go or stopped
singing, I'd get hit with a penalty.)"	
Message	Shido	I feel like I'm in a trap.	
Message	Kurumi	Did you say something?	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing.	
Message	Kurumi	I see. Then it's your turn, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Okay....	
Message	Shido	Whoaaa, what the...!	
Message	None	"(Kurumi entwined her fingers in mine and was
rubbing the back of my hand.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Go ahead, Shido-san. Sing.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi completely cornered me. Is this what she
planned?!)"	
Message	Shido	Uh... Ah... Ohhhh!	
Message	None	(Kurumi's finger movements made me... Made me...!)	
Message	Kurumi	"*Giggle*. You did really well, Shido-san. So, what
kind of punishment will you receive?"	
Message	None	"(In the end, I couldn't take it, and let go of her
hand.)"	
Message	Shido	Please be nice.	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. Let's see... Can you sing another song
with me?"	
Message	Shido	P-Please, nooooo!	
Message	None	(Kurumi's plotting continued to trouble me.)	
Message	None	(All right, I made up my mind!)	
Message	Shido	Kotori, let's sing together.	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What?! M-Me...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. We might as well have a sibling duet.	
Message	Kotori	Don't worry about me. Sing with Tohka or Yoshino.	
Message	Shido	"Why are you so embarrassed? Don't act tough, just
sing with me. It's okay for you to play around
from time to time."	
Message	Shido	"And besides, I want to enjoy karaoke. I haven't
gone in a while. Come on."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido... I-If you say so, fine.
I guess I can sing."	
Message	None	"(All right. I was thinking of Reine-san's advice,
but it seems like it worked.)"	
Message	None	"(Reine-san... Is she still watching through the
monitor? I need to thank her. Thank you,
Reine-san.)"	
Message	Kotori	...Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing. So what should we sing?	
Message	Kotori	Shido... You can sing any song, right?	
Message	None	"(There's fire in Kotori's eyes. She is going to
sing that song...!)"	
Message	Shido	Bring it on. I will follow you to the end.	
Message	Kotori	Interesting...! Show me what you've got.	
Message	Kotori	This is my...	
Message	Shido	This is my...	
Message	Kotori	Super medley!	
Message	None	"(Well.. It's just a medley of anime songs and hero
themes. But they were all shouting songs where you
scream your lungs out and lose your voice.)"	
Message	Shido	"But I'm going to show you that I can keep up this
time!"	
Message	None	"(I hope my shouting gets through. I'm pushing it
to my limit...!)"	
Message	Kotori	Over already? It was just one set.	
Message	Shido	"*Cough, cough*... I can... still... si...
*choke*... *grunt*... I can't..."	
Message	None	"(I lost yet again. I could see Kotori's twin tails
fluttering. Ah... What red. It's as if I'm looking
at a sunset.)"	
Message	Kotori	"I have the mic. I want to go one more set. Tohka,
you want to sing? Come on up here."	
Message	None	"(As my consciousness faded, I could hear Kotori's
voice from afar. I lost...)"	
Message	None	(Hmmm. Who should I sing with?)	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Seems like you're contemplating. Sing with
the Spirit duo...!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Shido, let's sing together.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kaguya. Yuzuru. You've come to invite me?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... You belong to us, yet you act
like you don't."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Kaguya has been looking at you like a
puppy wanting her master's attention."	
Message	Kaguya	"Shut up, Yuzuru! That's totally not true. And I'm
not a puppy, I'm a three-headed dog."	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya, you're not making any sense... But thanks
for the invite. Let's sing together."	
Message	Kaguya	"...Okay! Hehe... When we Hurricane Children and
Shido combine forces, we become the Ultimate Trio."	
Message	Shido	"Well, we're just three people singing. You guys
must be really good at karaoke."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. You know that we challenged one
another 99 times before we met you, Shido."	
Message	Kaguya	"Of course. Karaoke is our pastime of choice when
we're bored."	
Message	Shido	I see... So, you guys compete even at karaoke.	
Message	Kaguya	"Now, Shido! I've prepared the song. Are you ready?
You can beg for your life now!"	
Message	Shido	"What kind of karaoke is this?!
...Oh, the intro sounds like a rock song."	
Message	Kaguya	"Listen carefully. The maddening play of the
phantom of the Yamais. The stars in the
heavens will come falling down."	
Message	Shido	"...Hey, Yuzuru. What is up with that chanting? Or
is she singing?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Support. Please don't mind her. It's Kaguya's
usual sickness."	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe... Now it's time for Misa!	
Message	None	(This is getting crazy.)	
Message	Shido	Well, you guys were pretty good.	
Message	Kaguya	"...O...f...cour... *pant, pant*... se...
This is... nothing for us... Yama..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Praise. Shido, I had fun.	
Message	None	"(In the end, Kaguya continued to scream-sing her
heart out. She'll definitely wear herself out at
this rate.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Shi...do... One more... song...	
Message	Shido	"Don't push it, Kaguya. Rest for a while.
Yuzuru, let her sleep there."	
Message	Yuzuru	Rest. Kaguya, please calm down...	
Message	Kaguya	*Whimper*...	
Message	Shido	Kaguya, you pushed yourself too far...!	
Message	None	"(In the end, Yuzuru and I took care of Kaguya, who
was knocked out.)"	
Message	None	"(Who do I want to sing with? I can't help but look
at Miku.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Miku. You want to sing the next one together?	
Message	Miku	Oh, darling, you've come to invite me?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Well, at the school festival we were
enemies, remember? I figured it'd be so
nice to sing with you this time."	
Message	Miku	Hehe. I would never turn down a request from you.	
Message	Shido	Oh, really? That's awesome. Glad I asked you.	
Message	Miku	"But I have one request. Will you listen?
To my request, that is."	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	None	"(Why do I have a bad feeling about this? What is
she going to ask me?)"	
Message	Miku	Wow... You look so good in that outfit.	
Message	Miku	Amazing, Shiori-san!	
Message	Shiori	Hey, Miku... Where did you find this costume?	
Message	Miku	"Huh? Well, when we entered, the front had a sign
that they also had cosplay costumes, so I went and
borrowed it."	
Message	None	(Crap... I wasn't paying attention.)	
Message	Shiori	H-Hey Miku? If I take this off...	
Message	Miku	"You can't. And besides, you're going to sing my
song with me. We have to be girls."	
Message	None	(Ah. Miku still loves girls, huh...)	
Message	Shiori	Damn it, then I'm going to go all out.	
Message	Shido	"*Whimper* I feel like I lost an important
part of me."	
Message	Miku	"Now, now, don't be like that! You were adorable,
darling."	
Message	Shido	Please, forget what you saw.	
Message	Miku	"Awww, that's too bad... Then, how was my song?
I sang it for you."	
Message	None	"(That's right. I was singing with Miku. I was too
preoccupied with myself dressed as a girl...)"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it was great. You're amazing as always.	
Message	Miku	Hehe, thank you. That makes me so happy.	
Message	Shido	Jeez, you're exaggerating...	
Message	Miku	"No, I'm not. I mean... you're the most precious
person in the whole wide world."	
Message	None	"(I can never beat Miku. She's really made me feel
this way.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's been a while since I sang so much. It seems
like everyone's happy."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Where's Maria...?	
Message	None	"(I looked around, and saw Maria, who appeared to be
lost in thought.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria. Let's go home.	
Message	Shido	How did you like today? Did you see anything new?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. It was a very valuable experience... I'm
going to take these results and gather new data."	
Message	Shido	Maria, don't tell me...	
Message	Maria	"I feel like I'm close to an answer.
So please, show me."	
Message	Shido	Okay, I'll cooperate.	
Message	None	"(I saw Maria's expression as my consciousness went
dark. I felt like she was smiling.)"
