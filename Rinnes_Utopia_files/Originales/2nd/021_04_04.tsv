Message	Kurumi	My, Shido-san. Welcome home.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh! Kurumi, what are you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	I was waiting for your return.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... This feels new...	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my... So you must be remembering what happened
earlier. That was a purely fictitious incident.
I am not usually that unruly."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, I'm sure. But, it was refreshing to see
that side of you, Kurumi."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. It was new for me as well having you take
care of me so much. We can continue where we
left off."	
Message	Shido	"No offense, but seriously no thanks. My heart
wouldn't last..."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my... That's unfortunate. So then, what
happened to Arusu-san? It appears she's not
home yet."	
Message	Shido	"What? Really? Oh come to think of it, I was
looking for Maria and I forgot..."	
Message	Kurumi	That sounds quite rude of you.	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, I didn't mean for it to be... Anyways,
I should go look for her. She may still be at
school."	
Message	Kurumi	If you don't mind, I will join you.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	None	"(This is a weird situation. I never thought I'd go
looking for Maria with Kurumi.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Here.	
Message	Shido	Ahh!	
Message	Kurumi	"My, Shido-san. You sure scream like a maiden. You
don't have to be so scared. I won't eat you alive."	
Message	Shido	When you say that, it doesn't sound like a joke!	
Message	Kurumi	"I mean, we're alone, but you're so deep in
thought. It's rude to ignore a girl like this."	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry.	
Message	Kurumi	Were you thinking about Arusu-san?	
Message	Shido	"Kind of... I'm just not sure if I'm able to show
her what she wants. I'm not very confident
that I can."	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh? How rare. Shido-san, you've always been so
unjustifiably confident."	
Message	Shido	Is that what you think of me?	
Message	Kurumi	"Once you say it, you make it happen. That is the
kind of person you are."	
Message	Shido	Hm... I'm not sure if you're comforting me...	
Message	Kurumi	"Well, neither do I. Anyways, we're almost at the
school. Do you have any idea where she could be?"	
Message	Shido	Hm... I'm not sure.	
Message	Shido	There you are... Maria, let's go home.	
Message	Maria	Shido? So you've found me.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Maria? Did you find something
interesting at school?"	
Message	Maria	...Yes. There was something like that.	
Message	Shido	What was it?	
Message	Maria	"More importantly... I'm happy that you've come to
look for me."	
Message	Kurumi	M-Maria?! What's the matter...?!	
Message	Shido	Just as I thought. The reaction I expected.	
Message	Maria	Th-The reaction you expected? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"I thought that if I did this, you'd come looking
for me. If you do this in a game, your heart skips
a beat, right?"	
Message	Maria	Maria...	
Message	Shido	"(I knew it. I think Maria is slowly starting to
change.)"	
Message	None	(I think Maria is slowly starting to change.)	
Message	Kurumi	"This is all very nice, but we should head home
soon or it'll be late. Or... do you plan on
staying like that forever, Shido-san?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh, no. Let's go home! Maria, you're good,
right?"	
Message	Maria	Yes, that was plenty.	
Message	None	"(With that said, Maria moved away from me and
began to walk.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"You sure seem to be happy. Aren't you glad,
Shido-san?"	
Message	Shido	N-No... It's not like that.
