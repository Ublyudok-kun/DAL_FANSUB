Message	Shido	I never thought today would come...	
Message	None	"(I'm here at my friend's memorial service. She was
a dear friend to me. And that friend is...)"	
Message	Shido	"Why did you have to die, Yoshinon... How can you
leave someone you care about behind like this..."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino... Are you okay?	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, Shido-san... *sniffle*...*sniffle*...	
Message	Shido	It's so unfortunate... She... was still so young.	
Message	None	"(Looking at the funeral photo, it was hard to
determine her age, but Yoshinon was my classmate.)"	
Message	None	"(We both pursued Yoshino, but the one Yoshino
ended up marrying was Yoshinon.)"	
Message	Shido	"Why did you die, Yoshinon? How is Yoshino going to
live on by herself?"	
Message	Shido	"I surrendered Yoshino's hand to you. I trusted
you. How could you leave us? You're breaking
her heart."	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san... Thank you for coming. I'm sure
Yoshinon would have appreciated it.
*sniffle*...*sniffle*."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino tightly embraced the funeral photo.
Seeing the nape of her neck was almost reviving
the feelings I had for her before.)"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, I want to support you... I'm serious.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"I'm sure Yoshinon doesn't want
to see you sad, either."	
Message	Yoshino	"...I'm sorry, Shido-san. I'm still not
ready yet..."	
Message	None	"(I don't blame her. I know I'm kind of rushing it.
But even then, I wanted to support Yoshino. I just
can't leave her be when she's crying like this.)"	
Message	None	"(She's enduring this sorrow all on her own. I want
to be the man that saves Yoshino from this.)"	
Message	Shido	I want to help you forget your sorrow. Yoshino...!	
Message	None	"(Sorry, Yoshinon. I'm going to come on strong. And
with that, I hugged Yoshino tightly from behind.)"	
Message	Yoshino	N-No... We can't, Shido-san...!	
Message	Shido	"I'll make you forget. All your sorrows,
everything."	
Message	Yoshino	No, Shido-san! Yoshinon... is watching.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(Hmm... If I picture Yoshinon here,
I can't focus.)"	
Message	None	(My grip loosened, and Yoshino gently moved away.)	
Message	None	"(Yoshino didn't seem like she was completely
against it. I can tell that she trusts me. But
seeing Yoshinon's photo...)"	
Message	Shido	"It's all your fault, Yoshinon. Things seem to have
become interesting..."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	None	"(Oops, now isn't the time to be relaxing. I just
vowed to stop Yoshino from crying.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yoshino? What can I do to get you to consider
me?"	
Message	Yoshino	I... still can't picture it...	
Message	None	"(Can't picture it, huh... What do I do? I guess
I'm going to have to impress her so she could
open up to me.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay, Yoshino. Can you watch me for a second?	
Message	Yoshino	Watch you?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Remember how Yoshinon and I had a lot of
stupid competitions back when we were students?
Because we wanted to impress you?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Yeah. You two did that a lot. Like... eating
contests."	
Message	Shido	"I think we were saying things like, "Whoever can
eat the most food you cooked is the most fitting
for you.""	
Message	Yoshino	And swimming competitions.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, competing to see who could save you if you
were drowning."	
Message	Yoshino	Or who could stop the alarm clock before it rang.	
Message	Shido	"Competing to see who could say good morning to you
first."	
Message	None	"(...Come to think of it, we had a lot of dumb
competitions. We must have been young.)"	
Message	Yoshino	But... what about it?	
Message	Shido	"Right. I'm going to do something amazing right
now. If you feel like I'm a more reliable man than
Yoshinon, I want you to accept my love."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"Well, we're at a point where I have no one to
compete against, but... I want you to watch me."	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay.	
Message	None	"(But the question is, what exactly should I do?
Something that could wipe away Yoshino's tears.)"	
Choice		Show her how powerful I am.	
Choice		Show her how supportive I can be.	
Message	None	"(I'm going to continue supporting Yoshino. To
prove myself to her, I need to show her my
strength.)"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, you wait here.	
Message	Yoshino	Okay...	
Message	Shido	Thanks for waiting.	
Message	Yoshino	"Um, where did you go? ...What's that you're
holding?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, it's an old phonebook. Yoshino, I'm going to
do my best and rip this apart. I want to show you
how powerful I am."	
Message	Yoshino	Okay...	
Message	None	"(All right, Shido Itsuka. Show her how much of a
man you are. Yoshino, Yoshinon, watch me.
Here I go...!)"	
Message	Shido	Uooooooohhhh!	
Message	None	"(*Grunt*... It's pretty tough to do. No, this is
for Yoshino...!)"	
Message	Shido	Uaaaaaaaaahhhhh!	
Message	None	"(I-I was somehow able to rip it apart. It was
really hard.)"	
Message	Shido	H-How was that?	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, did I look masculine? I wanted to show you how
strong I could be."	
Message	Yoshino	...I see.	
Message	Shido	Oh, did you see? How was it? Was I masculine?	
Message	Yoshino	Um...	
Message	None	"(Oh, it doesn't look like it's sinking in...?
This isn't good. She doesn't see it at all!)"	
Message	Yoshino	U-um. Shido-san? ...One more time.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Yoshino	If I see it once more, maybe I'll understand.	
Message	None	"(O-Oh, I see. Once more, huh. It's pretty tough
already, but it's for Yoshino. If I love her, then
I should be able to do it.)"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. H-Here I go... Uoooooooohhhhh!	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*!	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant*... What do you say, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Um... I don't really get it.	
Message	Shido	Still not good enough?!	
Message	Yoshino	"Sh-Shido-san. Once more. Just once more... please.
I feel like I'll get something if I see it again."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, got it. Third time, huh!	
Message	None	"(I don't know if I can do it. I think I'm almost
at my limit. This will be my final challenge.
Can I do it? Yoshinon, watch over me.)"	
Message	Shido	Th-Third time's the charm! Uooooohhhhh!	
Message	Shido	"*Wheeze*... *sigh*... How was it?
...Marry me, Yoshino."	
Message	None	"(It was such a pathetic confession. I have no more
left in me to try to make myself look good. But
even then, Yoshino came to my side.)"	
Message	Yoshino	...Heh... *giggle*.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	You... tried to make me laugh, didn't you?	
Message	Shido	Oh, well... um... Yeah...	
Message	Yoshino	Thank you, Shido-san... I'll think about it.	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...!	
Message	None	"(I don't know if this was what triggered it... but
eventually Yoshino and I got together.)"	
Message	None	"(I know we'll face many trials of our own in the
future. So Yoshinon, please watch over us.)"	
Message	None	"(The power to heal Yoshino, engulfed in sorrow.
What I need to showcase to her is how supportive
I can be.)"	
Message	Shido	"All right, I've made up my mind. Yoshino, I want
you to see how supportive I can be. So to show
you that, can I hug you?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? W-Well. I'm not ready for it now...	
Message	None	"(C-Crap... I just did that earlier. My supportive
skills are about to break.)"	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. I don't blame you. We're in front of
Yoshinon. That was inappropriate of me. Th-Then,
what can I do?"	
Message	None	(Crap, is there anything I can do?)	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I know. Can you hold onto me, Yoshino? They
say a good man can speak words through his back,
so hold onto my back."	
Message	Yoshino	Your back, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What do you say? Or does that still make you
uncomfortable?"	
Message	Yoshino	"No, it's fine. You're... doing something for me.
Please lend me your back, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Bring it on.	
Message	None	"(I turned my back to her, and Yoshino softly
leaned on me from behind. I could feel her
warmth... So... what do I do from here?)"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san. What do I do now?	
Message	Shido	"J-Just stay like that for however long you want.
I'll just stand here as your sturdy support."	
Message	None	"(I tried to say something cool, but I really had
no plans for this.)"	
Message	None	"(What do I do? Do I have what it takes to be
supportive right now? Honestly, even for me,
I feel like my actions are pretty pathetic.)"	
Message	Yoshino	*Sniffle, sniffle*...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, are you crying?	
Message	Yoshino	Sorry, Shido-san... But it's so painful...	
Message	Shido	"No, it's fine. You can cry it out. I won't go
anywhere."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino cried on my back. But I feel like the
pain in her voice had softened a bit.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	What is it, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Why were you and Yoshinon always competing?	
Message	Shido	"Hmm. I think we were happy just expressing to you
how much we loved you, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	It's a happy feeling to love someone...	
Message	Shido	"And if it's possible, I would love for you to fall
in love with me and become happy."	
Message	None	"(I feel like Yoshino giggled behind me. Hey,
Yoshinon? I promise I'll make her happy.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know if this was what triggered it... but
eventually Yoshino and I got together.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm sure we'll face many trials of our own in the
future. So Yoshinon, please watch over us.)"
