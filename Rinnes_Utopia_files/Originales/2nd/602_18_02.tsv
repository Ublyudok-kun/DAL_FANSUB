Message	None	"(Quite some time has passed since Origami
and I started dating.)"	
Message	None	"(Our relationship is stronger than ever.
It really feels like we can trust each other.)"	
Message	None	"(Today, we were spending some alone time
together.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, I propose an idea.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Origami	"All this time, I had been putting forth too
much effort in pursuing you."	
Message	Shido	W-Well, you were kinda aggressive at times.	
Message	Origami	"I believed it to be the way to prove my love
to you."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, I could see that. It got overwhelming
sometimes."	
Message	Origami	"However, I felt heavy guilt, and have since
realized it was unacceptable."	
Message	Shido	Well, everything is better in moderation.	
Message	Origami	"From now on, I will not be a woman who
pines after you, but rather will be the kind
of woman for whom you pine."	
Message	Shido	Oh. I can't wait for that.	
Message	Origami	I will be the woman you need.	
Message	Shido	Um, Origami, that's not necessary.	
Message	Origami	"Why not? I want you to tell me whenever
you want something from me."	
Message	Shido	It's because I already do need you, Origami.	
Message	Origami	...Really?	
Message	Shido	"Yes. The only thing I want is to be next to
you, Origami."	
Message	Origami	"But I want you to want me more, Shido.
Is anything holding you back?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, not exactly... But we're still students,
you know? Maybe it's good to show some
self-restraint."	
Message	Origami	"Then I will. I choose not to pursue you,
but rather will be the person you want
to pursue."	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Origami	"I will no longer be she who sniffs gym clothes,
and will instead be the one whose gym clothes
are sniffed."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, about that...	
Message	Origami	...Is that wrong?	
Message	Shido	U-Um, let's not be too hasty.	
Message	Origami	"Okay. You might not know it now, but one
day, I'm sure you will want me."	
Message	Shido	I... I'll try.	
Message	None	"(I looked at my watch and saw that it was
pretty late. We lost track of time.)"	
Message	Shido	Look at the time.	
Message	Origami	"...I can't stay like this. It is almost time for
training."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Training?	
Message	Origami	That's right.	
Message	None	(What could it be? Is she on a diet?)	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Origami. I'm not sure what it is, but
don't do anything bad for your health, okay?"	
Message	Origami	"Not a problem. On the contrary, I am taking
good care of my health. Hang on."	
Message	Shido	Huh? You're doing it here?	
Message	None	"(Origami went into the corner of the room
and began removing her clothes.)"	
Message	Shido	Wait! What are you doing, Origami?!	
Message	None	"(She took off her shirt, completely exposing
her upper body.)"	
Message	None	"(I saw her porcelain skin, and she just barely
blocked her chest with her arms. I gulped.)"	
Message	None	"(She wasn't the least bit shy, but her motive
didn't seem inherently naughty.)"	
Message	None	"(I find her stunning, making it impossible to
look away. More like, I didn't want to.)"	
Message	None	"(Her smooth, pale skin shone in the light
of the sunset. It was divine. Her beauty
took my breath away.)"	
Message	Shido	Origami, here you go again...	
Message	None	(The words left my mouth meekly.)	
Message	Origami	I thought about what you wanted, and so―	
Message	Origami	"My conclusion was to work hard for a bigger
chest."	
Message	Shido	HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THAT CONCLUSION?!	
Message	None	"(Her train of thoughts eludes me. All of
a sudden, it was like my body was made
of gelatin.)"	
Message	Origami	"I found the bikini issue in your room,
compared my body to the models inside,
and came to a decision."	
Message	Shido	"Issue... You mean the manga magazine I have?
When did you find it, or look through it?"	
Message	Origami	I know everything that belongs here.	
Message	Shido	...Gotcha.	
Message	Origami	"Unfortunately, I could not find anything more
explicit."	
Message	Shido	"Please don't! Don't go through my stuff
when I'm not around."	
Message	Origami	"What I did notice, however, were several
items featuring voluptuous women."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's not exactly uncommon inside
magazines, but that's not why I'm reading
them."	
Message	Origami	"That is not true. You have a preference for
women with bigger chests. I have caught
you oogling women on our dates."	
Message	Shido	"D-Did I do that? Even if I did, um, it was
nothing more than instinct..."	
Message	Origami	So you are telling me you hate large chests?	
Message	Shido	Erm... Well, when you put it that way, um...	
Message	Origami	"So, big chests are the surest way to stimulate
a man's instincts."	
Message	Shido	I-Is that so...?	
Message	Origami	"That is why I have been doing whatever I can
to expand my chest."	
Message	Shido	H-How do you manage that?!	
Message	Origami	"I heard by massaging them, they increase in
size. Moving every day helps your chest grow."	
Message	Shido	Really?! Then could you do it another time?	
Message	Origami	"If I am being observed, the growth hormones
may secrete in bigger quantities."	
Message	Shido	"Think about this objectively. Do you think
every woman in the world with a big chest
is doing that?"	
Message	Origami	It is certainly likely.	
Message	Shido	Where are you getting this info from?!	
Message	Origami	"Speaking to your chest also aids their
growth. Shido, try speaking to my chest."	
Message	Shido	What are they, plants?!	
Message	Origami	...I believe it is working already!	
Message	Shido	If they grow that quick, that's terrifying!	
Message	Origami	"Shido, massage them to stimulate the
growth. I do not mind."	
Message	Shido	"I can't! And what happened to the whole me
chasing after you instead of vice versa thing?!"	
Message	Origami	Surely by now you cannot resist me.	
Message	Shido	"Ergh... I mean, sure. You're beautiful, but...
you can't win if your only goal is to stimuate
me."	
Message	Origami	"If you want me, then take me. Do not
hold back. I am ready."	
Message	Shido	Jeez...	
Message	None	(In the end, Origami will always be Origami.)	
Message	None	(But... That's exactly what I love about her.)	
Message	Shido	Okay, Origami. I'll help you out.	
Message	Origami	Sh-Shido, at last... You're in the mood.	
Message	Shido	"You sure about this, Origami? You want me
to take you?"	
Message	Origami	"I would never deny you. Do with me what
you will."	
Message	Shido	Then...	
Message	None	(I stepped closer to Origami, then I softly...)	
Message	None	"(...put the shirt she was wearing onto her
shoulders.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...? What are you doing...?	
Message	Shido	Isn't it obvious, Origami?	
Message	None	(All I want to do with Origami is...)	
Message	Shido	"We're going on a date. Let's take a walk
while the sun sets."	
Message	Origami	...So you still refuse to give in?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. We have the rest of our lives for that.
Besides Origami, don't you want to savor it?"	
Message	Origami	"Oh, yes. Whatever you want is what I want.
Being with you is the sweetest treasure in
the world."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I enjoy being with you, too. Simply
walking and talking with you is all I want."	
Message	Origami	Forgive me, Shido. I may have rushed things.	
Message	Shido	It's fine. I accept you for who you are.	
Message	Origami	Right...	
Message	None	"(We took a stroll, watching the glow of
sunset fade into the hill.)"	
Message	None	"(My love for Origami is as vast as the sky,
which is why I chose to tell her now...)"	
Message	None	"(We trekked towards the place where we
could be closest to it...)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, why did you bring me here?	
Message	Shido	"Remember when you took me here?
I thought it'd make for a perfect getaway."	
Message	Origami	Perfect?	
Message	Shido	Yup. I don't think I can contain myself.	
Message	None	"(I stared deep into Origami's eyes. She
blushed a bit, perhaps feeling demure.)"	
Message	Origami	From what?	
Message	Shido	Origami... I love you.	
Message	None	"(I love you. I had never put it to words
before. I didn't know what love was.
At least, I never believed it myself.)"	
Message	None	"(But now, I can say for sure, I know.
This feeling is love.)"	
Message	Shido	"How you keep me on my toes. How you challenge
me. How I surprise you. How you make me laugh.
How you frustrate me. I love it all."	
Message	Shido	"How I want you, and how you want me.
I love how you love me."	
Message	Shido	"I want to be with you until the end of time.
As sure as the sun rises and falls, and becomes
morning once more. To be together forever."	
Message	Origami	Shido... I'm sorry.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"That's not what I mean. I thought I would be
the first to say it, but with how things turned
out today, you said it before me."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. You scared me. I thought that was
almost a rejection. But it's okay to let
me take the lead."	
Message	Origami	That may be true.	
Message	Shido	"Then, let me say it again. I want to be
with you forever."	
Message	Origami	Okay...	
Message	None	"(Origami's eyes sparkled above her quivering
lips, and she nodded quietly.)"	
Message	None	"(No words needed to be said. I took her into
my soft embrace.)"	
Message	None	(Beneath the sunset, our shadows became one.)
