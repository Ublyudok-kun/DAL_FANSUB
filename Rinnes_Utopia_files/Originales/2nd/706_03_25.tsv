Message	Shido	Did something happen? It's pretty noisy...	
Message	Shido	Traffic control?	
Message	Mana	"Whoops. This area's freaking off-limits.
"	
Message	Mana	Wait, Nii-sama...?	
Message	Shido	Mana, that outfit...	
Message	Mana	"Aah, well. It's just minor business. Even if
you're my Nii-sama, I can't talk right now."	
Message	Shido	No, it's all right. I understand.	
Message	None	"(It might mean some issue occurred around
here.)"	
Message	Mana	Well, it's freaking nothing huge.	
Message	Shido	Don't you think it's a little soon to call it?	
Message	Mana	"Panic was written all over your face, so
maybe it was bad of me to make you
worry."	
Message	None	"(Without thinking, I touched my face. It's not
like I could see my own expression. Mana's
smile loosened.)"	
Message	Mana	"You're freaking honest, Nii-sama, but you'll
never survive on the battlefield like that."	
Message	Shido	How can I respond to that...?	
Message	Mana	Ahaha...	
Message	None	(Mana flashed a smile, then spun around.)	
Message	Mana	"Well, I'll protect you with all I've got,
Nii-sama. Don't worry about a freaking
thing."	
Message	Shido	"I see... Thanks! Good luck at training. Don't
push yourself too hard, okay?"	
Message	Mana	Yes!
