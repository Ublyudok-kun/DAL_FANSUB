Message	Shido	Mmm...mmmm...	
Message	Shido	Mmm...	
Message	None	"(I had a feeling that I was about to wake up.
Somewhere between being half-awake and
half-asleep.)"	
Message	None	(Ah... I feel something warm and comforting...)	
Message	???	What the hell?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa! What the—?!	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, what is the meaning of this? I encourage
you to think real hard before answering."	
Message	Tohka	What... is going on...?!	
Message	Shido	Kotori, Tohka...? What... are you talking about?	
Message	Kotori	Okay, Onii-chan. Why don't you look beside you?	
Message	Shido	M-Maria...? What are you doing?!	
Message	Maria	Zzz...zzz...	
Message	Shido	She's sleeping?	
Message	Kotori	Yes, she's sleeping pretty soundly.	
Message	Tohka	B-But, Shido! I heard this was inappropriate!	
Message	Kotori	"I did want you to get information out of Arusu,
but I never expected you to go this route. You
should be ashamed of yourself, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	"W-W-Wait a minute! You guys have it all wrong.
Get information...? What are you talking about?"	
Message	Kotori	"Don't play dumb. I bet you were all, "Hehehe, I'm
going to ask her body." That's what you were
doing, right?!"	
Message	Shido	Of course not!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? What do you mean by asking her body? Can you
get a story out of a stomach?"	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not what she means... Tohka, what were
you saying was inappropriate?"	
Message	Tohka	"You can't sleep with Shido. If I'm allowed, I
would want to... But Kotori told me that a man and
woman should not sleep in the same bed together."	
Message	Shido	"Well, yeah... It doesn't look good. But besides
that... Why is Maria here?! I went to sleep alone!"	
Message	Kotori	...You're calling her by a different name.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, she told me she wanted me to call her by
another name."	
Message	Kotori	Oh... So it's like that, is it?	
Message	Shido	"Like what?! Nothing happened, so can you not twist
my arm?"	
Message	Maria	Mmm... *groan*... Ooh... Good morning, Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, morning. Sorry for asking you so early and
all, but..."	
Message	Maria	Yes, what is it?	
Message	Shido	Why did you sleep here?	
Message	Maria	Why...?	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, I knew it. You subconsciously brought Arusu
in—"	
Message	Shido	I didn't! ...Right?	
Message	None	"(Last night we looked at the stars together, and
then we came back home and I went to bed as
usual...)"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I entered Shido's bed on my own. That was a
choice I made independently."	
Message	Tohka	"What...?! I'm jealous... that you got to sleep
with Shido!"	
Message	Maria	"Jea...lous. You all love Shido Itsuka. Do you want
to sleep with him?"	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah! I'm sure it would make me happier and warmer
if we were together at night."	
Message	Kotori	I-I don't want to...	
Message	Shido	"But Kotori, you're the one I've slept with
the most."	
Message	Kotori	"That was when we were kids! We don't do that now.
I mean, God knows what you would do, you dummy!"	
Message	Shido	I wouldn't do anything!	
Message	Kotori	...Oh. Is that so?	
Message	Shido	"But in the past, after we watched any scary movie,
you would—"	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. We're talking about Arusu right now. So
Arusu, did you want to sleep with him like Tohka
wants to?"	
Message	Maria	"...Is that it? Perhaps I employed a first-person
method of simulating love...?"	
Message	Kotori	Maybe...? I mean, you were the one who did it.	
Message	Maria	For some reason, I don't know why.	
Message	Tohka	"So, how was it sleeping with Shido? Did you feel
happy? What was Shido like when he was sleeping?"	
Message	Maria	"He was... warm. But the rest... I didn't really
understand. But it was not unpleasant."	
Message	Shido	"You guys... can you get out of my room
already? I need to get dressed and cook
breakfast..."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! Let's eat breakfast together!	
Message	Maria	"I don't understand why I took this action.
Maybe... it's another type of bug."	
Message	Shido	Bug...? A bug...	
Message	None	(That can't be.)	
Message	Maria	...I will go downstairs as well.	
Message	Kotori	She doesn't know why she did what she did, huh...	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, Kotori? You need to go out,
too."	
Message	Kotori	"It's hard to believe Arusu would choose to do
this. Hey, Shido... do you think she's starting
to change?"	
Message	Shido	You think so? Come to think of it, maybe...	
Message	Shido	"It does seem that she has more emotions lately.
She's more expressive."	
Message	None	"(And besides, there's also the other Arusu that
I've met twice.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Regardless, change isn't bad. Those wheels could
be moving us closer to a breakthrough."	
Message	Kotori	"The current objective we need to fulfill is to
teach Arusu "love". But I don't even know if
that's possible."	
Message	Kotori	"However, if Arusu is what I assumed she was—an AI
Spirit—and if she uses that power to control the
virtual world, there is another way."	
Message	Kotori	To make her fall for you as a Spirit.	
Message	Shido	"You mentioned that yesterday, too... But we're in
virtual reality."	
Message	Shido	Then, uh... I-Isn't it pointless to kiss here?	
Message	Kotori	"Maybe. But even if it is, if we can make her
blush, we may be able to convince her."	
Message	Kotori	"So try to comply with whatever Arusu wants. But...
I won't forgive you if you pull what you did this
morning. Keep it appropriate."	
Message	Shido	"Well... I don't know if I can do anything to
convince her, but I'll try."	
Message	Kotori	"I'll leave her to you. So get dressed and make us
some food, Onii-chan."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Jeez, you're so good at using me.	
Message	Shido	School... Everyone's there, so it'll be tough.	
Message	Shido	"And besides, since it's not reality, I'm finding
it a waste of time to go to class."	
Message	Maria	"Shido... I'm going to join in your school
activities today."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, yeah. You came here yesterday, but no one
really acknowledges you, right?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. That was since I was set as an NPC. But I
reconfigured the settings today."	
Message	Maria	"However, there is a possibility that participating
as a student will interfere with my observation,
so I just changed the settings to observer."	
Message	Shido	"I see. I think that's fine. I felt bad because it
felt like you were being ignored."	
Message	Shido	But why did you want to change all of a sudden?	
Message	Maria	"I figured that by observing from another point of
view, I would be able to obtain different results
than usual."	
Message	Maria	"Even if I knew the class of each star and their
location, observing the night sky in person
was a different experience from pure theory."	
Message	Maria	"I figured in daily school life, I would need
to run actual simulations."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I think that's a good idea.	
Message	Tohka	I agree, too! School is fun!	
Message	Shido	"You'd better be nice to her, Tohka. You know more
about school, so be sure to teach Maria what she
doesn't know."	
Message	Tohka	Okay, got it! Leave it to me!	
Message	Kotori	"I agree. It's not like it'll change anything
drastically."	
Message	Kotori	Shido, don't forget what I told you this morning.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I know. I think it'll be fun for Maria to
experience having friends."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you're such a good guy. Well I guess that
makes you—"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Makes me what?	
Message	Kotori	...Nothing.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Tonomachi	Hey, Itsuka?!	
Message	Shido	You're noisy as usual, Tonomachi.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Who's that pretty girl?! She's obviously not
dressed in a uniform, and she doesn't seem
to be a transfer student..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you really do recognize her.	
Message	Tonomachi	Huh? What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	"Nothing. Uh... She's observing the school for
today. Her name is Maria Arusu.
Arusu, this is Tonomachi, the school idiot."	
Message	Maria	So I should call him Idiot Tonomachi? Understood.	
Message	Tonomachi	That's not my name! Itsuka, explain it to her!	
Message	Shido	Well, it's not a lie, so who cares.	
Message	Tonomachi	Nooooooooo!	
Message	Ai	Oh, Itsuka-kun, who is she? ...Don't tell me!	
Message	Mai	...You still have time. Return her to her parents.	
Message	Mii	"Even if after returning her, your sin won't be
absolved. What a tragedy..."	
Message	Shido	"Can you not treat me like some kind of kidnapper?
Maria, this is Ai, Mai, and Mii."	
Message	Ai	"And can you not refer to us like we're some kind
of singular unit?"	
Message	Mai	"And it's feeling kind of stale... I want a newer
vibe, like AMM48."	
Message	Shido	Where did the 48 come from?!	
Message	Mii	"No! If it's AMM, then everyone's going to think
we're missile attackers. I'm embarrassed."	
Message	Shido	No one would think that! Why would they?!	
Message	Origami	AMM. Attacking-Missile Mode is right.	
Message	Shido	"She thinks that...?! Oh, Origami. Hey, Maria said
she's going to observe the school today."	
Message	Origami	"Understood. But I want to make a request to Maria
Arusu."	
Message	Maria	Yes... What is it?	
Message	Origami	"As this is virtual reality, I want you to initiate
more events where I can be with Shido. That way,
it will speed up your research."	
Message	Maria	"If I can deem that it is beneficial, I shall
cooperate."	
Message	Origami	"I look forward to it. You can also lift any age
restrictions in the program."	
Message	Shido	No, you can't!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ya-hoo! Good morning, everybody! Yoshino's lesson\nis now beginning!"	
Message	Yoshino	G-Good morning.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yoshino and Yoshinon. Good morning. Maria's
observing today."	
Message	Yoshino	"Is that so...? Kind of like a class observation
day...?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I guess so. But... Yoshino, how did you know
about that?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Because I'm... a teacher...! I've been... studying
about school. A-Arusu-san... Are you going to
observe my class?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, yeah. You don't have to be in our class, so
you can be with Kaguya and Yuzuru too. Miku and
Kotori are also here."	
Message	Maria	"...There may be meaning in observing school life
in a place where you are absent."	
Message	Shido	I think either would work.	
Message	Maria	Either...	
Message	None	(She seems to be torn. Then...)	
Choice		You can be in my class.	
Choice		Why don't you go to the next class?	
Message	Shido	"I think you can be here. There's Tohka, Origami,
and me."	
Message	Maria	...Okay. Then I will do so.	
Message	Yoshino	W-Well... I'll be starting class now...!	
Message	Shido	"Why don't you go to the next class? I'm sure
you've had enough of this class."	
Message	Maria	You're right. Then I will head to the next class.	
Message	None	"(I know I suggested it, but I wonder if she'll be
okay...)"
