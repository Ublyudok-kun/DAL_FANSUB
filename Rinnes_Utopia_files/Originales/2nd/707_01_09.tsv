Message	Shido	Huh? Isn't that Kannazuki-san?	
Message	Kannazuki	Hello there, Shido-kun. Good day.	
Message	Shido	"Hello... Even Kannazuki-san's been recreated
as an NPC."	
Message	Kannazuki	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. It's nothing. Are you out shopping
or something?"	
Message	Kannazuki	No. I have business with Commander Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	With Kotori? But she's still in schoo—	
Message	Kannazuki	"Stop! Shido-kun! There's no need for you
to tell me!"	
Message	Shido	Er, but...	
Message	Kannazuki	"It's quite all right! It's all part of my plan to
stage a risky rendezvous with the commander!
I'm merely killing time!"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, are you serious...? I suppose I'll ask,
but why'd you plan that?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"If I'm successful, even if I'm on time, the
commander will yell at me and tell me I'm
late!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Even if I'm bordering on being on-time, that
feeling of getting rebuked for being tardy—!
Oh, my!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Kannazuki	"Listen closely. It's important not to be actually
late. But she will become unreasonable upset
regardless. A big self-contradiction!"	
Message	Shido	Um, got it. Well, good luck with that.	
Message	Kannazuki	Ohh, so you understand!	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm pretty sure what you're thinking and
what I'm thinking are completely different,
Kannazuki-san..."	
Message	None	"(This guy's got such a weird fetish, but he's
eerily spot-on at how Kotori acts...)"
