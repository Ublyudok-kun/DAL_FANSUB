Message	None	"(It all happened while I was on a date. I had
said that she could spend the night there when
Kotori was gone. She took me very seriously.)"	
Message	Miku	"Then, Kotori-chan won't be back until
tomorrow?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. She said she's spending the night at a
friend's house. I thought it'd be good for her
to have a change of pace, so I sent her off."	
Message	None	"(Since they're letting her stay at the house,
I wanted to gift something as a ""Thank You,"" but
Kotori dismissed it, calling it embarrassing.)"	
Message	Shido	"I felt like a parent with a rebellious daughter.
...Hey, Miku, are you listening?"	
Message	Miku	"Hm, I see. So Kotori-chan's not home today.
Which means no problems for us."	
Message	Shido	"Um, Miku-san? This is a random question,
but what do you mean by ""no problems""...?"	
Message	Miku	"You know what I mean! Spending the night
at your house, darling!!"	
Message	Shido	Wha? Hey, let's calm down.	
Message	Miku	"I couldn't possibly calm down! Darling, you
said it'd be fine when Kotori-chan wasn't
around, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Err, no! Please, keep it down, okay?
Everyone's listening!"	
Message	Customer A	My, my. Did you hear that?	
Message	Customer B	"Kids these days really are something. And here,
of all places!"	
Message	Customer C	"He thinks himself some kind of womanizer.
What a creep."	
Message	None	"(I could hear quiet laughter from people around
us... Maybe even some terrible insults, too.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'm begging you. Please don't say that stuff
out loud. And you're an idol, so you should be
more aware of your surroundings."	
Message	Miku	"I-I'm sorry, b-but I want to stay the night at
your house, darling."	
Message	None	"(Well, I do remember saying something to
that effect. If I think about it, it's less of a
problem if Kotori isn't home.)"	
Message	Shido	Er, but Miku, ordinarily this is...	
Message	Miku	Hmph! You promised me, didn't you?	
Message	None	(Oogh. When she gives me those eyes...)	
Message	Shido	"All right. You win, but I won't be able to
offer you much in terms of hospitality."	
Message	Miku	Aww, darling. I love you so much!	
Message	None	"(Oogh. I crumbled in only two seconds. I'm
such a sucker for her.)"	
Message	Miku	Yaaay, I'm so happy!	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's fine, but... is that really something
to be happy about?"	
Message	Miku	"But I'm staying the night, silly. I've heard
Tohka-chan's done it before, is that true?"	
Message	Shido	"Well that happens from time to time, like
when a Spirit's apartment is unlivable or
something..."	
Message	None	"(I see. Miku's my girlfriend, and I remember her
saying she wanted to do things that the rest of
the girls have done, too.)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay. If that's the case, then I'll give you a
proper reception. Let's break for today, and
meet at my place. Don't come empty-handed, okay?"	
Message	Miku	Yes, I understand. No take-backsies, okay?	
Message	Shido	"I know. I couldn't do that to you after seeing
how happy it makes you. And I'm always happy
when my girlfriend's happy."	
Message	Miku	Tee hee hee. Darling. I love you.	
Message	None	"(Still, it'll be a sleepover without Kotori.
Is that really okay?)"	
Message	Shido	"Now then. That settles prep for dinner. I
ended up making quite the feast, didn't I?
I hope Miku likes it."	
Message	Shido	"She should be here any minute now, huh?
I told her to come over as soon as she was
ready, but she's taking her time."	
Message	Shido	"If Kotori were here, I'm sure she'd say,
She's a girl, so of course she'll take time
getting ready!"" Hahaha…"	
Message	None	"(...I know she's only a little late, but I'm
getting nervous. No one else is here for
sure, right?)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa. That surprised me. Perfect timing...	
Message	None	(Okay, just calm down. Take deep breaths...)	
Message	Shido	All right, here I go.	
Message	Shido	Opening it now!	
Message	Shido	Welcome, Miku. Make yourself at home.	
Message	Miku	U-Um, I hope I'm not intruding.	
Message	Shido	...? Go ahead. Come inside.	
Message	Miku	Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Dinner will be ready soon.
Oh, that's right. Miku..."	
Message	Miku	"Wh-Wh-What is it!
Please wait, darling.
My heart isn't ready yet!"	
Message	Shido	"Er. I was just going to ask if you wanted
slippers."	
Message	Miku	"...Huh? Oh. S-Slippers, yes. T-Thank you
for being so attentive."	
Message	Shido	Of course. I mean, it's not much.	
Message	None	"(Well then. I wonder if something's wrong.
She's acting a little strange.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Miku? If you're not feeling well or
something, we can do this another time."	
Message	Miku	"Th-That's not the case at all. I'm feeling
perfectly well."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. Then, that's good. For now, come inside.	
Message	None	"(Although something with Miku seemed off,
for the moment, we decided to go ahead with
dinner.)"	
Message	Shido	"I still have to plate everything, but the food
should be done soon, so go ahead and have
a seat."	
Message	Miku	"Wow. Did you prepare all of this yourself,
darling?"	
Message	Shido	"Yup. Just wanted to give you a reception.
I thought I'd treat you, but then I kinda
went overboard."	
Message	None	"(I might've gone too far, as I ended up making
a full-course meal. Parboiled and chilled pork
shabu, pickled jellyfish, and potato salad.)"	
Message	None	"(A consomme-esque soup, spring rolls, and the
main dish, gratin, baking in the oven. I'm not
sure even I can finish all this food.)"	
Message	Shido	"I just thought I'd whip something up quickly
while I was waiting, but I got ahead of myself.
Miku, is there anything you don't like?"	
Message	Miku	"If it's something you made, darling, then
I'll eat anything!"	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. I'm glad to hear you say that. Well,
feel free to eat as much as you'd like."	
Message	Miku	U-Um... I actually made something, as well.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Miku	"I thought this would make for a perfect
late night snack."	
Message	None	"(As she said this, Miku pulled out a small
package.)"	
Message	Shido	"Ohh, sandwiches, huh? You made it even
though you didn't have much time?"	
Message	Miku	However, it might have been unnecessary.	
Message	Shido	That's not true. The more, the merrier.	
Message	None	(Either way, we decided to start eating.)	
Message	Shido	"Firstly, I think I'll try the sandwiches you
made, Miku!"	
Message	Miku	Erm, um, darling. You can have that afterwards.	
Message	Shido	"No can do. Especially since you made them.
Let me try it... *nom*."	
Message	Miku	H-How is it...?	
Message	Shido	"Mm, it's delicious. The butter on the bread
was a nice touch, too. Have you been practicing?"	
Message	None	"(This isn't a nice thing to say, but Miku never
struck me as someone who was good at cooking,
which means she had to have practiced a ton.)"	
Message	Miku	"Um. I just wanted to be worthy of being
your significant other, darling.
"	
Message	Miku	I'm so glad you think it's delicious.	
Message	None	"(I see. That explains why she was acting so
weird earlier.)"	
Message	Shido	Miku, thank you.	
Message	Shido	"Here. Please eat some of the food I made.
There's a lot, so have whatever you want."	
Message	Miku	Okaaay, I'll help myself～!	
Message	Shido	"Whew. It feels like I've eaten a ton, but
there's a lot leftover."	
Message	Miku	Yes, but it was quite delicious.	
Message	Shido	"That's good. Well worth all the effort of
making it."	
Message	None	"(Well, that leaves the other half for leftovers,
so I'll just consolidate what's left and eat it
tomorrow.)"	
Message	Shido	"Now then. Guess it's time for a bath and then
bedtime."	
Message	Miku	"Aw, already? It's still only 8 o'clock. I'm
not a grandma."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's true that it might be a little early
to get to bed. Hmmm, then should we play
a game? Or maybe watch some TV?"	
Message	None	"(It was a suddenly planned sleepover, so
there wasn't anything in particular prepared.
We could take a look at Kotori's movie shelf.)"	
Message	Miku	"U-Um, darling. If that's the case, I have one
request."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, what is it? Any suggestions? Nothing's
planned, so I'm all ears."	
Message	Miku	"R-Really, anything goes? You wouldn't take
it back, would you, darling?"	
Message	Shido	"Er, well, what I meant was you could suggest
anything you wanted, but..."	
Message	None	"(Huh. Why am I getting the strangest sense
of déjà vu...?)"	
Message	Miku	Anything goes, yes?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. What do you suggest, Miku?	
Message	None	(And so, what had ended up happening was...)	
Message	Miku	Um, darling. Why are you closing your eyes?	
Message	Shido	"N-No reason at all. Just got some water in
my eyes."	
Message	Miku	I see. Then, please take a look over here.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. R-Right...	
Message	None	(Agh, screw it!)	
Message	None	(To think I'd end up in this situation...)	
Message	Shido	Th-That's... I knew it was good, but wow...	
Message	Miku	Is something the matter～?	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's nothing!	
Message	None	(Shoot. I was being super obvious...)	
Message	Shido	I-I'll get out as soon as I'm warmed up.	
Message	Miku	"Aww, let's take our time. You just got in,
after all. If you don't properly warm up,
you'll get chilly, don't you know?"	
Message	None	"(Miku's request was for us to take a bath
together. I thought it'd be a big issue, but...)"	
Message	Shido	"In the end, I got pushed into it. Now,
here I am..."	
Message	None	"(A-Anyway, I better get out of the bath fast,
or my blood's gonna rush to my head.)"	
Message	Miku	Um, darling? I want to ask you something.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Miku	I don't know how to run the hot water.	
Message	Shido	Oh, just turn the handle right there.	
Message	Miku	"Um, I'm not sure if I can do it. Could you
show me how?"	
Message	None	"(Sh-Show you how...?! But if I do that, no
matter what, I'll see Miku's bare body.
Besides, who can't run hot water...?)"	
Message	Miku	Um, please hurry.	
Message	None	"(Urgh, damn it! I made up my mind and stood
up. I'll just avert my eyes.)"	
Message	Shido	"If you turn the handle like this, then you'll get
hot water. To stop it, turn it the other way.
Okay then..."	
Message	Miku	Yaaay! Thank you!	
Message	Shido	Hey Miku, don't grab my arm. I-It's dangerous!	
Message	Miku	Aw. You're so stingy, darling.	
Message	None	"(Whew. Somehow, she let me go. Looks like
I can return to the bathtub. That's a relief.)"	
Message	Miku	Um, darling...?	
Message	Shido	Gah! Wh-What is it this time?	
Message	Miku	Could you please wash my back?	
Message	Shido	"R-Right, your back.
...Your back?!"	
Message	None	"(When she says her back, does she really
mean HER back?! Like, the other side of her
body?!)"	
Message	Shido	"Um, I couldn't hear you well, Miku. Did you
say bath soap or something?"	
Message	Miku	"How could you mistake back with bath soap?
Come on, any day now."	
Message	None	"(With this, Miku gently pushed her hair away,
 exposing her back... I unblinkingly watched
the troublesome gesture. I was transfixed.)"	
Message	Miku	Will you, please～?	
Message	Shido	...Yes, gladly.	
Message	None	(Shoot, I answered unconsciously.)	
Message	Miku	Then, please do so～.	
Message	None	"(Miku waited while showing her back. If I
 make her wait too long, she might catch a
cold, so I guess I'll just have to steel myself.)"	
Message	Shido	"Alright, first I'll wash it with soap,
but let me know if something happens."	
Message	Miku	You're going to wash me with that sponge?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah.
Otherwise I can't get the soap to foam, right?"	
Message	Miku	"You could just use your hands to spread it on
me directly, you know～?"	
Message	Shido	"Gah, I couldn't possibly do that!
Just drop it, I'm going to start."	
Message	None	"(Oogh, she's so smooth. Anyway, I'll try to
wash her without shaking too much.)"	
Message	Miku	Aaaah. Darling, you're so intense...	
Message	Shido	"Hey, don't make any weird noises! I'm not
scrubbing that hard."	
Message	Miku	"The place you touched me is so very
hot, darling."	
Message	Shido	I'm washing you with hot water after all!	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee. You're very good at this. It's
unbelievably soothing."	
Message	None	"(Whew. All that's left is to rinse her off with
hot water. I did it. I fulfilled her request.)"	
Message	Shido	Miku, I'm going to rinse you with hot water.	
Message	Miku	Yes, please do.	
Message	None	"(Oogh. Miku's back, which was covered in soap,
is visible again... This is bad. I stared right
at it. Her flushed skin is so sexy.)"	
Message	None	(I-I can't handle this anymore... I... I—!)	
Message	Miku	Darling? What's the matter, darling?	
Message	Shido	Miku, I... I can't!	
Message	Miku	K-Kyaaaa...? Umm, umm, darling, darling?!	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I... can't do this.	
Message	None	"(My vision went red for a brief moment,
but darkness soon followed.)"	
Message	None	"(As I was losing consciousness, a beautiful
vision appeared before me.)"	
Message	Shido	"I never thought I'd get dizzy and pass out
from a bath in my own house..."	
Message	Miku	Um, I'm sorry. Darling, it was my fault.	
Message	Shido	"No, you're not at fault, Miku. I'm shocked
that I fainted. I wonder if I'm just tired..."	
Message	None	"(Or it's possible that seeing Miku's figure
in its natural state was too much to bear.)"	
Message	None	"(Good thing I laid out the futons ahead of
time. We planned to sleep together in the
living room.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry about everything, with you coming
here to stay over and whatnot..."	
Message	Miku	"Darling, I'm the one who should apologize.
I've made so many selfish requests."	
Message	Shido	Miku...	
Choice		But, I had fun.	
Choice		I'm sorry, myself.	
Message	Shido	But, I had fun.	
Message	Miku	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"I had fun. Just spending time with you, Miku.
So please don't apologize."	
Message	Miku	Darling...	
Message	Shido	Huh.	
Message	Miku	"Hee hee hee. Then, let me apologize in my
own sweet way."	
Message	Shido	Am I on your lap, Miku?	
Message	Miku	"Try not to move too much. You just fainted,
after all."	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	None	"(It's so soft, I might just pass out again,
but I'll keep that to myself.)"	
Message	Shido	I feel like I'm going to fall asleep...	
Message	Miku	Yes, that's all right. Just rest, darling.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	"(As I was drifting to sleep, something soft
touched against my forehead. Then, I was
overcome with happiness.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'm the one who should apologize. I'm a
disgrace."	
Message	Shido	"Fainting in the bathroom and being nursed
by my girlfriend. I can't believe it."	
Message	Miku	"That's not true at all. You have a terrific
personality, darling. A wonderful person. No
matter what anyone says, you're number one."	
Message	Shido	Miku, thank you...	
Message	Shido	"Well, I feel bad for saying this, but let's call
it a night. It's a little early. Is that okay with
you?"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, let's.
"	
Message	Miku	Um, darling...	
Message	Shido	Hm, what is it?	
Message	Miku	"Even after turning off the lights, can we
talk until we fall asleep?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course. To our heart's content.	
Message	None	"(And so, we stayed up for a long while,
sharing stories.)"
