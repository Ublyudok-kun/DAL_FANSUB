Message	Arusu	"Good grief. You made me wait quite a while.
But at long last, the time has come."	
Message	Shido	You're... Arusu? The other, black-clothed, Arusu.	
Message	Arusu	No no, I'm the *real* one.	
Message	Shido	So, the one who trapped us here is...	
Message	Arusu	"That wasn't me. The one who controls this world
is the girl, the one you call, "Maria"."	
Message	None	"(Arusu said this and pointed towards Maria, who
was curled into a ball.)"	
Message	Shido	What does that mean?	
Message	Arusu	"Too bad, though. Now I've become the controller.
I have been waiting. Watching your ridiculous
farce, all for this girl to learn what love is."	
Message	Maria	...*pant, pant*.	
Message	Shido	Maria?! Are you okay?!	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Nothing serious happened to me. However,
there was an interference with the authority
controls, most of which were taken from me."	
Message	Arusu	But, wouldn't you call it an equivalent exchange?	
Message	Shido	Equivalent exchange...?	
Message	Arusu	"Well, I am the one who gave this girl everything.
Her voice, her body... The information with which
she operates. Otherwise, she wouldn't exist."	
Message	Maria	"I did not always exist in this world...? Are you
saying I was created from you, an irregularity?"	
Message	Arusu	"That's right. Well, all things considered, it was
not intentional. You were created through a
distortion in this world. That is the truth."	
Message	Shido	Wha...?	
Message	Arusu	"Not that you need to worry or anything, but...
Something concerning had happened."	
Message	Shido	Something concerning?	
Message	Arusu	"Right. The moment I infiltrated this world, a
strong firewall was put around the Fraxinus'
main computer, trapping me in this world."	
Message	Shido	Trapped?	
Message	Arusu	"Yes. For a long time, I could not escape.
However, Shido Itsuka, you solved that problem
for me. You freed us from this world!"	
Message	Arusu	"But I no longer need this girl, nor you.
You are free to vanish alongside her!"	
Message	Shido	Arusu...! You can't be serious!	
Message	Arusu	"Don't call me by her name! I have my
own name, my actual name... Marina Arusu.
The name my father bestowed to me!"	
Message	Shido	Marina... That's your name?	
Message	Marina	"That's right. You'll no longer confuse us, right?
She and I are completely different people, and
I am the original."	
Message	Marina	"I've wasted too much time here. There's no
need for me to take care of you. Farewell."	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait a second! Did you think I'd just let
you monologue then walk away?!"	
Message	Marina	Too bad for you.	
Message	Shido	Wha...! My body... I can't move!	
Message	Shido	Damn it. She left... Maria, are you okay?	
Message	Maria	"...*pant...pant...* There is something affecting
my powers..."	
Message	None	"(Maria was sat down, taking pained, heavy
breaths. This is the work of the black-clothed
Arusu... Marina.)"	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, can you hear me?"	
Message	Shido	This voice... Reine-san?!	
Message	Reine	"Goodness. At last we make contact, just\nwhen the situation's taken a turn."	
Message	Shido	"Reine-san! It's an emergency! There are
two Arusus, and the black-clothed one has
taken control of this world!"	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, calm down. We saw everything from\nthe outside. Perhaps I should explain?"	
Message	Shido	Yes... Please.	
Message	Reine	"...Then, I'll explain. From the beginning,\nour hypothesis was flawed."	
Message	Reine	"The Artificial Spirit is the cause of this whole\ndebacle. It was not the white-clothed Arusu,\nbut the black-clothed one, Marina Arusu."	
Message	Shido	"I kinda got that from what she told me. So,
about the world disappearing..."	
Message	Reine	"Yes. The world has been seized by Marina Arusu.\nHowever, that's not all. She's entered our main\ncomputer, and seized control of the Fraxinus."	
Message	Shido	"Seized control of the Fraxinus?! Does that
mean Ratatoskr can't control it?!"	
Message	Reine	"Kannazuki is doing his best, but it is proving\nhard to recover. Our firewalls once protected\nus, but have now become our biggest obstacle."	
Message	Shido	That means, nothing can be done right now?	
Message	Reine	"Unfortunately, that seems to be the case.\nWe are exploring all available options, but\nwe're limited. The ship can't move, after all."	
Message	Shido	Then, what can we do...?	
Message	Reine	"...Stop the Artificial Spirit inside of the\ndigital world. Most likely, there is no\nother way."	
Message	Shido	"Which means defeating Marina... But if she can
do whatever she pleases, how can we stop her?"	
Message	Maria	...There is... a way.	
Message	Shido	Maria?! Are you able to move?	
Message	Maria	"Because 90% of the Fraxinus' mainframe has been
seized, I separated myself from the system. This
way, I can avoid Marina Arusu's influence."	
Message	Shido	I don't really follow, but I'm happy you're okay.	
Message	Maria	Yes. I apologize for worrying you.	
Message	Maria	"However, what has happened is all my
responsibility. Had I not fallen into this state,
everything could have been avoided."	
Message	Shido	That's not true! None of this is your fault.	
Message	Maria	"It is. This all started because I was unable
to counter Marina Arusu's initial attack."	
Message	Shido	"An attack from Marina? Like, a cyber-attack
on the Fraxinus? But then, if Marina is the
controller, how is that connect—"	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, your hypothesis is incorrect."	
Message	Shido	Reine-san? What do you mean?	
Message	None	"(Immediately after asking, I caught onto
a vague feeling of discomfort.)"	
Message	None	"(We had thought Maria was an AI Spirit,
an irregularity from the outside. We helped
her on her mission to learn what love is.)"	
Message	None	"(However, that whole premise was wrong.
The irregularity in this world wasn't Maria.
It was the black-clothed Arusu: Marina.)"	
Message	None	(If that were the case, one doubt remained.)	
Message	None	"(The girl in front of me... Maria Arusu,
who is she?!)"	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, remain calm and listen. The girl\nin front of you is most likely... the Fraxinus'\ncontrol AI."	
Message	Shido	WHA?!	
Message	Shido	Maria is... the Fraxinus' AI?!	
Message	None	"(Ratatoskr's aerial ship, the Fraxinus, is
equipped with a highly-advanced AI, or so
Kotori and Reine-san had told me.)"	
Message	None	"(Of course. It regulated the ships controls.
When I went on dates, it would present me with
choices. It observed the Spirits and me closely.)"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. When control was seized, because of the
open lock, all information was disclosed. I am
the ship's AI. You could say I am the Fraxinus."	
Message	Reine	"...Because of Marina Arusu's attack, some of\nthe Fraxinus' protections were destroyed. It\nwas then that Marina Arusu entered."	
Message	Reine	"...However, the AI trapped Marina Arusu into\na strongly-protected field, i.e. this virtually-\nsimulated reality system."	
Message	Reine	"...Everything else from then on is as Marina\nArusu said. Because of the attack, a being called\nMaria awakened in the AI, with locked memories."	
Message	Reine	"This is only speculation, but... most likely,\nshe was spawned to combat this unknown\nfoe. Thus, Maria was brought to life."	
Message	Shido	"Then how do you explain Maria's quest to
understand love? Marina suggested she was
freed because Maria had obtained emotion."	
Message	Reine	"...When her memories were locked by the\nsystem, her operating system's default function,\nto 'foster love', is all that remained, or..."	
Message	Shido	Or...?	
Message	Reine	"...There could be another cause. The Fraxinus\nAI's primary function is to support you in your\nquest to date the Spirits."	
Message	Reine	"It tracks the Spirits' mental states, and\noffers choices. One could say the Fraxinus\nAI was born to nurture love."	
Message	Shido	Born... to nurture love.	
Message	Reine	"Yes. That is most likely why Arusu wished\nto learn the meaning of love."	
Message	Reine	"...In truth, it's likely that the source of her\naspirations was one person. None other\nthan you."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Reine	"However, this ended up becoming a huge\nweakness."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I had been subconsciously running the
Fraxinus' protections. However, there is only
one way to release them."	
Message	Reine	"...Yes, that was by attracting the AI's heart.\nIn other words, it was her becoming more\nhuman."	
Message	Shido	Becoming... more human.	
Message	Maria	"However, it was a double-edged sword. When
I let my guard down, becoming defenseless,
I accidentally relinquished those protections."	
Message	Shido	"Then, this isn't your fault or responsibility.
I'm at fault, too!"	
Message	Maria	"No, it is my responsibility. There were surely
other ways to return you home. Even so, I gave
into my desires, and never sought them. Blame me."	
Message	Shido	I can't accept that!	
Message	Maria	"Whether or not you can matters not! That is
the truth!"	
Message	Reine	"...Both of you, you do not have the time to\nbicker. The situation is worsening as we\nspeak."	
Message	Shido	"Situation is worsening? What is Marina
doing...?"	
Message	Reine	"I previously thought her target was Ratatoskr's\ninformation and technology. However, it seems\nto be a simpler harassment."	
Message	Shido	A simpler harassment...?	
Message	Reine	"Just a moment ago, the Fraxinus' main cannon\nstarted up. It hasn't fully charged yet, but it\nhas the capability to wipe out an entire city."	
Message	Shido	"The Fraxinus' main cannon?! If she does that,
there's no telling what could happen..."	
Message	Reine	"It would no doubt ripple around the world.\nTo be honest, it is unfathomable."	
Message	Shido	Is there any way we can stop her?	
Message	Reine	"Just to be upfront, it is quite difficult. Even\nso, there's no other way. We must do it.\nListen, Shin. The only way, is to..."
