Message	None	(It's lunch time...)	
Message	None	"(Maria listened to the rest of the lecture
quietly, and the morning faded into noon
like a fog.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Time for luncheon.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you're right. Now that I think about
it, though..."	
Message	None	"(Because I didn't make breakfast today,
I also didn't prepare myself a bento for
lunch!)"	
Message	Tohka	What is the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Tohka... There's no bento for today.	
Message	Tohka	"I-Is that so? Could that be because of the
virtual world we are currently inside of?"	
Message	Shido	"That might have something to do with it,
but... Well, it's a long story."	
Message	Shido	"No. Wait a sec. Hey, Maria. You didn't happen
to make a bento, did you?"	
Message	Maria	"Unfortunately, all I made was breakfast.
I did not prepare any bento."	
Message	Shido	"I figured as much. It didn't seem like you packed
any bento."	
Message	Maria	"If we have no bento, then I have a proposal.
What if we were to visit the school store today?"	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh, the school store! If that's the case, I
wish to eat kinako bread, but it's hard to
resist yakisoba bread or coronets. Hmm..."	
Message	Origami	"You're so naïve, Tohka Yatogami. You don't know
how much demand there is for kinako bread.
It sells out in no time. The battle has begun."	
Message	Tohka	Wha?! That's not fair, Origami Tobiichi!	
Message	Shido	Good grief...	
Message	Kurumi	Hee hee. Such a noisy bunch.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, are you not going over too?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Please don't worry for my sake. There
is no reason to rush myself."	
Message	Shido	Gotcha. Then Maria, we'd better...	
Message	Maria	No. There is no need.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	There aren't... many people, surprisingly.	
Message	Kotori	Heeey, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	Kotori. You changed your ribbons.	
Message	Kotori	"What are you talking about? This is what
I normally wear to school."	
Message	None	"(Hm? Right. Duh. There's no need for her to
act like a commander when she's at school.)"	
Message	Miku	Oh. You came to the school store too, darling?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, just today. This is your and Kotori's first
time here, isn't it?"	
Message	Miku	"That's right. My first time, but it's not as busy
as I have been led to believe it is."	
Message	Shido	No. It's usually way more crowded than this.	
Message	Kaguya	"Heh. It seems they were intimidated by the
presence of we Yamais, scattering elsewhere."	
Message	Shido	I doubt that's why...	
Message	Yuzuru	"Question. Why is the canteen so empty?
Though I cannot complain, for we were
able to purchase bread easily."	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, the cafeteria was empty. I bought enough
bread for you, so hurry up and eat."	
Message	Origami	"I bought bread for Shido. He should eat mine
instead of whatever you bought, Tohka Yatogami."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"OH! I just thought of somethin' good!\nBefore Shido-kun eats the bread, you should\nput it in your clothes to warm it up for him."	
Message	Shido	"You're here too, Yoshino. Which means, wait?
The only people here are ones who aren't
NPCs."	
Message	Origami	"It's unusual that no one else is here. Maybe
it's a system error of some kind?"	
Message	Shido	If that's the case, then Maria would... Hmm?	
Message	None	"(Glancing over, I see Maria walking up,
clutching loaves of bread in both arms.)"	
Message	Maria	"I have purchased bread from the school store.
This rabbit-shaped bread is interesting."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ooh. Those rabbit ones are a good choice."	
Message	Maria	This part, with the red eyes, is unusual.	
Message	Kurumi	Those are cherries, Arusu-san.	
Message	Maria	I see. The fruit of a prunus avium tree.	
Message	Shido	Wait a moment, Maria.	
Message	Maria	What is the matter?	
Message	Shido	"You mentioned before that we didn't need to
rush. You didn't... ward everyone away from the
store, did you?"	
Message	Maria	Just enough... so that we would not be troubled.	
Message	Shido	So you did!	
Message	Maria	Yes. Otherwise, we would miss our lunches.	
Message	Shido	"Well, that might be true, but didn't you say
this morning that you'd keep life as normal
as possible?"	
Message	Maria	I believe it is no different than usual.	
Message	Shido	I guess that makes sense... Or does it?	
Message	Maria	"Either way, no harm has been done.
Does this not qualify as "normal"?"	
Message	Shido	It's complicated.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, it might be related to Arusu-san's quest to
find love. I believe there is some correlation
between love and hunger."	
Message	Shido	I don't know if I believe that.	
Message	Miku	It's fine, isn't it, darling? Meals are important.	
Message	Shido	That's true. Then, everything's okay.	
Message	Maria	That is fine.	
Message	Shido	No, it's not!	
Message	Maria	But you just said it was okay...	
Message	Shido	"Err. Well, I did, but when we don't have any
reason to be at the school store, then make
sure you make everything normal again."	
Message	Maria	Yes. That is what I intended.	
Message	None	"(Maria seems to have become more thoughtful,
or maybe craftier? Either way, she's changed
a bit.)"	
Message	None	"(Hm? Has she started to change...? It's almost
like I've been watching over Maria's progress.
Why did I think of it that way?)"	
Message	None	"(After all was said and done, we finished lunch.
While it's hard to say afternoon classes went on
without incident, it was a pretty typical day.)"	
Message	Shido	"Whew. Classes are over. It was a lot noisier
than usual."	
Message	Shido	"But it was fun. Seems like you're getting
the hang of going to school, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Shido, with this, school is over, correct?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, and there are no clubs at our school.
It was a typical day, so maybe it wasn't that
interesting for you."	
Message	Maria	"No, today was interesting. But...
It was not enough."	
Message	Shido	Not enough? What wasn't enough?	
Message	Maria	Love.	
Message	Shido	It's true there wasn't much of that.	
Message	Maria	"In order to learn about love, is it not necessary
for me to take one further step?"	
Message	Shido	One further step?	
Message	Maria	"Shido, please answer honestly. And then,
can you show me?"	
Message	Shido	Show you... what?	
Message	Maria	"If you were to spend special time with
another... would you and that other person
be drawn to one another in the same way?"	
Message	Shido	What are you saying?	
Message	Maria	If you had to... would you choose me?	
Message	Shido	Maria...?	
Message	Maria	"Please choose, Shido. Will you teach me
the ways of love?"	
Message	Shido	I... Let's see...	
Message	None	"(If that's what Maria wants, and given that I
want to know about Maria, then my answer
is...)"
