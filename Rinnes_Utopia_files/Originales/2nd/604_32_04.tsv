Message	Shido	Ah.	
Message	Shido	Today is one fine day.	
Message	None	"(The weather was nice where I stood in front of Tengu
Station. This was where we were going to meet up.)"	
Message	Shido	We were supposed to meet at Pachiko, right?	
Message	None	"(I looked around the area before spotting Kurumi. She
seemed cheerful as she looked around herself.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, there she is. Heeey, Kurumi!	
Message	None	"(Kurumi noticed me and smiled. She waved as I made my
way toward her.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I thought I was on time... Did I make you wait?	
Message	Kurumi	No. I just got here a little while ago.	
Message	Shido	I see. I'm glad.	
Message	None	"(I feel like I've had this interaction before. That's
right―I'm on another date with Kurumi today.)"	
Message	Shido	Um...	
Message	Kurumi	...What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, are you thinking about my swimsuit?	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe. Don't worry. I did bring the swimsuit you
chose for me the other day."	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not it!	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, I can't believe you would choose such a
swimsuit... I certainly underestimated you."	
Message	Shido	Huh?! I chose a normal swimsuit, right?! Right?!	
Message	Kurumi	Of course. I was only kidding.	
Message	Shido	I-I thought so.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi giggled. It seems like she's been playing with
me from the get-go.)"	
Message	Shido	Gosh, give me a break...	
Message	Kurumi	I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess I'm not too bothered.	
Message	Kurumi	So, Shido-san. Please lead the way.	
Message	Shido	Got it. Let's go, Kurumi.	
Message	None	"(I took Kurumi's hand. She graciously followed after
me, and that made me a little happy.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. I can't wait to go to Ocean Park.	
Message	None	"(Ocean Park was a water park that we decided to visit
a long time ago. Kurumi and I walked together toward
Tengu Station.)"	
Message	None	"(I got out of the locker room and looked for Kurumi.
It seemed like she was still changing.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi's not out yet...	
Message	Shido	Anyways, time to go over the plan!	
Message	None	"(I've been to Ocean Park before. Today, I'm going to
use the experience I have to show Kurumi a good time.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi usually leads the way...	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm first going to take her hand and bring her to
the pool."	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm her boyfriend... so I can at least hold her
hand, right?"	
Message	Shido	All right, I'm going to impress her today!	
Message	None	(Or so I thought...)	
Message	Shido	...Um, what am I supposed to do in this situation?	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, take this.	
Message	Shido	Th-This?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi handed me a bottle of sunscreen. Th-This
means...)"	
Message	Shido	U-Um, Kurumi-san?	
Message	Shido	What do you want me... to do with this sunscreen?	
Message	Kurumi	It's obvious. You're going to put this on me, right?	
Message	Shido	What...?!	
Message	Kurumi	"I mean, there are hard-to-reach areas. I'd love my
boyfriend to put it on me..."	
Message	Shido	Well, but... Touching your skin directly...	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san. I won't be embarrassed, no matter where
you touch me."	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	Come on, pre-tty please...	
Message	None	(I...)	
Choice		Do as she asks and put sunscreen on her	
Choice		Might as well have her undo the top part	
Message	None	"(I succumbed to the temptation of Kurumi's smooth,
porcelain skin... And took the sunscreen from her.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...I'm glad you're willing.	
Message	Kurumi	Please start with my back.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Something the matter?	
Message	Shido	N-No, nothing at all!	
Message	Kurumi	Then, if you would please.	
Message	Shido	G-Got it.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi's fair skin was extremely bright. Seeing her
like this, I felt all levels of self-restraint leave
me.)"	
Message	None	"(I tried as much as possible not to look at her body
as I rubbed the sunscreen on her.)"	
Message	Shido	L-Like this?	
Message	Kurumi	...?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa. S-Sorry! Did I touch someplace weird?	
Message	Kurumi	No. It felt so good...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Please go lower.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	Mmmm.	
Message	Kurumi	Auuuu.	
Message	Kurumi	AHHHH.	
Message	None	"(Every time I put my fingers on her, deep sighs
escaped her mouth.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi... Um, are you okay?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. You're very good, Shido-san.	
Message	Kurumi	Don't mind me. Please continue.	
Message	None	(But it makes me feel weird...)	
Message	Kurumi	Next... Please work from my hips to my legs.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?! I'm going to do those areas, too?	
Message	Kurumi	...You don't want to?	
Message	Shido	Well, that's not it, but―!	
Message	None	"(B-But as a healthy male, any more than this will be
painful..)"	
Message	Kurumi	Don't be shy... Please continue.	
Message	Kurumi	Now... Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	*whimper*...	
Message	None	"(I ended up rubbing all of the sunscreen on her until
the end, just as she requested.)"	
Message	None	"(I didn't want to just do everything she asked, so I
decided to trouble her a little.)"	
Message	Shido	...Okay, fine. I'll put it on you.	
Message	Kurumi	...I'm glad you're willing.	
Message	Kurumi	Could you please start from my back?	
Message	Shido	"Th-That's fine with me, but won't the swimsuit strings
be in the way?"	
Message	Kurumi	...What?	
Message	Shido	"I-I might as well put it on evenly, right? Then you
need to undo the back―"	
Message	Kurumi	...I see.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi gave me a bewitching stare, and I came back
down to earth. I guess I went too far.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi. I was only kidd―	
Message	Kurumi	Okay, then.	
Message	Shido	...What?!	
Message	Kurumi	Hold on a moment.	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... I'm getting ready right now.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi reached back to undo the top of her swimsuit,
revealing her pale skin in its entirety.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Now... Shido-san, if you would please.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"(Seeing Kurumi's alluring back, I couldn't help but
gulp.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe... I get to feel your hands on me. I must be
really lucky."	
Message	None	"(I can't back down now. I put the sunscreen on her and
began to spread it across her back.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Mmm... Haaah.	
Message	Kurumi	You're really good, Shido-san... Please continue.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kurumi	Uummm.	
Message	Kurumi	Mmmmm.	
Message	Kurumi	HAAAAAH...	
Message	None	"(Every time I moved my hands, Kurumi's body jolted
and quivered, and she made noises that boiled all the
liquid from my head.)"	
Message	Kurumi	My... What's the matter, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	You're making too many noises...!	
Message	Kurumi	Well, that's because you're touching me in that way.	
Message	Shido	I-It's my fault...?	
Message	Kurumi	"That's right. It's because your hands feel so nice.
Please continue... until you're finished."	
Message	Kurumi	"If that's not enough for you... Then after you've
finished on my back, maybe you can work on my
front?"	
Message	Shido	What...	
Message	Shido	N-No. Give me a break!	
Message	None	(I don't think I'll be able to restrain myself...)	
Message	Kurumi	"That's unfortunate. Where's the Shido-san who said
he wanted to enjoy Kurumi's skin more..."	
Message	Shido	I NEVER SAID THAT! NOT A SINGLE WORD!	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Very well. I guess I'll just take the front,
then."	
Message	Shido	Oh I see... Hey wait! That's wrong! Just the back!	
Message	Kurumi	"Gosh, Shido-san. You're such a shy boy... So...
Please take care of the rest."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(In the end, I put the sunscreen on as she asked.)	
Message	None	"(We ended up playing at Ocean Park until the evening
and went home afterwards.)"	
Message	Shido	*sigh*... We did a lot today.	
Message	None	"(It was my first time going to the pool with Kurumi.
Despite the sunscreen situation, I feel like I played
too hard.)"	
Message	None	(I was so tired when we went to take the bus back.)	
Message	None	"(Kurumi and I sat next to one another at the bus stop
in front of the station, waiting for the bus to arrive.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh yeah... Why don't we schedule our next date?
Kurumi, when do you want to go? ...Kurumi?"	
Message	Kurumi	...Zzz.	
Message	Shido	...Kurumi?	
Message	None	"(Kurumi had closed her eyes and fallen asleep. I
couldn't help but smile because she looked so
adorable. Something I rarely got to see.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, we did move around a lot today...	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What is it, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Mmmm...	
Message	Shido	She's sleep-talking...	
Message	Kurumi	...Forever...	
Message	Kurumi	...I want to be with you forever...	
Message	None	(I decided to watch her sleep until the bus came.)	
Message	None	"(She had carelessly left her hand out, so I softly
held it in mine.)"
