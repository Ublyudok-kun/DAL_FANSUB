Message	None	<<No event data for today!>>	
Message	Ai	We found you, Itsuka-kun!	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Mai	"Wandering around with the intent to seduce
someone again, are you?!"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? What?
I-I don't understand what you're saying at all..."	
Message	Mii	"Even though you have someone like Tohka-chan,
using your amorous gaze on other women is
unforgivable!"	
Message	Ai	That’s right, you enemy of women!	
Message	Mai	Pig slop!	
Message	Mii	May the gods strike you down!	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, wait. I don't know what you're upset
about!"	
Message	Mii	Then hurry, and return to Tohka-chan's side...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is up with you guys...?	
Message	Shido	Urgh, what's over there?!	
Message	Ai	...Target, spotted!	
Message	Mai	Enemy ship sighted! Heave ho!	
Message	Mii	We won't let you escape, Shido Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait just a moment. Why are you making me
out to be the enemy?"	
Message	Mii	"Together, we have formed the "Itsuka
Observation Division" to make sure you don't
cheat on Tohka-chan, for her sake!"	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! Hey, wait. Couldn't you have picked
a less incriminating name...?"	
Message	Ai	"Be quiet! Listen carefully, Shido Itsuka!
Should a wicked thought enter your heart,
we will bring down the hammer of justice!"	
Message	Shido	Whatever you say! I'll be going now!	
Message	Mai	Ah, wait! Dang it!	
Message	Mii	Don't let him escape! After him!	
Message	Shido	Hyeeeeeek!! Why are you following me?!	
Message	Shido	...!! That's—!	
Message	Ai	"Curse you, Shido Itsuka! To think he would
escape being trapped by the "Itsuka Observation
Team"!"	
Message	Mii	"We have to hurry and find him, or that wild beast
will sink his poisonous fangs into yet another
victim!"	
Message	Mai	"Find him! We have to find him as quickly as
possible!"	
Message	Shido	It's them, again.	
Message	None	"(Like hell I'm gonna be found.
I'll hide and let them pass...)"	
Message	Ai	Too bad, we lost sight of him.	
Message	Mii	"Is he trying to make Tohka-chan cry again,
that bastard?"	
Message	Mai	Poor Tohka-chan...	
Message	Ai	"You know, when I think about it, we're quite
the faithful bunch, aren't we?"	
Message	Mai	"You might be right. Without even considering
ourselves, we merely pray for Tohka-chan's
happiness..."	
Message	Mii	"We sacrifice ourselves in the name of another's
romance. Ohhh, what steadfast, otome hearts
we have!"	
Message	Ai	We are so. Totally. Heroic...	
Message	None	(Yeah. I'm getting out of here...)	
Message	Mii	We've found you, Shido Itsukaaaa!	
Message	Shido	Gah, you guys again!	
Message	Ai	There's nowhere to escape, you cheating jerk!	
Message	Shido	Oogh, cheating jerk, you guys...	
Message	Mai	...Now, you'll accept this present from us.	
Message	Shido	Present...?	
Message	Ai	"That's right. For Tohka-chan's sake, I got a pair
of admission tickets for the Tengu Tower
observation deck."	
Message	Shido	I-I don't need your help!	
Message	Mii	"Rrrgh, stop struggling! Use these tickets to
invite Tohka-chan on a date!"	
Message	Shido	"L-Let go of me!
I-I can invite her on a date myself!"	
Message	Ai	...Huh?	
Message	Mai	What did you just say...?	
Message	Mii	"You were going to invite Tohka-chan to a date
on your own...?"	
Message	Ai	So our earnestness got through to you?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well. I'm not sure if I was going to ask
out Tohka today..."	
Message	Mai	What did you say?!	
Message	Mii	So you really are a rotten Lothario character!	
Message	Ai	I knew it! Divine punishment is necessary!	
Message	Shido	Aaack, stooop!	
Message	Mai	Wait, Shido Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	...You three again!	
Message	Ai	Today of all days, you won't escape!	
Message	Mii	We won't forgive a playboy jackass like you!	
Message	Shido	"Playboy jackass... I have no idea what you're
talking about, you know!"	
Message	Ai	"Don't play dumb! You were dating a girl
from another school!"	
Message	Shido	I-I don't know anything about that!	
Message	Mai	"No no, I heard that you were spotted walking into
a hotel with an older, beautiful office lady!"	
Message	Shido	Th-That's a false accusation!	
Message	Mii	"I saw him leading a young looking girl by the
hand around back!"	
Message	Shido	That'd be a straight up felony!	
Message	Ai	"That's right, you lolicon bastard! We'll cut you
down here!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait a second! Do you have proof of that?!
I don't have memory of any of those things,
when was this?!"	
Message	Ai, Mai, Mii	Yesterday!	
Message	Shido	...Excuse me?	
Message	Ai, Mai, Mii	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	"What are you saying? There's only one of me,
you know? There's no way I could go on so many
dates at once, in one day!"	
Message	Ai	...That's super weird, am I misremembering?	
Message	Mai	"...Now that you say it, my memory
does feel sort of hazy..."	
Message	Mii	Could it be, some illusion of youth...?	
Message	None	"(All right. I'll use this time to get away. Until
then, you keep pondering amongst yourselves!)"	
Message	Ai, Mai, Mii	Hmmmmm...
