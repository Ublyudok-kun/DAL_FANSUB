Message	None	(All right, I'll invite Tohka out on a date.)	
Message	None	"(It's a bit embarrassing to do it in the
classroom, so I'll just wait for her here.)"	
Message	None	"(Hm... huh?! I thought she was just taking a while
to come out, but she's not even in there!)"	
Message	None	"(Where did she go? It hasn't gotten that late,
right? I guess I'll go look for her.)"	
Message	None	"(Hmmm... She's not here. Is it possible she's also
looking for me, and we keep passing
each other...?)"	
Message	None	(I'll try going back...)	
Message	None	"(I guess she really isn't here... *sigh...*
Where did she go? Did she head home first?)"	
Message	None	(I'll search a little more before going home.)	
Message	None	(Hm? Over there... It's Tohka! Isn't it?)	
Message	None	"(Huh... She's with the Ai Mai Mii trio. What are
they doing gathered around Tohka like that?)"	
Message	None	"(It somehow feels difficult to approach them...
I guess I'll watch them from here...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm... Then, you were able to procure it?	
Message	Ai	"There's been no mistake.
I brought it here with me."	
Message	Mai	"Ai, you do great work. This is absolutely
necessary for Tohka-chan's path to otome bliss."	
Message	Mii	This is seriously overkill.	
Message	Ai	"Oh, Tohka-chan, I understand being impatient about
everything, but you'd better be careful to not let
the target know."	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes!	
Message	Mai	"That's right! If you're going to perfect your
womanliness, it has to be casually! This is
an eternal theme!"	
Message	Mii	"Staying too long's dangerous. Just hurry the hell
up and hand it over. It'll be a pain
if we're seen."	
Message	Ai	"Right. Tohka-chan, it'll be hard to pull
everything off, but the feature article's
sure to help. Do your best!"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Thank you very much for your help!	
Message	Ai	Hehe, no need to be all formal with us!	
Message	Mai	Tohka-chan! Fight! Fight!	
Message	Mii	"We're all behind you, Tohka-chan.
If you ever have any trouble, just let us know.
We'll hire The Cleaners to take care of it."	
Message	Ai	"Right, let's shove off! Let us know if there's any
progress. See ya!"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Looks like they're done.	
Message	Shido	―Shoot, they saw me!	
Message	Ai	"Well, hello there, Itsuka-kun. What's a nice guy
like you doing in a place like this? Are you
sneaking around, stalking Tohka-chan?"	
Message	None	(I can't think of a good excuse.)	
Message	Mai	"How long have you been here?
You weren't watching this whole time, were you?"	
Message	Shido	"I-I just happened to be passing by! I'm not
stalking anyone!"	
Message	Mii	"If that's the truth, then fine. But if you're
lying, you'll end up floating in the Caspian Sea."	
Message	None	"(Coming from her, it really doesn't
sound like a joke...)"	
Message	Tohka	Heeeey! Shidoooo!	
Message	Ai	Ah! The arrival of the princess!	
Message	Mai	We should break contact and withdraw! Withdraw!	
Message	Mii	Do you want to live a long life?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Um, yes...	
Message	Mii	Then don't make Tohka-chan cry.	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Tohka	Shido! What are you doing here?	
Message	Shido	"E-Er, I was looking for you because I wanted
to invite you—"	
Message	Tohka	I-I see! A date, is it?!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... This calls for immediate use of my special
item!"	
Message	Shido	"Hm, what's wrong? Do you have
something else to do?"	
Message	Tohka	"N-No, I'm fine! I'm fine, b-but
please wait a moment."	
Message	Shido	What is she going to do...?	
Message	Tohka	Ohh, this is it!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... "Summer's kicking off to a hot start, and
beautiful bimbos with rockin' bods have the upper
hand!" ...No, that doesn't seem right..."	
Message	Tohka	"...Hm? "Unlock the secrets to his desire! In this
step-by-step guide, you'll learn how you can
pull your bad boy in by the―" ...No, no!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm? The feature article! This is it!	
Message	Tohka	"Let me see... "Feminine Date Ideas
for Elegant Ladies"... Ohh... hmm... I see..."	
Message	Tohka	...All right! I shall go with this!	
Message	None	"(I can hear her mumbling from the other side of
the building... What is she doing?)"	
Message	Tohka	I apologize, Shido! I kept you waiting!	
Message	Shido	Oh, are you all good?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! Although, I did not have time
to learn everything..."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	I-I-It is nothing! L-Let us hurry on our date!	
Message	Shido	All right, then. Where should we go today?	
Message	Tohka	Over here, Shido! Follow me!	
Message	Shido	Wha―? H-Hey, Tohka! Wait up!	
Message	Shido	"Ummm...Tohka-san? We seem to be back at my
house... What happened to our date?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, this is our date!	
Message	Shido	"Ohh, I see. You came back home to change... So,
where would you like to go after that?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm? We will not be going anywhere...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	Y-You can just sit and wait right here, Shido!	
Message	Shido	H-Here...?	
Message	Tohka	"Hmmm... Eggs, eggs, where are the eggs?! Ohh!
Here they are!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm, a bowl and... measuring spoons. Where are
they? ―Here! No. Then, here! They're not here...!
Then... what about here?!"	
Message	Tohka	Augh!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?! Are you okay??	
Message	Tohka	Y-You can't!	
Message	None	"(As I tried to rush into the kitchen, Tohka stood
steadfastly in front of me.)"	
Message	Shido	Wha―!	
Message	Tohka	"You have to sit over there, Shido!
Men are not allowed in the kitchen!"	
Message	Shido	A-All right...	
Message	None	"(That's super old-fashioned, but... Well, she
seems to be trying to cook something on her own.
If Tohka is insisting, I guess I'll wait here...)"	
Message	Tohka	"*Cough, cough!*
...Rgh! I can't see anymore!"	
Message	None	"(Wh-What the heck? A powdery, white cloud
is drifting into the living room...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Ah! It's no good! I've forgotten to put in the
eggs and the milk!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm?! Oh, shoot! The floor's slippery now...
This is a disaster!"	
Message	Tohka	"Curse you, milk! How dare you show me such
impudence?!"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh?! I was supposed to add in the egg first?
Hmph! It isn't too late to add it now!"	
Message	Tohka	"N-No good! Can I not use this anymore?
Hm... It can't be helped, I'll simply use a new―"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph! Curse you! You're so slippery! Then I shall
do this all at once―"	
Message	Tohka	Ah! Grrrrrr...!	
Message	None	"(Ummm, can I still not go in?
It's probably not okay...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hah! Then I'll just leave eggs out! It'll be fine
if I have milk!"	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh... What about that thing? I haven't used the
"ding"-ing object yet!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmmm, anyone can microwave whipping cream...
Even the clumsiest among us can heat it up and be
a proper pâtissière! Yes, this is it!"	
Message	Tohka	"Now then, in the meantime,
I'll heat up the frying pan..."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm?! What the―? The microwave!	
Message	None	"(Whoa! That was pretty loud just now. I think it
might be a good time for me to step in
and help...)"	
Message	None	"(N-No, wait! I should believe in Tohka, and wait
for her until the end.)"	
Message	None	"(I want to respect Tohka's feelings, and she did
did tell me to wait here... Hmmm, what should
I do...?)"	
Choice		I'll go help her after all.	
Choice		I'll believe in Tohka and wait.	
Message	Shido	A-Are you all right, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido?! I told you you can't come in here!	
Message	Shido	"After hearing such a huge noise, of course I'd be
be worried; I can't just sit still..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm...	
Message	Shido	Whoa... This is quite the mess...	
Message	Tohka	I-It wasn't supposed to end up like this!	
Message	Shido	"All right. I'll help too, so let's
make it together!"	
Message	Tohka	B-But...	
Message	Shido	"Cooking and eating together is a perfectly
good date, isn't it?"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...	
Message	Shido	Now, then... What were you trying to make?	
Message	Tohka	H-Hot cakes.	
Message	Shido	"Ooh, that's pretty good. It's already a bit past
3, but hot cakes shouldn't take so long... And the
ingredients... Yeah, we should be able to do it."	
Message	Tohka	I apologize...	
Message	Shido	Don't look so sad.	
Message	Shido	"If you tried your hardest and it didn't work out,
just make the best of it. Don't let it get to you.
You're better than people who don't try at all."	
Message	Tohka	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	"Seeing you throw your all into this challenge
makes me realize exactly how amazing you are."	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	Shido	"So, Tohka... Because of you, I end up wanting
to help out in any way that I can."	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"All right, we'd better hurry and make it so we can
eat soon, or else we won't have enough room for
dinner!"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes!	
Message	None	"(We hurriedly cleaned the kitchen and made
some hot cakes while debating over different
cooking methods.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh! Cooked for just the right amount of time,
with plenty of butter and honey! And the inside is
so fluffy! You are a genius at hot cakes, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	"Haha, you're exaggerating. But I'm glad they came
out so well."	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	Shido	"You'll be able to make them by
yourself next time, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Mm... Y-Yes, you're right.	
Message	None	"(Huh? Everything seemed to be going so well, but
Tohka's face got dark all of a sudden. Did I say
something wrong again?)"	
Message	Tohka	"This wasn't supposed to happen... I have to make
them for Shido myself..."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's wrong, Tohka...? Oh, was it a little
burnt underneath?"	
Message	Tohka	I-It's nothing! Thank you for the hot cakes...	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	Hmmm. I can't seem to understand a girl's heart...	
Message	None	"Well, I waited this long. I'll try trusting
her until the end..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm, the inside of the microwave is... Well, it's
so cloudy, I can't see anything."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph...! It's fine! Even without whipping cream!
Butter and honey will do!"	
Message	Tohka	"All right, just a little more... A feminine woman
works hard in the kitchen!"	
Message	Tohka	"Heat up the frying pan... How long
does it need to be heated?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm... it should probably be hot by now...?	
Message	Tohka	―Ouch!	
Message	Shido	―?!	
Message	None	(Aaaah, jeez! I can't wait anymore!)	
Message	Shido	―Tohka! Are you okay?!	
Message	Tohka	...Sh-Shido?	
Message	Shido	Are you hurt?	
Message	Tohka	"I-I am fine, but... It wasn't supposed to be
this way! I can't have you eat this..."	
Message	Shido	"Whoa... This is quite the mess. But if you're all
right, Tohka, then it's fine. You can always try
cooking again another time."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...	
Message	Shido	"For now, let's clean this up... And then why
don't we make it again together?"	
Message	Tohka	B-But...	
Message	Shido	"Cooking and eating together is a perfectly
good date, isn't it?"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...	
Message	Shido	Here, first wipe your face with this...	
Message	Shido	Now then... What were you trying to make?	
Message	Tohka	H-Hot cakes.	
Message	Shido	"Ooh, that's pretty good. It's already a bit past
3, but hot cakes shouldn't take so long... And the
ingredients... Yeah, we should be able to do it."

Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"All right, we'd better hurry and make it so we can

Message	Tohka	Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	"I'd be happy to make them for
you whenever you want."	
Message	Tohka	Really?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah!	
Message	Tohka	No... It's no good like this...	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	None	"(Huh? Everything seemed to be going so well, but
Tohka's face got dark all of a sudden. Did I say
