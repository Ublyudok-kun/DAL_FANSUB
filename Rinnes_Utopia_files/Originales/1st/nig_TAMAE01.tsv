Message	Shido	Oh Tama-cha... err, I mean sensei. Goodbye!	
Message	Tamae	Oh... Itsuka-kun.	
Message	Shido	Yes... What is it?	
Message	Tamae	How are you feeling?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Sorry for worrying you.
I'm totally fine now."	
Message	Tamae	"I see. That's so good to hear. You seem to not be
focused on your studies lately, so I was worried
about you."	
Message	None	"(Oh. I was so busy with the Spirits and
everything... but even if I weren't busy,
I still don't see myself really studying...)"	
Message	Tamae	"I'm glad that you're feeling better now.
Please keep up with your studies, okay?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry... Huh? Sensei?	
Message	Tamae	Oh... M-My pictures!	
Message	Shido	I'm so sorry. Let me help you.	
Message	Tamae	Nooo, you can't touch them～!	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Tamae	I-I'll pick them up myself...	
Message	Shido	"S-Sensei... Are those... photos from a matchmaking
service...?"	
Message	Tamae	I... Th-They're not～!	
Message	None	"(But they're all photos of men in suits...
It's pretty obvious that they are...)"	
Message	Tamae	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tamae	Don't tell anyone... Okay?	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Tamae	Um... Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Oh, sensei. What is it...?	
Message	Tamae	Um... Well... Er... You see...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Tamae	"Um... Itsuka-kun? You know the other day, when you
were talking to a man...?"	
Message	Shido	A man...?	
Message	Tamae	"Yes... His hair was kind of long... He looked kind
of handsome, and seemed really bright..."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh... Could you be talking
about Kannazuki-san?"	
Message	Tamae	H-His name is Kannazuki-san...? So you know him?!	
Message	Shido	"Well I talk to him from time to time, but...
I guess I know him... uh... Yeah, I guess I do..."	
Message	Tamae	Is that so...!	
Message	Shido	—! No, sensei!	
Message	Tamae	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Don't. Anyone but him! I very seriously don't
recommend him for you!"	
Message	Tamae	U-Um... That wasn't what I meant～	
Message	Shido	Don't be fooled by his looks, sensei!	
Message	Tamae	...O-Okay.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Tama-ch... I mean sensei.	
Message	Tamae	Oh... Itsuka-kun.	
Message	Shido	What's the matter? You look so glum...	
Message	Tamae	"You see... I was just worried
about Tobiichi-san..."	
Message	Shido	Origami...?	
Message	Tamae	She seems so gloomy lately.	
Message	Shido	...Really?	
Message	Tamae	"Before, she was so energetic that every time
she'd see Yatogami-san, they'd get into some
heated argument... But lately, she's been so calm."	
Message	Shido	Y-You think so...?	
Message	None	(...I don't think she's holding back, though.)	
Message	Tamae	"When my students seem to be down, I get worried as
their teacher～"	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Tamae	"Why are you looking at me that way? Are you
thinking something like, ""Wow she acts like a
teacher sometimes, doesn't she?""	"	
Message	Shido	"""A-Ah... That's exactly right.
As expected of a teacher."	
Message	Tamae	Really, now. I am a teacher too, you know?!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes, I'm sorry.	
Message	Tamae	Oh... Itsuka-kun.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Hi, sensei.	
Message	Tamae	Are you going home today?	
Message	Shido	Yes, I have some things to take care of...	
Message	Tamae	Are you dropping by somewhere?	
Message	Shido	Oh... well... I may.	
Message	Tamae	"Come to think of it, have you been to the
Neo Tengu Tower yet?"	
Message	Shido	"Yes, just from the outside.
It's easy to see from afar."	
Message	Tamae	Right. That is our town's new symbol.	
Message	Shido	That's right. Haha.	
Message	Tamae	...!	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Is something wrong?	
Message	Tamae	"...I feel like I've had this conversation
with you before."	
Message	Shido	"About the tower? Well we've all been talking about
it a lot, but..."	
Message	Tamae	"No... That's not what I meant. Like I feel like I
had the same exact conversation with you, here,
at the same time..."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that...?	
Message	Tamae	Uh... Deja...	
Message	Shido	...Déjà vu?	
Message	Tamae	"Yes, yes... Something like that. I feel like I'm
seeing this over and over..."	
Message	Shido	Over and over...?	
Message	Tamae	"Oh... Don't worry about it.
Maybe I'm imagining things..."	
Message	Tamae	"Well, Itsuka-kun, be careful
on your way home, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Oh... Okay.
