Message	Tohka	I-Is this okay?	
Message	Reine	"Mm. All that's left is to get the towel and gently
wipe down his body."	
Message	Tohka	G-Gently, right?	
Message	None	"(Wh-What? What's going on?
I'm super self-conscious...)"	
Message	Reine	Now... Let's get his temperature, too.	
Message	Shido	What? Shouldn't it be afterwards...?	
Message	Reine	...Shin, open wide.	
Message	Shido	Huh? O-Okay... Ahh...	
Message	None	(Ah! Reine-san's cleavage is too close!)	
Message	None	"(I immediately looked away, and saw Tohka
moving the towel over my skin and blushing
furiously...)"	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(Every time Tohka moved the towel, it tickled my
body. I felt like I would make a weird sound at
any moment.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Sh-Shido! Are you okay?! I'm sorry, I may have
touched your old wounds."	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's not that—	
Message	Tohka	I-I know! I need to wash you more gently, right?	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Tohka	Ah! S-Sorry! Then... why don't I wipe you here?	
Message	Shido	N-No, not there...!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm, this place is weak, too... Shido, your whole
body is injured..."	
Message	Tohka	It's all my fault. Forgive me, Shido...	
Message	Shido	N-No! It's not like that. Don't worry.	
Message	Tohka	R-Really?! Then let me wipe you more—	
Message	Shido	N-No... Don't do it anym—?!	
Message	Reine	"Oh, Tohka... For your first time,
you're doing a good job."	
Message	Tohka	"R-Really?! It seems like it's good to keep the
body clean!"	
Message	Shido	*Pant*...*pant*... Th-Thanks, Tohka! I'm...	
Message	Kotori	Tohka, I think you left a spot over there.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? That way?! Got it!	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori... you—!	
Message	Shido	...! ...?!?!?!?!	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido...san... A-Are you okay...?	
Message	Shido	I'm not f—	
Message	Yoshinon	"It's totally fine! A perfect harem situation\nfor the lucky, perverted Shido-kun."	
Message	None	(*Grunt*! Y-Yoshinon...!)	
Message	None	(O-Oh no... I... can't...)	
Message	None	(T-Take it...)	
Message	Shido	*Wheeze*...*pant*...*wheeze*...*pant*...	
Message	Reine	"Hm... When I took your temperature at the
Fraxinus, you were normal... but it seems as
though you're starting to develop a fever."	
Message	Reine	You probably should rest more...	
Message	None	"(...This is poisonous. In so many different ways.
I'm sure my fever went up for other reasons...)"	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah... Then let's return to the Fraxinus. We have
to examine Tohka and the girls, too."	
Message	Shido	"K-Kotori... You totally knew what would happen,
and you just let it happen, didn't you...?"	
Message	Kotori	My, I have no idea what you're talking about.	
Message	None	(What does she think her brother is...?)	
Message	Reine	"I'm going to head back... Well, Shin...
You take care now."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, you seem worse than earlier...
Are you really okay?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... I'm fine, I think. Um... Thanks, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Yeah, whenever you need help, let me know!	
Message	Shido	Hahaha... haha...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Man, we might have overdone it.\nSorry, Shido-kun～"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Don't worry about it. Thanks for visiting.	
Message	Yoshino	"I-If you ever need anything...
please let me know..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right, Shido-kun.\nWe need to help one another!"	
Message	Shido	Thanks, you two.	
Message	Yoshino	"O-Oh... Sh-Shido-san... P-Please... don't push...
yourself..."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, got it. I hope your checkup goes well,
Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank you.	
Message	Yoshinon	"See ya!"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido... I'll look into what happened this time,
so you be sure to not do anything reckless
on your own anymore, okay?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	You can't rely on my powers right now...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What did you say, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Nothing. Later, Shido. Get some sleep.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I will.	
Message	None	(Gosh...)	
Message	None	(I let out a big sigh and stared at the ceiling.)	
Message	None	"(I couldn't get that last image of Kotori out of
my mind. She seemed so worried.)"	
Message	Shido	"Now that everyone's gone, I feel lonely...
Is that really sappy?"	
Message	None	"(At the end of the day, I realize spending time
with them is really precious. All this chaos has
become the norm.)"	
Message	None	"(In order for me to be able to stay with them,
I'll need to recover as quickly as possible...)"	
Message	None	(Hm... I wonder what time it is...)	
Message	None	"(I woke up and looked at the clock. It seemed
I had been asleep for a few hours.)"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, I wonder how Origami's
doing. She wasn't here to check up on me...)"	
Message	None	"(Things got twisted when Origami thought Kotori
murdered her parents...)"	
Message	None	"(I haven't been able to talk to her lately...
I wonder if she hates me now...)"	
Message	None	"(I know it's selfish of me... but I wonder if
there's any way that Origami and Kotori...
no, all the Spirits, could get along...)"	
Message	Shido	I wish... Origami would pay me a visit...	
Message	None	"(Hm...? Come to think of it... There's one more
person who hasn't come by to visit...)"	
Message	None	(Uh... Who... was it...?)	
Message	None	(...?)	
Message	None	(As I thought hard, I drifted off into sleep.)	
Message	Shido	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the?!	
Message	None	There's something in my bed?!	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?!	
Message	Origami	What?	
Message	Shido	Wh-Wh-What are you doing?!	
Message	Origami	Paying you a visit.	
Message	Shido	Huh... P-Paying me a visit?	
Message	Origami	I heard that you are now accepting visitors.	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, I see... Thanks.
Hey, wait! No! How did you get in, Origami?!"	
Message	Origami	From the balcony.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's trespassing.	
Message	Origami	Not if you don't tell anyone.	
Message	Shido	Y-You know...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(This is Origami Tobiichi. She's my classmate and
the super prodigy of Raizen High School.)"	
Message	None	"(Her grades are always ranked number one in the
class, let alone the country. To top it off, she's
athletic and basically a perfect all-rounder.)"	
Message	None	"(Her pale skin and unreadable expression give her
a mysterious vibe. She seems a bit
intimidating...)"	
Message	None	"(Last year, she made it into the top three of the
school's unofficial "Dream Girlfriend" rankings.)"	
Message	None	"(However, she's earned the nickname "Permafrost"
from being such a hard-to-get cool girl...
or so people say.)"	
Message	None	"(But... that could all be wrong. You see, she's
in the AST, an anti-Spirit division of the
Self Defense Force.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka, Yoshino, Kurumi, and Kotori... Origami has
battled them all, in order to defeat the Spirit
that killed her parents.)"	
Message	None	"(And recently, the culprit was thought to be my
sister, Kotori... so I had to fight against her.)"	
Message	None	"(Somehow, Origami listened to me and we were able
to avoid the worst, but... I haven't spoken to her
since then.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait!	
Message	Shido	Hey! Uhhhhh! O-Origami-san?! What are you doing?!	
Message	Origami	Paying you a visit.	
Message	Shido	That's not what I mean!	
Message	Origami	"It's a well-known remedy for this kind of
situation to warm the patient by
skin-on-skin contact."	
Message	Shido	Is that a popular thing now or something?	
Message	None	(I literally just heard the same thing earlier!)	
Message	Shido	Anyways, just don't take your clothes off!	
Message	Origami	...Why not?	
Message	Shido	"Because I said so! Just, no taking off clothes
allowed!"	
Message	Kotori	"It sure seems noisy... Shido, are you up?
Are you involved in something sk—"	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Kotori	"...What are you doing? Hurry up and
get away from Shido."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait, Origami! Please...
can you calm down? P-Please?"	
Message	Kotori	...What's the meaning of this?	
Message	Shido	"Sh-She's paying me a visit, that's all! I was out
for so long, she came to check in on me!
Right, Origami?"	
Message	Origami	Yes. What Shido said.	
Message	Kotori	"Really... I never knew paying a visit meant
sneaking in through the balcony like some kind of
burglar. Must be some kind of new slang."	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori!	
Message	Origami	"Efreet, I didn't come today to fight you.
Paying Shido a visit is more important."	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. It's so kind of you to spare me today...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	You guys!	
Message	None	"(I... I shouldn't let them be in the
same room any longer!)"	
Message	Shido	O-Origami! Just go home for today!	
Message	Origami	Shido...? What are yo—	
Message	Shido	"Right?! You do that! Thanks for paying me a visit!
I appreciate it! Later! Bye!"	
Message	Shido	Phew...	
Message	Kotori	"...Despite your current condition, you even found
a way to hit on Origami Tobiichi. You sure are an
idiot."	
Message	Shido	N-No I wasn't! I-I wasn't looking for anything!	
Message	Kotori	Uh-huh...	
Message	Kotori	...Well, I believe you.	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Kotori	"Why are you so surprised? I'd know more than
anyone that you don't have the guts to do it."	
Message	Shido	Oof...	
Message	Kotori	But I guess that's typical Shid—Stupid Shido...	
Message	Shido	Why do you have to go out of your way to say it?!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	(...?)	
Message	Kotori	"Listen to me, Shido. I want you to think hard with
your tiny hermit crab brain."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Vice Commander Kannazuki-san said that it's
not a crab brain, it's actually an intestine..."	
Message	Kotori	Did you say something?	
Message	Shido	N-No, nothing...	
Message	Kotori	"Now, I need to talk to you about what I came here
for. Seems like we're involved in something big.
Well, the whole of Tengu City is."	
Message	Shido	The whole of Tengu City? What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"We detected a very strong spiritual wave large
enough to affect the whole city."	
Message	Shido	Does that mean...	
Message	Kotori	"A Spirit may be involved... There's a big
possibility of that. But..."	
Message	Shido	...But?	
Message	Kotori	"As long as we don't know for sure, it can be
anything. There's a chance that it was a Realizer
experiment conducted by the AST..."	
Message	Shido	AST?!	
Message	None	"(Ratatoskr and the AST are the only ones using the
Realizer in Tengu City. There's a big chance they
were experimenting. Then, that means Origami—)"	
Message	Kotori	"But I think it's hard for the AST to emit
a frequency that significant."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	"No time to feel relieved. It doesn't change
the fact that something is happening."	
Message	Kotori	"And besides... I'm thinking there's a correlation
between that and your body losing Spirit powers."	
Message	Shido	What...? No way.	
Message	Kotori	"It's too close in timing to say it's a
coincidence. There are no abnormalities in you
that would explain it, are there?"	
Message	Shido	You have a point...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, it's all a hypothesis at the moment.
Now that I can't get ahold of the higher-ups,
I can't come to an easy conclusion."	
Message	Shido	What? You can't get ahold of them?	
Message	Kotori	"No, I can't get in touch with any of the
higher-ups at Ratatoskr."	
Message	Shido	D-Don't you think that's a pretty big deal?	
Message	Kotori	"I do, but I'm not dumb enough to deny the
reality that's happening in front of me."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	"We're able to conduct some investigations with
just the Fraxinus. I'm going to do what I can,
as much as possible."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	(Seriously, what is going on?)	
Message	Kotori	...?	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kotori	Shido... That girl... still seems to be outside.	
Message	Shido	Wh-Why are you telling me...?	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways, Shido. You work on making sure the
Spirits are as stable as they can be."	
Message	Kotori	"I know it won't resolve the main issue, but you
can at least limit the chances of them going
berserk."	
Message	Kotori	...It's noisy outside, so I'm leaving.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...
