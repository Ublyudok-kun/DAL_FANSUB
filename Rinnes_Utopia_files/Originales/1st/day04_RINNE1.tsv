Message	None	(It really is no good...!)	
Message	None	(I'm no longer able to fully control it alone...)	
Message	None	(But, why is this? Why won't it work...?)	
Message	None	(Is it not enough to mimic the Spirits...?)	
Message	None	(Was I wrong yet again?)	
Message	None	(The results I'm looking for...)	
Message	None	(Then, what I must do next is―)	
Message	???	Shido, wake up... It's morning already.	
Message	Shido	...Mm... Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, morning Rinne... What was that just...?	
Message	Rinne	"What was what? I'm not dancing the samba
or anything... Are you still half-asleep?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no... I didn't mean like that...
Lately, I keep having this weird dream..."	
Message	Rinne	"I see... Well for now, hurry up, change, and wash
your face. I'll make breakfast and wait for you
downstairs."	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	...Huh? Just me? Where's everyone else?	
Message	Rinne	"It seems like today everyone has something to do,
so they've already left."	
Message	Shido	Huh? I-I see...	
Message	None	"(Everyone together... Could it be an examination
on the Fraxinus or something?)"	
Message	Rinne	Here you go, I reheated the miso soup.	
Message	Shido	Thanks... I'll go ahead and eat.	
Message	Rinne	Yes, help yourself.	
Message	None	"(Everyone's gone out on some business
or another... I wonder what for?)"	
Message	None	"(Could Tohka and the others have lost control and
been taken to the Fraxinus? I hope nothing like
that has happened...)"	
Message	Shido	We're leaving now, bye.	
Message	Rinne	Good-bye...!	
Message	Shido	"...Er, I guess there's no point in saying that if
no one's home."	
Message	Rinne	"Hmm... Well, no one was here to hear that anyway.
With this sort of thing, staying in the habit of
saying it is what's important."	
Message	Shido	Really?	
Message	Rinne	Really.	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm, what's up?	
Message	Rinne	Are you free after school today?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Er, yeah.	
Message	Rinne	Then, can I make a reservation today, too?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course.	
Message	Rinne	Really? You won't get in trouble?	
Message	Shido	"I've got no reason to refuse.
Also, who'd I get in trouble with?"	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, or Kotori-chan?	
Message	Shido	Oh, er... I'll explain it somehow.	
Message	Rinne	That's good then. Actually... I was kinda worried.	
Message	Shido	About what?	
Message	Rinne	"You know, yesterday's date... I ruined it because
I collapsed and all..."	
Message	Shido	"Y-You don't have to worry about anything like
that! It can't be helped. Your health is
undoubtedly more important."	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... I guess I worried you again, Shido.
I hope today's date will be more fun than
yesterday's."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. But don't push yourself too much,
all right? You just admitted that you collapsed
yesterday."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, I know. You're such a worrywart, Shido.	
Message	Shido	It's fine. If you're in pain, then I'm in pain.	
Message	Rinne	Oh... Um...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... Well I meant, in a childhood
friend kind of way..."	
Message	Rinne	"Y-Yeah. I know. Don't worry about me taking it the
wrong way."	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	None	(Whew... It's finally over...)	
Message	None	"(Maybe it's because of the test, but it feels like
everyone's a little on edge.)"	
Message	None	"(But I feel like that's not the case for some...
Oh, speak of the devil. This seems like it'll be
a pain, so I'm gonna find a place to hide.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh, Itsuka? Where'd you go?
I feel like I saw you here just now..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Tch, that jerk. Is he on a date with another
cutie?! Some fiancé he is, that cheating bastard!"	
Message	None	"(―While I want to ask who the hell would be his
fiancé, it'd be more of a pain if he found me
here.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ahh... Mighty gods! Why is it only he who walks
in paradise each day? I beg of you, spare some
love for your humble servant! *sniffle, sniffle*"	
Message	Tonomachi	DAMN ITTTTTTTTT!	
Message	Shido	There he goes...	
Message	Rinne	Shido, what are you doing?	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! Oh, it's just you, Rinne...
Don't scare me like that."	
Message	Rinne	Were you hiding?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... Once I get caught by that idiot
Tonomachi, it's all over for the rest of the day."	
Message	Rinne	"That's rude to say, Shido...
But I guess you're right."	
Message	Shido	"Right? So, what do you want to do today?
Is there somewhere you want to go?"	
Message	Rinne	Where would you like to go, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Let's see... I didn't have any major plans...	
Message	Rinne	I'll leave it to you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Roger that. Then, let's go.	
Message	Rinne	Okay!	
Message	None	"(She left it to me, so I asked if we could change
into regular clothes. Yeah... This way feels
much more like a date.)"	
Message	Shido	"Now then, I'm getting a little hungry. Do you want
to get something to eat, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	Umm... What are you thinking of eating, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Hmm, lemme see... Maybe kinako bread?
I'm craving the exact amount of sweetness in
kinako powder. Tohka really likes it, too."	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, huh...?	
Message	Shido	Hmm? Did you say something?	
Message	Rinne	Nothing. I'd like that, too.	
Message	Shido	"There are lots of other stores. Are you sure
you're okay with it?"	
Message	Rinne	It's fine! Come on, let's go!	
Message	Shido	A-All right.	
Message	Bakery Worker	Welcome!	
Message	Shido	Ah, two kinako breads, please.	
Message	Bakery Worker	I'm sorry. We're all sold out today...	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see...	
Message	Bakery Worker	"How about our new addition to the menu, the
whipped cream bread?"	
Message	Bakery Worker	It's freshly baked. I highly recommend it.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, it does smell pretty good. What do you
think, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	"If you want to eat it, then
I think I want to as well."	
Message	Shido	All right, then two of those, please.	
Message	Bakery Worker	Yes, thank you very much.	
Message	Shido	Sorry the kinako bread was sold out.	
Message	Rinne	"It's all right, but this looks
good too, doesn't it?"	
Message	Shido	Should we try it now?	
Message	Rinne	It's freshly baked, so it's probably tasty.	
Message	Shido	I'll try it. *munch*...!	
Message	Rinne	Me too. *munch*!	
Message	Shido	"It's delicious! There's just the right amount of
sweetness in the whipped cream, and the dough's
freshly baked, too! This is so good."	
Message	Rinne	Mm, it really is delicious. I'm glad, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah!	
Message	None	"(Huh? I... feel like I've eaten bread with someone
else before, too...)"	
Message	Shido	―?!	
Message	Rinne	What's wrong, Shido?	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's nothing. I'm glad it was a good one.	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. Let's come back another time
to eat kinako bread."	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	Now then, where to next?	
Message	Rinne	Hmmm, is there anything you want to do, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Let's see... If you're okay with the very normal,
I guess the arcade would work..."	
Message	Rinne	Then, let's head out to the arcade!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Let's go!	
Message	Rinne	Yeah!	
Message	None	"(After being out in the hot sun for so long,
the crisp chill from the air-conditioning felt
nice against our skin.)"	
Message	Rinne	Whew, it's cool in here.	
Message	Shido	It is. Arcades are perfect for summer vacation.	
Message	Rinne	"You're right. It'd be nice to cool down once in
a while, too."	
Message	Shido	"Playing games can make you
heat up quite a bit, though."	
Message	Rinne	Huh, really?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Have you never been to
an arcade before, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	Ah, yeah... It's actually my first time.	
Message	Shido	I see... I guess that's not super surprising.	
Message	None	"(Hm? Now that I think of it, I feel like I took
someone else to the arcade for the first time
recently...)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, what's wrong?	
Message	Shido	"N-No, it's nothing. More importantly, is there
a game you'd like to play, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	"Hmm... It's my first time, so I don't know much
about the games that are here. Which one do
you usually play, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm, me? I usually go for the crane games.
If I'm alone, I play fighting games too."	
Message	Rinne	"Huh, so you try to get the plushie
from inside that box?"	
Message	Shido	Right. Do you want to try?	
Message	Rinne	Huh? I'm okay. I'll watch you try, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Er, but, it's your first time at an arcade and
all. You should try playing something. It's okay
to mess up."	
Message	Rinne	"Don't worry, I'm fine. Do you see something there
that you like, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Uh... W-Well... hm, maybe that?	
Message	Rinne	"That one, huh? It is pretty cute. I'll be cheering
you on!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	"(Actually, there's nothing that really catches my
eye, but I tried to pick something that the girls
at home might like.)"	
Message	Rinne	I hope you can get it!	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'll give it a try!	
Message	Rinne	Th-That was close! Try again, try again!	
Message	Shido	Then, one more time...	
Message	Rinne	Do your best, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	None	"(All right, I'll put my all into this. If I can
win, I'll give it as a present to Rinne...)"	
Message	Shido	Agh!	
Message	Rinne	Th-That's too bad...	
Message	Shido	"That's probably enough for today...
Let's head out."	
Message	Rinne	...Sh-Shido, is it really okay?	
Message	Shido	It's fine, don't worry.	
Message	Shido	...Sorry, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Why are you apologizing, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Well, that plushie just now, I was thinking about
giving it to you. But it didn't go as I'd hoped..."	
Message	Rinne	Oh, that? I'm fine, don't worry.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Thanks, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Then, where should we go next?	
Message	Shido	"Let's see. We had a snack, we cooled down at
the arcade, so now..."	
Message	Rinne	Now...?	
Message	Shido	"Hmmm... Is there any place you'd like to go,
Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	"Well, could you take me to a favorite spot of
yours, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Ah... Well, I guess I do have a place like that.	
Message	Rinne	All right, then. Let's go there.	
Message	Shido	Right... Let's go.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah!	
Message	Shido	...We're here, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	I see, so this is Takadai Park.	
Message	Shido	See, the view's really nice from over there.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Could I take a look?	
Message	Shido	"Haha, you don't have to ask me.
But don't lean out too far. It's dangerous."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, I'll be careful.	
Message	Rinne	"It really is a nice view. I feel like I'm
close to the city..."	
Message	Shido	"You can see all of Tengu City from this point.
I really like being up here."	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah, and the air is cooler than down in the city,
so it feels really nice."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Shido	Today's... the first time you said it.	
Message	Rinne	What are you talking about...?	
Message	Shido	You know, telling me what you wanted to do...	
Message	Rinne	"Oh... W-Was it bad that I did?
Maybe I was being selfish..."	
Message	Shido	No, it's not that. It's the opposite.	
Message	Rinne	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	"I... I want to have more fun with you, Rinne.
Where we create the day together...
I think a date like that would be nice."	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	"If we just keep doing what I want, I don't think
that it's okay..."	
Message	Rinne	...Why isn't it okay?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	Why isn't it okay to do what you like, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	No, I mean I want to do what you―	
Message	Rinne	"What's fun for you is fun for me, you know?
I'm happy enough to go along with what
you want to do."	
Message	Shido	Really?	
Message	Rinne	"Of course. Of course it's true!
Why would you even question it? You understand,
right? We're childhood friends, after all."	
Message	Shido	No! O-Of course I know... S-Sorry...	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	Sh-Should we... go home for today...?	
Message	Rinne	...Yeah.	
Message	None	(Ahh, why does it always end up like this...?)	
Message	None	"(But... I really feel like I can't have fun if
it's not the kind of date where Rinne
and I are both having fun...)"	
Message	None	"(Besides... It feels like Rinne's actually pushing
herself to go along with everything. It just
feels that way...)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder why Rinne got so upset...? She did
collapse yesterday, so maybe she's still not
well, and I pushed her...)"	
Message	None	(*Sigh...* Today's date was a failure...)	
Message	None	(It was like eating sand.)	
Message	None	"(Even though Rinne's food is so delicious, today
I felt so on edge, I couldn't really taste it...)"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?	
Message	Rinne	Shido...	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	Hey, do you have a little time right now?	
Message	Shido	What's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	W-Well... I'm sorry. About today, and yesterday...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	I don't know anything about dates with guys, so...	
Message	Shido	"N-No... I don't think it's something you have to
apologize for, you know?"	
Message	Rinne	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... Dates are something you have with two
people, so... if it didn't go well, it's partly my
fault, too."	
Message	Rinne	"Hey, Shido? Would you, um... like to go on a date
tomorrow, too? I want to redeem myself."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course I'll go with you.	
Message	Rinne	Good... Thank you.	
Message	Rinne	Then, I'll see you tomorrow. Good night, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Good night.	
Message	None	(Whew... That surprised me...)	
Message	None	"(But I'm glad that Rinne still felt like going on
a date with me again.)"	
Message	Shido	―Whoa!	
Message	Kotori	I'm coming in.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, you were here too.	
Message	Kotori	What do you mean by "too"?	
Message	Shido	"N-Nothing, just talking to myself.
Anyway, what's wrong?"	
Message	Kotori	I thought I'd just pass word along to you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kotori	"There was something strange that turned up during
today's analysis."	
Message	Shido	Something strange?	
Message	Kotori	"The spiritual wave we're following became
instantly unstable during a specific time frame.
The distortion patterns were almost the same."	
Message	Shido	...And what specific time frame was that?	
Message	Kotori	About 4 in the afternoon.	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	"Right now, I'm having Reine conduct an analysis in
detail, with that spiritual wave pattern's data
as the focus... But it's strange."	
Message	Shido	Strange...?	
Message	Kotori	"It's similar to a Spirit's mental graph
during a date."	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Kotori	And that of a failed date, too.	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Kotori	"Isn't it weird? While I was analyzing it, I felt
almost like I was monitoring a Spirit's date."	
Message	Shido	Maybe it's just a coincidence?	
Message	Kotori	"Don't put me in the same boat as someone else
I know. I'm not that stupid."	
Message	Shido	Wh-Who do you mean, someone else...	
Message	Kotori	You should ask your own heart that question.	
Message	None	(Oof...! She's totally talking about me!)	
Message	Kotori	"Listen. The Fraxinus saves data every time
you fail a date with a Spirit."	
Message	Kotori	"When I analyzed both the data from your failed
dates, and the spiritual wave patterns from
yesterday and today... Bingo."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yesterday and today... failed dates...?	
Message	Kotori	What? Do you have some kind of clue?	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's nothing. Nothing...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, whatever... We'll continue to analyze this.
So―"	
Message	Shido	―I just need to keep doing my job, right?	
Message	Kotori	"Right, the world keeps spinning as long as you
understand. All right, I'm going to sleep now.
Good night."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, good night...	
Message	None	(Yesterday and today... I was dating Rinne.)	
Message	None	"(And to be honest, it's hard to say that those
dates were successes. In fact, we always have
some sort of trouble, and―)"	
Message	None	(They were both failures.)	
Message	None	"(Kotori said it was the same as the data from when
I fail at a date. Doesn't that mean that I'm
involved somehow? Meaning―)"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha! No... There's no way...
That's not possible."	
Message	None	"(I can't stop laughing at such an outlandish idea.
It's completely ridiculous, isn't it?)"	
Message	None	(That my childhood friend is a Spirit...)	
Message	None	"(We've been friends for so long. No one would know
more than me that something like that is impossible.)"	
Message	None	"(Jeez, I'm kinda pathetic for considering
it. My thoughts will just go around in circles if
I keep thinking about this... I should sleep.)"
