Message	Shido	Kotori, I heard Yoshino collapsed! What happened?!	
Message	Kotori	"Calm down, Shido. The Fraxinus crew is also on
edge with all of the "situations" popping up,
so I'd like it if you didn't add to the stress."	
Message	Shido	Oof... S-Sorry... So, what about Yoshino...?	
Message	Kotori	"She didn't collapse from any injury or illness.
The spiritual power we were monitoring
suddenly became unstable."	
Message	Shido	Unstable? You mean... she lost control?	
Message	Kotori	"I wouldn't put it that way just yet, but if we
leave her as is, it could be a possibility in
the near future."	
Message	Shido	Was there a specific cause...?	
Message	Kotori	"It's currently unknown. It's hard not to feel
anxious in this situation. We'll just have to keep
an eye on her. You have to support her as well."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. You can leave that part to me.	
Message	Kotori	"That confidence is what makes me so anxious...
Whatever. Yoshino's in the infirmary, so go over
to see her right away. Careful not to agitate her."	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Message	None	"(It's so chilly in here. There's ice forming
everywhere... This seems pretty bad.)"	
Message	None	"(If Yoshino ends up losing control, it'll be even
worse. I have to hurry and calm her down...)"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino... Are you okay?	
Message	Yoshino	...Shido-san...?	
Message	Shido	"It's all right now. I'm here... Could you tell
me why you're crying?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon is...	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon...? What's wrong with Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon... is gone...!	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshi...non...!	
Message	None	"(It's true, Yoshinon was always on Yoshino's left
hand, but now she's nowhere to be seen.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, calm down. It's all right.
Yoshinon was with you just a while ago, right?"	
Message	Shido	So I'm sure she's somewhere in this room.	
Message	Yoshino	B-But...	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, it's okay.
I'll look for Yoshinon."	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay.	
Message	None	(Now then... Where to look...)	
Choice		Look under the bed.	
Choice		Look in the changing room.	
Choice		Look on the medical officer's desk.	
Message	Shido	"Maybe she fell off your hand and rolled underneath
the bed?"	
Message	Shido	"...I don't see her anywhere.
Looks like she isn't under here..."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"Maybe you dropped her when you were changing your
clothes before the examination...?"	
Message	Shido	"...Yoshino, sorry, but I'm going to look in the
changing room, okay? I-I'm not doing it for
any indecent reason!"	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	"...I don't see her. Looks like you didn't
drop her in the changing room..."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"Could it be that... when the medical officer did
your examination, they took her?"	
Message	Shido	This is the medical officer's desk...	
Message	Shido	"...Looks like she's not there.
Guess the officer didn't collect her."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshino	Is she... not here after all...?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Y-Yeah... I haven't found her yet.	
Message	Yoshino	"At this rate... If I can't see
Yoshinon anymore, I..."	
Message	Shido	Calm down, Yoshino! I'll definitely find Yoshinon!	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino... Stay calm and think carefully. Do you
remember where you last took her?"	
Message	Yoshino	I don't... know...	
Message	Shido	"You definitely had her when you came on board the
Fraxinus for your examination, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... We were together...	
Message	Shido	"Then at the very least, she must be on the Fraxinus
somewhere. When you got here,
what did you do first?"	
Message	Yoshino	"They said they'd... examine me... and laid
me down... on this bed."	
Message	Shido	You were with Yoshinon then, too...?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes... and then I got a little sleepy...
And then... when I woke up..."	
Message	Shido	"While you were sleeping in this bed, Yoshinon
disappeared."	
Message	None	"(Then she should be near the bed...
Huh? Could it be?)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Yoshino... but I'm going to look under
the mattress for a second, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Shido	...I knew it.	
Message	Shido	See? No need to worry.	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yoshinon...!
Yoshinon, Yoshinon!!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"...Bwah!! Good grief! How horrible, Yoshino...\nYoshinon was squished under the mattress and\ncouldn't even call out!"	
Message	Yoshino	I'm... sorry... Yoshinon...	
Message	Shido	"She must have gotten tucked under the edge of the
mattress. It's hard to notice when it's more
toward the foot of the bed."	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank you... so much...	
Message	Shido	I'm glad we could find her.	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hoo-whee, sorry for causing trouble!\nThanks to you, Shido-kun, I'm saved!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'm glad I was able to find you so quickly.	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah... Thank you...!	
Message	Reine	"...Hm. Apologies. This usually would have been
a matter we'd deal with ourselves."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, part of it was probably thanks to Shido,
so I guess all's well that ends well."	
Message	Kotori	"But what a surprising outcome. The Spirits... more
specifically Yoshino, lack sufficient interaction
with humans and are almost like kids in a sense."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'm really glad we were able to find her.
Yoshinon seems to be a precious friend to her."	
Message	Reine	...How long will you be able to say that?	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Reine	"While it's true that Yoshinon is contributing to
Yoshino's spiritual stability, conversely, it
shows how highly dependent on her she is."	
Message	Reine	"As was clear with today's incident, her happiness
hangs from the thin thread that is Yoshinon..."	
Message	Shido	I suppose that's true...	
Message	Kotori	"But, it's also true that we can't separate them...
You should be a little more careful too, Shido."	
Message	Shido	R-Right...
