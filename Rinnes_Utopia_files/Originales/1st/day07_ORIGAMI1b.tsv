Message	Shido	Hey, sorry!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Don't give me that look. I'll be quick.	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, what are you up to? I had to use the\nYggdra Folium to pass through the interference."	
Message	Shido	Oh, my bad! So, what do you want?	
Message	Kotori	"It's urgent. I've found the location of the\nenemy."	
Message	Shido	The enemy...?	
Message	Kotori	"It appears that Neo Tengu Tower was the\nsource of the barrier."	
Message	Kotori	"Ever since we identified both the monument\nand the outlet power as keystones, we were\nable to locate the central source of power."	
Message	Shido	"Neo Tengu Tower? Central source?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?"	
Message	Kotori	"What? Don't tell me your mind's affected\ntoo. What's wrong with you?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	...?! Wha... What?!	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, are you all right?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Sorry, something just came over me.
Is all of what you said true?"	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. We analyzed Spirit waves attached to\nthe barrier at the shrine too, which means these\nthree keystones are powering the barrier."	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Kotori	"And at the center of this triangle is where\nthe Neo Tengu Tower is located."	
Message	Shido	"So that's where this enemy is... The root of
all this trouble."	
Message	Kotori	"I'm sure of it."	
Message	Shido	"But why did any of this happen in the first
place? What do they want?!"	
Message	Kotori	"If you want to know, you'll have to ask\nthem yourself. Hence why I'm calling you."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	"Are you currently with Origami Tobiichi?"	
Message	Shido	Yes.	
Message	Kotori	"Tell her I said, 'Fight the enemy.'"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey!	
Message	Kotori	"I don't want to ask her either, but it can't\nbe helped."	
Message	Kotori	"The Spirits, including myself, aren't fully\nstable right now. She's the only one who\ncan fight in Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	B-But...	
Message	Kotori	"Didn't I tell you? I don't want to ask her\neither."	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Origami?	
Message	Origami	What is going on?	
Message	Shido	Oh, you see... Well...	
Message	Shido	"So, in order to break the barrier and revert
Tengu City to the way things were, we need
to go to the city and resolve the issue."	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Shido	"Origami, I feel terrible for roping you into
this."	
Message	Origami	I'll go.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait!	
Message	Shido	I don't want you to figh—	
Message	Origami	I know.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"I'm not going out of vengeance. This is for
you and me."	
Message	Shido	You and me?	
Message	Origami	That's right. For our future.	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	If you still plan to stop me...	
Message	Shido	"No, I don't. I'm not against this. You're right.
We need to do something about the barrier,
or there won't be a future to save."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Got it. Then, I'm going with you.	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"I can't afford to expose you to danger, but we're
not going to defeat the enemy. We're doing this
to protect what we love most."	
Message	Origami	...Promise.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. It's a promise!	
Message	Shido	"Neo Tengu Tower. I can't believe it was the
base this whole time."	
Message	Origami	Shido. No one else is around.	
Message	Shido	I know. It's too quiet despite how early it is.	
Message	Shido	Hm, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Shido. This is no good. They know you're\ncoming. All lifeforms around Neo Tengu\nTower have vanished. They cleared it out."	
Message	Shido	"If that's true, we still have no choice but
to go in, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"Yes, that's right, but don't let your guard\ndown."	
Message	Shido	You got it.	
Message	Shido	Well, here goes nothing!	
Message	Origami	Wait. Enter from the front?	
Message	Shido	"Didn't you hear me? We're not here to fight.
Just to protect our future. Let's try and talk
to them first."	
Message	Origami	"Shido, ever the optimist. No matter the
situation."	
Message	Shido	What's that supposed to mean?	
Message	Origami	Nothing. Let's go.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay!	
Message	Origami	...What the—?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Shido	Were you in my dreams...?	
Message	Origami	Who are you?	
Message	???	No one asked for this ending.	
Message	Shido	No one... asked?	
Message	???	"If only you were content to live in the idyll
contentment I created..."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Origami	Shido... Is that a Spirit?	
Message	Shido	"I don't know, but I don't think this is our first
time meeting."	
Message	???	"I am the ruler of this world, Eden.
If you prefer another name, call me Ruler."	
Message	Ruler	"But... telling you is pointless.
I will banish you."	
Message	Origami	Protect Territory, ignite!	
Message	Ruler	"Very well. Let me show you how foolish
you are."	
Message	Origami	Shido, get back!	
Message	Origami	Razor Blade! No Pain!	
Message	Ruler	...Pointless.	
Message	Origami	"Urgh! What the—?! The enemy Spirit's powers
are eating through my Territory!"	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Origami?! Are you okay?!	
Message	Origami	Shido! I can't move my body!	
Message	Ruler	Scatter.	
Message	Origami	Aah! Ugh... AAH!	
Message	Shido	ORIGAMIIIII! Damn it! What happened?!	
Message	Ruler	"Farewell, Shido Itsuka. I hope for your next
dream to be a happier one."	
Message	Shido	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Ruler	You promised me... you'd care for Origami.
