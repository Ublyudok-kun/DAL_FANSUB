Message	Shido	Heeey, Yoshino...?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... what, is it...?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well... I was thinking about going
to Tengu Tower, but..."	
Message	Shido	"If you're free, would you like to come with me?
If there's nothing there, we could go up to the
viewing platform before we head home."	
Message	Yoshino	Is it okay... that I come with you...?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. If you're okay with it, Yoshino, I'd be
glad if you did."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'll go! I'll be... with you, after all...	
Message	Shido	"Sorry... Well, let's just enjoy
it as a night stroll."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes!	
Message	Shido	All right. Then let's go.	
Message	Shido	"There are still quite a few people. The tower
still seems to be open to visitors."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"There doesn't seem to be anything strange about
the monument, either... Maybe I really was
imagining things..."	
Message	Shido	"No, just in case... I'll check it a
little closer..."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san, watch out!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the?!	
Message	Yoshino	...!!	
Message	Shido	"A-An angel?!
Is this... an Angel...?"	
Message	???	"......"	
Message	Shido	Whoa!!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san!!	
Message	Shido	I-I'm fine! It barely missed my feet!	
Message	???	"......"	
Message	Shido	Are they saying... not to get close?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuun! It's dangerous, so be careful!"	
Message	???	"......"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa... That was close!
Wh-What's going on? There really was something..."	
Message	???	"......!"	
Message	Shido	Ngh! Are they going to attack again?!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...! I-I will!	
Message	Yoshino	Zadkiel...!!	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"I won't let you hurt Yoshino or Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino!	
Message	???	"......"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the hell are they...?!	
Message	???	"......"	
Message	Yoshino	I won't let you... do any more than this!	
Message	Shido	"They... disappeared...? It's almost like... when
a Spirit's Astral Dress disappears..."	
Message	Yoshino	*Pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino! Are you okay?!	
Message	Yoshino	"I'm... fine...
I'm glad... you're okay, Shido-san..."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Yoshino. You saved me.	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"Still, what was that Angel-looking thing...?
Did nobody around us see anything?
Everyone looks as if nothing happened..."	
Message	Yoshino	I felt... a very... strong power...	
Message	Shido	"My hunch was right. This isn't just some
skyscraper. It must have something to do
with the barrier surrounding Tengu City."	
Message	Yoshinon	"There's a strong possibility you're right～\nLet's tell Kotori about this."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I have to report this to her... Yoshino, I'm
sorry, but let's end our walk here. It's a shame
we couldn't go up to the viewing platform, but..."	
Message	Yoshino	No... It's, okay...	
Message	Shido	Then, let's head back home for today.	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Shido	"...So that's what happened. Thanks to Yoshino,
we were somehow able to get back safely."	
Message	Kotori	...And?	
Message	Shido	Er, well... There's not much else besides that...	
Message	Kotori	"You think it's all okay because
it turned out fine?"	
Message	Kotori	Don't kid around with me, you idiot!	
Message	Shido	Oof...!	
Message	Kotori	"What do you think you're doing on your own without
telling me?! What were you going to do if
something had happened?!"	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to make you worry, but..."	
Message	Kotori	"Do you understand your own situation?!
You don't have my spiritual power right now!
I've told you that time and again!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... I know I'm totally at fault.	
Message	Kotori	"Well... Most importantly,
it's good that you're safe..."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	We'll investigate the monument right away, but...	
Message	Kotori	"Because of your reckless actions, there's a
chance the Spirits might go berserk. Next
time, be sure to consult with me."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I promise I'll do that.	
Message	Kotori	"As long as you know. The barrier covering Tengu
City seems related to this, but we won't know
until we get some results."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I'll leave it to you.	
Message	Kotori	"I hope you'll make some progress, then. Leave
the situation to us. Shido, you just continue
looking after the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, got it...
