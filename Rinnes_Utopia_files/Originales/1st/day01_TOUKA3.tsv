Message	None	(Hmmm. Is he not over here either?)	
Message	Shido	Heeeeey, Tonomachiiiiii!	
Message	Shido	Where are you, Tonomachiiii!	
Message	Shido	Are you okaaaay?! If you're here, say something!	
Message	Shido	"It's no use. I don't see him anywhere.
Seriously, where did he go?"	
Message	Shido	"Could he really have been spirited away?
No, like that would even happen. Besides,
Tonomachi made up the whole Tengu Cow thing..."	
Message	Shido	"T-There's no such thing as ghosts, anyway...
Even if there were, I'm not scared at—"	
Message	Shido	Yikes!	
Message	None	(Huh? What! Something's coming this way!)	
Message	None	"(Huh?! What, what? What the hell is it?
It's coming this way with an intense speed?!)"	
Message	None	(O-Oh crap... M-My back's gonna give out!)	
Message	???	I've found you!	
Message	Shido	U-Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	
Message	Tohka	W-What is the matter Shido?!	
Message	Shido	Huh? Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, yes, but?	
Message	Shido	"P-Phew. Please, don't scare me like that...
My heart almost jumped out of my mouth!"	
Message	Tohka	Huh? I don't really understand, but I apologize.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, wouldn't it be good for you to go to the hospital once?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Why?	
Message	Tohka	"Your heart jumping out of your mouth
sounds like a serious medical condition."	
Message	Shido	Oh, no, it's just a saying... I'm okay, really...	
Message	Tohka	Oh, okay. If that's the case, then...	
Message	Shido	Hey, weren't you going back with the others?	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Why are you asking me that? Did you not
want me to be here with you, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	No, nothing like that, just...	
Message	Tohka	You're all alone. What would I do if something happened to you?	
Message	Tohka	"I-If you got spirited away... and if I was no longer
able to see you, it would, you know... be very saddening!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well, uh... okay, okay.
Let's search together."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I believe that is the best option!	
Message	None	"She's made it sound like Tonomachi's already been spirited
away, but... I'll just leave that alone for now."	
Message	Shido	Let's try going to the other side.	
Message	Tohka	Yes, alright then.	
Message	Tohka	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Aah?! T-T-T-Tohka! What's wrong?	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? The grass is surprisingly tall, and there's a slight fog.
With such terrible visibility, we will be separated if
we do not hold hands."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I see. Okay.	
Message	Tohka	Let us go.	
Message	Shido	A-Alright...	
Message	None	"(Tohka's hand... it's so soft and warm.
Even in this darkness, I feel reassured.)"	
Message	Shido	Heeeeey, Tonomachiiiiii!	
Message	Tohka	Tonomachiiii! Where are yooooou?	
Message	Shido	It's no use. He's not over here either.	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Shall we return?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Should we head back and give our offerings first?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	Shido	Eeeeek!	
Message	Tohka	Mm!	
Message	None	(Ah?!)	
Message	Shido	T-T-Tohka, this isn't... no!	
Message	Tohka	It's fine. I do not mind.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Tohka	"Y-You were scared, yes?
You could not help yourself."	
Message	Tohka	"So, um... if you... really wanted this, Shido...
we can stay like this a little longer..."	
Message	Shido	Er, no, I'm fine now, so...	
Message	Tohka	Rr! J-Just do it!	
Message	Shido	Ack! T-Tohka?!	
Message	Shido	Oogh!	
Message	Tohka	How is it, Shido? Do you feel calmer?	
Message	Shido	C-Calmer? T-This is making me even more...	
Message	Tohka	Shido?	
Message	Shido	W-What?	
Message	Tohka	I feel very reassured... you know?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... I feel, reassured too.	
Message	Tohka	We are on the same page then...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	None	(?!)	
Message	Tohka	?!	
Message	Kotori	Ah! Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	"Uwaaaaahh... W-Wait... Kotori?!
What are you doing here?!"	
Message	Kotori	"Oogh. What kind of question is that?
You were taking so long that we all
went looking for you!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, no! I'm sorry! We just got a little lost...	
Message	Kotori	There's no point if the search party gets lost!	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry...	
Message	Kotori	Well, we were able to find you guys, so it's okay but...	
Message	None	"(Ah... I can't really say that I completely forgot about
Tonomachi...)"	
Message	Kotori	Hmm...by the way, what were you two doing just now?	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! We weren't doing anything!
Right, Tohka?!"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes! We were doing nothing!	
Message	Kotori	Hmmm... Well, whatever.	
Message	Kotori	Alright, let's hurry and leave an offering, then go home!	
Message	Tohka	Yes, y-you are right! L-Let's go, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Shido	"Still... I wonder what Tonomachi's doing...
Just where is he? Ugh..."
