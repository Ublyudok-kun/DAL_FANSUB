Message	Shido	A date, huh? I'm really not feeling up to it.	
Message	Shido	"And lately... something about Rinne's been
bothering me."	
Message	Rinne	Shido, did you call me?	
Message	Shido	Whoa! R-Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	Yes?	
Message	Shido	Er, um... sorry, but I really didn't call for you or anything.	
Message	Rinne	Aw, really? I thought you were going to take me out.	
Message	Shido	H-How did you know I wanted to take you on a date?	
Message	Rinne	Um, well... I just said that for the heck of it. You wanna take me out, huh?	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, you're really proactive, aren't you?
But seriously, do you really wanna go out
with someone like me?"	
Message	Shido	That's...	
Message	Rinne	Hehe, if you want to take it back, now's your chance.	
Message	Shido	I-It's you. I want to go with you.	
Message	Rinne	Huh?! Y-You really... w-wanna go with me?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	None	"(In all honesty... it's true that I'm curious about her.
Besides, it'll be nice to relax with Rinne.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Um... instead of someone like me, it'd be better
to invite someone else..."	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Oh, look! Tohka-chaaan!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is the matter?	
Message	Rinne	Shido wants to go on a date with you.	
Message	Shido	Huh?! Rinne!	
Message	Tohka	Oh! Is that right, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Er, w-well you see...	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, could it be that you do not wish to date me?
Is it possible... you're still upset about what happened
at lunch?"	
Message	Shido	No, not at all. It's fine.	
Message	Tohka	"Sorry, Shido. I was so worried. I stayed so long in the
infirmary that they threw me out. I'm glad you're alright."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	None	(If I turn her down here, it'll definitely worsen her mood.)	
Message	Shido	Let's go on a date, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Yes! It is decided!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yep!	
Message	Tohka	Okay, let us go right away! All three of us!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	Three of us?	
Message	Tohka	Why, yes! Aren't you coming, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Huh?! No, I...	
Message	Tohka	Let's go already!	
Message	Rinne	Ah! T-Tohka-chan?!	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Tohka	Hey! What's taking so long, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Right, right! I'm coming!	
Message	None	"(And that's how, for some reason, the three of us
ended up going on a date.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm... would you like to see a movie, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Um... I thought it was implied a date
involved a movie... w-was I wrong?"	
Message	Shido	"No, you're right. I think going to a movie
is pretty standard."	
Message	Rinne	I-I see. That sounds good to me then.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, look!	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Lemme see, a 3D blockbuster...
Oh, that one is a romance movie, huh?"	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, I think this looks like something you'd like.	
Message	Shido	I feel like she'd pick either one.	
Message	Tohka	Hrm. I do not really wish to see this one.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Rinne	...?	
Message	None	(I totally thought Tohka would've wanted to see this.)	
Message	Shido	Out of curiosity... why not?	
Message	Tohka	I have seen this movie before.	
Message	Shido	What?! Y-You went to see it alone?	
Message	Tohka	What do you mean, Shido? We watched it together.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	R-Really?! You could have told me that...	
Message	Shido	"I-I really don't remember... but now that you mention
it, I think we did go out... when was that again?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmph! Shido, have you forgotten the day you spent with me?	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry.	
Message	Tohka	Try to remember. It was...	
Message	Shido	Hm? When was it?	
Message	Tohka	Um... w-when was that exactly?	
Message	Shido	Are you okay, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Erm! I-I have most definitely seen it! With you, Shido!	
Message	Shido	R-Right... we really saw it, right? I feel like we did.	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's Kotori. Excuse me, I'm gonna take this really quick.	
Message	Tohka	Alright. Hurry back, okay?	
Message	Rinne	We'll be waiting.	
Message	Shido	Right, just a minute.	
Message	Shido	Hello, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"As usual, you sound like something losing its carbonation."	
Message	Shido	"What's with the attitude?! I know you didn't call me
just to tell me that, so... what's up?"	
Message	Kotori	"Do I seriously need to spell it out for you?\nHow's the dating going? Did you get any takers?"	
Message	Shido	Oogh... well, yeah, but...	
Message	Kotori	"But you're having some trouble again?\nHow is it that you get in trouble so often?"	
Message	Shido	"T-That's none of your business! Besides,
it's not like I wanna get in these situations!"	
Message	Kotori	"Whatever. So what kind of trouble is it today?"	
Message	None	"(Ugh... this is hard to even talk about because here
I am asking Rinne out when she's not even a Spirit...)"	
Message	Shido	"S-So, I'm taking Tohka on a date, but... well...
Rinne is with us too, and..."	
Message	Kotori	"What?! Why on earth is Rinne with you?!"	
Message	Shido	T-That's what I wanna know!	
Message	Kotori	"If your carelessness gets Tohka so jealous that she...\nWait. Actually, Tohka's mental state isn't so bad."	
Message	Shido	That makes sense. She's the one who made this happen.	
Message	Kotori	"Huh? Wow. I see. Interesting.\nOkay, then you should just continue."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	"If it was Tohka's idea, and she's happy with it,\nthere really isn't anything wrong here."	
Message	Shido	I see. Alright, but...	
Message	Kotori	"What? Is there something else?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, Rinne suggested we come see a movie,
but I don't think Tohka wants to."	
Message	Kotori	"Are they arguing about what to do for your date?"	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not that serious. But forcing Tohka to see
a movie would stress her out so I thought maybe
we should do something else."	
Message	Kotori	"What about the pool? The movie theater's nice,\nbut going to the pool is a total summer date.\nPlus, some eye candy wouldn't hurt, right?"	
Message	Shido	What?! I wouldn't... no, that doesn't—	
Message	Kotori	"I know. I'm already aware that you're a genus lower\nthan vegetation, who can't even hold an impure thought,\non the edge of extinction."	
Message	Shido	Excuse you.	
Message	Kotori	"I'm just telling it like it is. Tohka has a swimsuit,\nso it'll work just fine. Oh, but her room in the Spirit\nhouse is still out, huh?"	
Message	Kotori	"Go pick out something new for her at the Twin\nBuilding B in front of the train station."	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, last thing: watch yourself, okay? You're\nalready in an unstable situation and you don't\nwant to say or do anything reckless."	
Message	Shido	Right. Understood.	
Message	None	"(Phew. Now that I think about it, it's a good
thing Tohka is here. If I was dating Rinne, I'm
not sure I could've made an excuse...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hrm. You took forever, Shido.	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry! That lasted longer than I thought it would.	
Message	Rinne	Is everything okay? That must've been an important call.	
Message	Shido	"I'm fine, I'm fine. It wasn't anything too important.
Hey... would you two rather go to the pool?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh! The pool! It's quite fun there!	
Message	Shido	I think so, too. Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Um... well, I don't have a swimsuit, so...	
Message	Shido	"We can go to the department store in front of
the train station. I'm sure they have a sale going
on right now, too."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? But I already have a swimsuit, remember?
The one you picked out for me."	
Message	Shido	"I know, but the apartment... it's currently, um...
going through renovations so we can't... go in."	
Message	Tohka	Renovations?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Basically, it needs some repairs, or I guess
it's in the middle of them rather, so we won't be
able to get to your room until it's done."	
Message	Tohka	Oh! That's right!	
Message	Shido	"Okay, so let's head towards the train station.
Does that sound good, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	Um, yes... I suppose we could go check out that store.	
Message	Shido	Alright! Let's get going!	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	None	"(We went to the Twin Building B in front of the train station,
bought swimsuits and towels, then headed to the pool...)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Hurry! Let us hurry to the pool!	
Message	Shido	Yeah!	
Message	Shido	Oh, Rinne... were you really alright with that swimsuit?	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. The one you chose for me was the best.
Thanks."	
Message	Shido	Y-You're welcome. Then, should we go?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah!	
Message	Tohka	Heeeey! Riiiiinne! I'm over heeere! Hurry oveeeer!	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Tohka-chan! You shouldn't run around so much!	
Message	None	"(I got to the pool after quickly changing into
my swimsuit. When I got there, I heard Tohka
and Rinne's voices echoing off the domed roof.)"	
Message	None	(Those two are fast...)	
Message	None	"(Before I knew it, the two were climbing the
water slide made to look like a rock formation
at the far end of the huge pool.)"	
Message	Tohka	Rinne! We slide from here into that lake!	
Message	Rinne	Huh? W-We're already going? But...	
Message	Tohka	"What's the matter? You don't want to slide?
This is very fun, you know. Once you try it,
you won't be able to stop!"	
Message	Rinne	But this is a date with Shido, so we should wait for...	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Kyaaa!	
Message	Rinne	Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!	
Message	Shido	Ah! R-Rinne! Are you okay?!	
Message	Rinne	*Gasp*	
Message	Rinne	T-That... I wasn't expecting that...	
Message	Shido	Rinne! Are you alright?	
Message	Rinne	"I-I'm fine! It was a lot faster than
I thought it would be, but it was fun."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's... R-Rinne!
Er, your um, swimsuit..."	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	Oh!	
Message	Shido	H-Hurry! You have to fix it!	
Message	Rinne	Oh, right. Yeah... you're probably right.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Rinne	Shido... it doesn't bother me if you look, you know.	
Message	Shido	Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"But then you'll be in quite a predicament,
won't you, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	What?! You dummy! What are you saying?!	
Message	Rinne	"Tohka-chan's not looking right now.
It might be our chance."	
Message	Shido	Our c-chance?! Rinne, cut it out!	
Message	Rinne	Shido... look at me.	
Message	Tohka	"Heeey! Riiiinne! How was iiiit?!
I'm neeeext!"	
Message	Shido	What?! R-Rinne! H-Hurry and fix it already!	
Message	Rinne	Aaallright. Hehe... were you shocked?	
Message	Shido	I thought my heart was going to stop...	
Message	Rinne	Good grief, Shido. You're such a wimp... hehe.	
Message	None	(No, that's not the problem here...)	
Message	Rinne	Shido, how does it look? Is it tied right?	
Message	Shido	I-It looks fine.	
Message	Tohka	Ahahaha!	
Message	Tohka	Woo! Hahaha! Shido, this is quite fun!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it looks like it! It's my turn!	
Message	Rinne	Shido... just now...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	Never mind.	
Message	Shido	Er... okay.	
Message	None	(What's with Rinne?)
