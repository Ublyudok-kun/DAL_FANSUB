Let's get luuuuunch!"

even noon! Who the hell you callin' boyfriend?!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Haha. What's wrong, Itsuka? You embarrassed?
Well, that part of you ain't half bad either."

I'm gonna deck you!"

I can't keep on embarrassing you, now can I?"

Can't you be more conscious of your actions?"

left while I dealt with Tonomachi.)"
