Message	Shido	Kotori, you here?	
Message	Kotori	...What?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I was curious about the Tengu Tower.
I was planning to check it out."	
Message	Kotori	"What? Are you still on about that? What's
there to be curious about?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I can't explain it, but I just can't get
it out of my head."	
Message	Shido	Did you want to accompany me?	
Message	Kotori	Me...? On a night like this?	
Message	Shido	"Well, if anything, I thought we could hit the
observation desk, look at the night sky, and
come back."	
Message	Kotori	"Is that... a roundabout way of asking me out
on a date?"	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh. Well, it is what it is, right? If...
that's okay with you, that is."	
Message	Kotori	"I-If it's a date, then you should've said so
from the get-go. I won't reject you."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Then, let's take a night stroll.	
Message	Kotori	Okay. I'm going to change, so wait for me.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Shido	"There's still a bunch of people here. Looks
like the tower's still open."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Looking at the monument now, there's nothing
out of the ordinary. Guess it was all in my head."	
Message	Kotori	"See, it was nothing. Jeez, I'm so busy and
you waste my time like this. What are you
going to do about it?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, there's gotta be something more.
I just want to be sure. Let's look at it a bit
closer."	
Message	Kotori	Shido, step away!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?!	
Message	Kotori	What's going on?!	
Message	Shido	A-An Angel...?! Is that an Angel...?	
Message	None	"(It's different from what the Spirits produce. Almost like a ""guardian of some sort."")"	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Kotori	Shido!	
Message	Shido	I-I'm fine! It was just my foot.	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the hell is it?!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Rngh! It's after my feet!	
Message	Kotori	Is it warning us? Telling us not to come near.	
Message	Shido	Then, is there some kind of secret here?!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	What?! Is it attacking?!	
Message	Kotori	Shido!	
Message	Shido	Kotori! Youâ€”!	
Message	Kotori	"Don't move, Shido!
Camael!"	
Message	Shido	Ca-Camael...!	
Message	Kotori	Cannon Mode: Megiddo!	
Message	Shido	...Kotori!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What was that thing...?!	
Message	Kotori	Urgh!	
Message	Shido	"It's disappearing. Almost like... the Spirit's
Astral Dress is disappearing."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori! Are you okay?!	
Message	Kotori	I'm fine. Shido, you're safe.	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kotori. You saved me.	
Message	Kotori	"I-It's fine. I mean, I had no choice but to
fight!"	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, man. What was that thing? People
around us act like nothing happened. Didn't
they see it, too?"	
Message	Kotori	"I sensed something very powerful. This is
a big deal."	
Message	Shido	"My hunch was right. This isn't just some
skyscraper. It must have something to do
with the barrier surrounding Tengu City."	
Message	Kotori	"Right. Looks like your hunches aren't as
off as I thought."	
Message	Shido	I'm not your brother for nothing, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. As much as I hate to admit it, you
did well this time. I'll contact the Fraxinus
and look into it immediately."	
Message	Shido	"Guess our night stroll ends here, huh? It's a
bummer that we couldn't go up to the observation
deck."	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. Let's go home for the day. We'll come
back another day."	
Message	Shido	Right. That's a promise.	
Message	Kotori	Mm... Promise.
