Message	Shido	"I'm done with errands. Now I've got plenty
of time to go on a date."	
Message	Shido	"I wonder if Kotori's already home. I guess
I could stop by the house."	
Message	Shido	Huh...? A transmission from the Fraxinus?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Hey, Shido-kun. How are you?"	
Message	Shido	"Kannazuki-san...? What's the matter?
Is something wrong?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"You see... I would love it if you could\nassist me with something, Shido-kun."	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Well... I would like to ask you to
participate in an experiment."	
Message	Shido	Uh... I have a bad feeling about this.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Now, don't be like that. It's an important\nexperiment that could determine the\nfuture of the Fraxinus."	
Message	Shido	So, what kind of experiment is it?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Well, I have personally put a lot of thought\ninto developing a new date A.I. system..."	
Message	Shido	Personally...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"The Fraxinus' ship A.I. is highly advanced,\nbut just in case it shuts down, we will need\na back-up plan, or else...!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Should that happen, I was thinking of having\na failsafe system developed."	
Message	Shido	"Uh. I've got a seriously bad feeling about
this."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Now, now. Don't be like that! You will be\nfully supported and protected by the Fraxinus'\nprized technicians."	
Message	Shido	"How is that supposed to comfort me?!
What system is it, anyway?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"It's based on the ultimate moe game.\nA title they say will stand the test of time."	
Message	Kannazuki	"It's considered to be a masterpiece of the\ntsundere genre. It's called, "Big Brother, Bad!"	
Message	Shido	"From the name alone, it doesn't sound
like a healthy game!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Come now, don't be like that...\nThe commander approved it herself."	
Message	Shido	What... Kotori has?	
Message	Kannazuki	"That's right. The commander gave her approval\nof this system in case of emergency."	
Message	None	"(Kotori did...? If that's true, will there be
consequences if I fail to comply...?)"	
Message	Shido	"Um, so this simulation... When do I have
to do it, and who's the target?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Immediately, of course! And the target\nis our idol, the commander!"	
Message	Shido	Why does this feel rigged to fail?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"It'll be fine! The commander's already\nreturned home!"	
Message	Shido	What...? O-Oh, I see...	
Message	Kannazuki	"The commander gave the go-ahead whenever\nyou're ready. Please, give it your all."	
Message	Shido	"Okay... So I should head over to Kotori's
place...?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Thank you!"	
Message	None	(To be honest, I'm terrified...)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	What is it...?	
Message	None	(Whoa... She already looks cranky.)	
Message	Shido	Kannazuki-san, I've made it to Kotori's.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Understood. Location: Home.\nTime: Pre-supper. Prepping!\nOne moment, please!"	
Message	Kotori	Hey, what are you sneaking around for?	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... Nothing.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Ohhh! The simulated results have generated!\nYou'll have one of two choices..."	
Message	Kannazuki	"One, I can't fight these feelings. Hug her!\nTwo, see me for who I really am. Strip down!\nOkay Shido-kun, go ahead and choose!"	
Message	Shido	What... the heck?!	
Message	Kotori	"Hey! I'm the one who should be saying that!
You call for me, and you've got nothing to say?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Shido-kun, act quickly. The commander is\nangry..."	
Message	Shido	...Argh!	
Choice		"I can't fight these feelings." Hug her!	
Choice		"See me for who I really am." Strip down!	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori... I'm sorry!	
Message	Kotori	Aaah!	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori, is this okay?!	
Message	Kotori	"Wh-What are you talking about?!
You freaking pervert!"	
Message	Shido	GAH!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What's gotten into you?!	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, Kannazuki-san said he's performing
an experiment for a new A.I. system..."	
Message	Kotori	"Experiment? New A.I. system? Kannazuki?
Y-You... went along with his experiment to
subject me to this...?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I heard you approved it.	
Message	Kotori	"I only approved this supposed new system,
but I didn't bother to hear all the details."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	Anyways, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Yes, imouto-sama?	
Message	Kotori	There will be no next time. Remember that.	
Message	Shido	O...O...Okay...	
Message	Kannazuki	"The commander's cold gaze, coupled with\nher scathing response. Incredible! This\nsystem is already yielding fantastic results!"	
Message	Shido	"Excuse me?! Wait, the purpose of this
system is..."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Obviously, it's an intuitive simulation\nplatform designed to coax extreme\nemotional responses from women!"	
Message	Shido	GET RID OF IT THIS INSTANT!	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori... I want you to see all of me!	
Message	Kotori	"What the—? Wh-Why are you taking your
clothes off?!"	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori! D-Do you like this?!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What are you talking about?! You pervert!	
Message	Shido	GAH!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What has gotten into you?!	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, Kannazuki-san said he's performing
an experiment for a new A.I. system..."	
Message	Kotori	"Experiment? New A.I. system? Kannazuki?
Y-You... went along with his experiment to
subject me to this...?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I heard you approved it.	
Message	Kotori	"I only approved this supposed new system,
but I didn't bother to hear all the details."	
Message	Shido	"But I was given the options either to hug you,
or strip off my clothes, so I figured at least
taking off my clothes would only embarrass me."	
Message	Kotori	So, you chose to remove your clothing?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... I thought it'd be better than
forcing contact onto you."	
Message	Kotori	"B-But you've hugged me plenty of times...
You idiot."	
Message	Shido	Man, she stormed off...	
Message	Shido	"Besides, how the hell did I end up like this?
Hey, wait! I thought this was a simulation,
Kannazuki-san?!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Obviously, it's an intuitive simulation\nplatform designed to coax extreme\nemotional responses from women!"	
Message	Shido	I got the butt end of the stick here!!
