Message	Shido	"Oh! I-I'm so sorry, Tohka! I just remembered
something! I-I'll see you later!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm?! Wh-What do you mean?! Where are you
going, Shido?!"	
Message	Shido	No one's following me, right...?	
Message	Shido	"I was sure rude to Tohka... Then again, I felt
bad eating Rinne's bento in front of her..."	
Message	Shido	I'm starving, so I'll eat it...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Shido-san. Hello.	
Message	Shido	...Hm? Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Are you alone?	
Message	Shido	"N-Not because I don't have anyone to eat
with. I-I just had a situation to deal with..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... I wasn't saying anything.
...May I sit next to you?"	
Message	Shido	Huh...? S-Sure, I don't mind...	
Message	Kurumi	Then, excuse me.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	"My... Don't mind me. You can go ahead
and eat."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Sorry.	
Message	Kurumi	No problem.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	"It's hard for me to eat when you're staring
like that."	
Message	Kurumi	"Why? Who cares? It's not like you've got
anything to lose."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but...	
Message	None	"(Having her stare at me while I eat is
uncomfortable. Maybe I should change
the topic...)"	
Message	Shido	U-Um... about that thing, the other day...	
Message	Kurumi	...Oh, about that time at the lake?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... That was... a crocodile, right?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. It had escaped from the zoo.	
Message	Shido	"Wait, the zoo was on the news... The one
whose owner had died...?"	
Message	Kurumi	"That's right. Something odd is going on in
that zoo."	
Message	Shido	Odd?	
Message	Kurumi	"It's not a big deal. Besides, the crocodile is
doing fine. I've taken it under my wing..."	
Message	Shido	"Under your wing...? That big thing? Shouldn't
you hurry up and return it to the zoo?"	
Message	Kurumi	I... refuse to do so.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	It's too sad to put it back in the small cage.	
Message	Shido	Okay, but...	
Message	Kurumi	"Living within confines, watching every moment
of your life pass you by. How is that any
different from death?"	
Message	Shido	I guess you have a point, to an extent...	
Message	Kurumi	"If possible, I would like to find a place where
it can be set free..."	
Message	Shido	"You shouldn't. Do you want the zoo to go
out of business? Besides, can zoo animals
even re-enter the wild?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... I wonder about that. It may be
a part of nature."	
Message	None	"(That's too cruel. Even for cats and dogs,
once they experience being fed, they can't
just go back to living on the street.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, crap... Lunch time's over.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, that went by fast...	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'll be off now. What are you going to
do, Kurumi?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hm... Good question. It's not like I can
sneak into class, so I'll be on my way."	
Message	Shido	I see. Well, later, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Okay, goodbye...
