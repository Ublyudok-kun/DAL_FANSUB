Message	Shido	Oh? Did Origami go home already?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yo! It's the nice guy, Itsuka-kun!
Still haven't gone home yet?"	
Message	Shido	Why are you still here?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Isn't it obvious? I was waiting around so that
I could go on a date with you!"	
Message	Shido	Come on, man! What if someone hears us?!	
Message	Tonomachi	HAHAHA! Let them hear!	
Message	None	"(He's a lost cause. If I spend too much time
with him, my head's gonna explode.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, but I need to get ahold of Origami.
I don't have time for you."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hehe. Too bad, Itsuka. I just saw Tobiichi
walk past the front gate."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	None	"(I wonder if I can make it in time! Or, should
I just give up?)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, Itsuka. Who you gonna choose?
Your friend, or a girl?"	
Message	Shido	"Tonomachi, I know damn well that I won't
choose you! Later!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, damn it! You're gonna leave your friend
hanging like that?! You cruel bastard! You
monster!"	
Message	None	"(Oh no. She's gone! Man, I didn't make it on
time.)"	
Message	None	(Hm?! Is that her over there...?)	
Message	Shido	Hey Origami!	
Message	Origami	...Shido?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm so glad I caught up with you!	
Message	Origami	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Oh well, um... I was hoping y-you and I c-could
go on a date together?"	
Message	Origami	I wouldn't mind.	
Message	Shido	I-I see. That's good. Um, so where should I go?	
Message	Origami	...Come with me.	
Message	Shido	Huh? O-Oh, okay.	
Message	Origami	Come in.	
Message	Shido	Th-Thanks...	
Message	Shido	"HEY! W-WAIT! Wh-Why are you taking your
uniform off?!"	
Message	Origami	"Huh...? I'm home, so I'm changing. Am I
not allowed?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you can. Sorry, I misunderstood. B-But
I'd appreciate it if you did so in another
room."	
Message	Origami	Got it.	
Message	None	"(I couldn't help but react when she started
taking her clothes off. Almost like I was in
danger...)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	U-Uh, what do you want to do?	
Message	Origami	Anything you want to do, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"I can do anything you wish, Shido.
Whether it's... embarrassing or painful."	
Message	Shido	W-Well...	
Message	Origami	Tell me, Shido.	
Message	Shido	H-Huh?	
Message	Origami	Order me.	
Message	Shido	O-Order you?!	
Message	Origami	Tell me... everything you want me to do. Hurry.	
Message	Shido	....Oooooookay! I-I will! I'll say it!	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Shido	U... Uh... S-Study! That's right! Let's study!	
Message	Origami	...Okay.	
Message	None	"(Aah. It's not just in my head. I wonder if it's
because I lack concentration, or if it's because
I'm curious about Origami.)"	
Message	None	"(Alone with Origami in her room. The door's
locked shut, so I can't hear anything from the
outside.)"	
Message	None	(All I can hear is Origami writing away.)	
Message	None	"(It's amazing how, when it comes to studying,
Origami can flip a switch and remain focused.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami! Excuse me!	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. I'm studying.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry.	
Message	Kannazuki	Oh, Shido-kun?!	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kannazuki	It sounds like there's weak signal wherever\nyou are. I used the Yggdra Folium.	
Message	None	(Th-That's right! I was in Origami's room.)	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry. I'm in kind of an unusual place.	
Message	Kannazuki	It's fine. I was just surprised we couldn't\nget ahold of you. As long as you're safe, Shido-kun,\nit's all right. How are you feeling today?	
Message	Shido	"How am I feeling? Well, I'm studying with
Origami right now."	
Message	Kannazuki	Origami...? Oh, the girl from the AST who went\nat it with the commander, right?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes.	
Message	Kannazuki	Ah, I'm so jealous! I hope one day she can\ngive me a hard punch, too!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kannazuki	So how's the studying going?\nIntense, I presume?	
Message	Shido	"I-It's not intense. Well, Origami's just really
focused on her studies. I can't get much done."	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, I understand. A normal reaction from\nspending time with someone so dedicated,\nI bet.	
Message	Shido	"I-It's true that I'm interested in her, but
it's not as intense as you think."	
Message	Kannazuki	Oh, how troublesome. If we had any data\nabout her preferences, then I could have\nassisted you.	
Message	Kannazuki	Hm, how's this. I will give you two pieces\nof advice.	
Message	Shido	Oh... I'm fine, thanks!	
Message	Kannazuki	Now, don't be like that. I've had my fair\nshare of experiences in the past—	
Message	Shido	"N-No! Kannazuki-san, I appreciate the gesture,
but I'll figure it out. Sorry!"	
Message	Kannazuki	Wait, Shido-kun! But I'm confident—	
Message	None	"(Phew. Sorry, Kannazuki-san, but if I took your
advice, I feel like something terrible would
happen.)"	
Message	None	(He's kind, but a little off.)	
Message	Origami	Shido, you okay?	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. Sorry, just finished.	
Message	Origami	"I see, but it surprises me to hear that you were
able to communicate with someone here"".
Who were you talking to?"""	
Message	Shido	W-Well, um...	
Message	Origami	"If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to.
You can tell me someday. That's all."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Sorry.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Oh... You're amazing, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"When I asked if we could study, you immediately
switched gears, you know? I've never seen anyone
tune out outside interference like that before."	
Message	Shido	"It takes me so much time to get my focus
together."	
Message	Origami	"When studying for tests, I find short bursts
of concentration to be more effective. You
shouldn't have to waste your time."	
Message	Shido	"Wow... I guess you're valedictorian for
a reason."	
Message	Origami	If you can adopt this habit, anyone can.	
Message	Shido	"I see, but the stuff we learn doesn't even
matter in the real world. Even in short bursts,
it's hard for me to focus."	
Message	Origami	"Shido, are you aware of the English word,
school""? Do you know its etymology?"""	
Message	Shido	Never heard of it.	
Message	Origami	"It is said to be derived from the Greek word,
scholeio"". It means leisure."""	
Message	Shido	"L-Leisure...? That's the last thing I would've
expected when thinking of school!"	
Message	Origami	"In ancient Greece, the number of slaves was
double to the average citizen, which meant
students were relieved of manual labor."	
Message	Origami	"Essentially, they were afforded the luxury
of time. With this remaining time, people
elevated themselves with education."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, guess I see the connection.	
Message	Origami	"If you go by the original definition, the act of
learning, however you may perceive its meaning,
is a freedom you've been given."	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh. That's a lot to unpack. So are you saying
that schooling was the only method people
had to elevate themselves?"	
Message	Origami	"Yes. However, if you attend school and improve
yourself, you grow closer to achieving your
dreams. Think of it that way."	
Message	Origami	"That's why I don't feel like anything I'm
doing now is a waste of time."	
Message	Shido	I see... Origami, you inspire me.	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"I knew you were a top student, but I always
just figured you to be a genius! Hahaha, it's
just funny, I guess."	
Message	Origami	Huh? What about that is funny?	
Message	Shido	"That's not what I mean. I don't know how
to explain it, but... it was educational."	
Message	Origami	I see. If you say so, then I'm happy to hear it.	
Message	None	"(What? R-Really? She doesn't look too happy
to me.)"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever
seen Origami smile.)"	
Message	None	(...Yeah, I haven't.)	
Message	None	"(I wonder if Origami can't express feelings
like laughter normally because her parents
were murdered by Spirits.)"	
Message	None	"(But seeing Origami let her guard down
every now and then is always nice.)"	
Message	None	"(I get it, but if she couldn't bring herself
to smile again, then that would make for
a sad life.)"	
Message	None	"(I wish that I could see Origami smile
one day. Hopefully I can share a laugh
with her, too.)"	
Message	None	"(But... I wonder if I could ever make that
happen. I mean, as Kotori says, I'm pretty
dense.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I'm not too confident, but I want to try!
Yeah, I'll get a bright smile out of Origami!)"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, don't stare at me like that. You'll
make me blush."	
Message	Shido	Huh? W-Were you blushing just now?	
Message	Origami	Mm...	
Message	Shido	Hm. I don't think that day will ever come.	
Message	Origami	Huh...?
