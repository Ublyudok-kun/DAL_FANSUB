Message	Rinne	Alright, I'll be borrowing your kitchen then.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sorry for the trouble all the time.	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you promised not to say that, right?
Next door neighbors help each other out, after all."	
Message	Shido	"Of course. If there's ever anything I can help with
at your house Rinne, you can always ask me."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, Shido. But I don't think there's anything right now?	
Message	Shido	It's true, you do have it together, Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	...Is that, so? I hope so...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	It's nothing. Alright then, I'll prepare things quickly.	
Message	Shido	Alright, I'll be watching the pot on my end. I'll leave that side to you.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Leave it to me.	
Message	Tohka	――S-Shido! Rinne!	
Message	Shido	Hm? W-What's wrong, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	I-Is it alright if I watched!?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Watched...what?	
Message	Tohka	Well! You making supper! You're about to make it now, are you not?	
Message	Rinne	We were just about to start making it.	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! Then please! Allow me to observe!	
Message	Rinne	Hmm...I don't mind, but wouldn't it be boring to watch...?	
Message	Tohka	Not in the least! I insist!	
Message	Rinne	R-Really? Then...sure, of course.	
Message	Tohka	Really!	
Message	Rinne	Hee hee, if you're alright with me, then I'll help you anytime.	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! Rinne! I owe you so much!	
Message	Rinne	"...Oh, if you'd like, instead of just watching,
would you like to try...making it together?"	
Message	Tohka	"B-But that is...would it be alright?
I may not make it very well..."	
Message	Rinne	It's all right. I'll help out too, so...	
Message	Tohka	A-All right...	
Message	Shido	Then, should I help too?	
Message	Tohka	Y-You cannot Shido!	
Message	Shido	Huh? W-Why?	
Message	Tohka	You just aren't allowed!	
Message	Rinne	"A-Ah ha ha ha ha...Umm, e-either way, it looks like you're
not allowed, so why don't you wait while watching TV, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Er, ah, okay...	
Message	Rinne	"...Then, once you take off the sprout, peel off the skin,
and slice it into chunks...like this. You can cut it about this large."	
Message	Tohka	H-Hmmm, I see...	
Message	Rinne	"――Oh, if it seems too hard to take the skin off with a knife,
it might be better to use a peeler."	
Message	Tohka	P-Peeler? What is that?	
Message	Rinne	It's this. It's a tool to peel off the skin. Here.	
Message	Rinne	See?	
Message	Tohka	"Ohhh! It peels the skin off so easily!
This is becoming quite fun! You're amazing, Rinne!"	
Message	Rinne	Ermm...It's not like I'm amazing or anything, but...	
Message	None	"(...Why do I suddenly have a strange feeling of being left out?
I feel a vague sense of loneliness...)"	
Message	Tohka	R-Rinne! W-Will this do?	
Message	Rinne	"Let's see, it's hard to cook carrots all the way through,
so it might be better to cut them smaller than the potatoes, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, I see!	
Message	Tohka	H-How is this?	
Message	Rinne	"Right, just like that. You're good at this, Tohka-chan.
But don't get carried away and cut yourself, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	R-Right!	
Message	None	"(...They both seem to be doing fine,
so it might be good this way...)"	
Message	Rinne	Today is meat and potato stew that Tohka-chan helped make!	
Message	Shido	Ooh, it came out looking delicious!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! P-Please try eating it!	
Message	Shido	Let's see...	
Message	Tohka	H-How is it...!?	
Message	Shido	...Mm!? This is delicious!	
Message	Tohka	"Ohhh! That is good! Then please eat this over here too!
And this one too!"	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay okay,  I got it!
I'll eat all of them, so please wait a moment.
I can't fit them all at once, and I won't be able to tell the taste."	
Message	Tohka	Ah, r-right! I'm sorry, Shido...	
Message	Shido	"No, you don't have to apologize, but...
Here, you made this together with Rinne and all,
so you should eat it too. It'll surprise you!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm!? T-That's right!
I was so concentrated on having you taste it, I forgot!"	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Now then, I'll eat!	
Message	Rinne	Hee hee, please dig in.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Kotori-chan, Yoshino-chan, please eat it too.	
Message	Kotori	Yeah! Time to eat!	
Message	Yoshino	L...Let's, eat!	
Message	Tohka	"Ohhh!? T-This flavor is exceptional, Shido!
The potatoes have been cooked all the way through without crumbling,
and the flavor has seeped in!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah! Well...there are lots that have an interesting shape,
but it's really good. I'm glad it came out well, Tohka!"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! It is thanks to Rinne. I thank you!	
Message	Shido	You're right. We're grateful for you, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, thank you.
The taste has gotten even better for how much effort
Tohka-chan put into it, don't you think?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I'd like to make it with you again!	
Message	Rinne	Sure. Just tell me anytime you'd like.	
Message	None	(...You know, Rinne is a really good person.)	
Message	None	(Good grief, a lot really happened today.)	
Message	None	"(...Still, those stone steps right after the sports festival was
a little too much. I'm hurting here and there...)"	
Message	None	"(Now that I recall, when we were going up those steps...
Tohka was acting kinda weird, I think? It felt like she was
obstinately against going up futher――)"	
Message	None	"(T-That's right! Those stone steps! No matter how you think
about it, not reaching the top no matter how long I was climbing
is strange. Why didn't I realize it until now...?)"	
Message	None	"(Does this mean this is a phenomenon occuring in Tengu City...?
For now, after I take a bath and relax my muscles,
I'll go report this to Kotori.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder why...my body's strangely heavy...maybe I'm tired...
Well, I am still recovering, so I guess that makes sense, but...)"	
Message	None	(It might be nice to take a slow hip bath once in a while...)	
Message	None	(I walked a lot today, so maybe I'll take a nice, relaxing bath.)	
Message	Shido	Agh! K, K-K-K-Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	Hm?	
Message	Shido	"Er, ah, this is! I didn't mean!?
I did want to talk to you, but!"	
Message	Shido	"Er, ah...y-you see, um...I was wondering if the
shampoo might have run out, so..."	
Message	Kotori	――Ack...!	
Message	Shido	W-Wait! I-I can explain! Listen, this is――	
Message	Kotori	"You...siscon...lolicon...!
PERVERT IDIOT BROTHEEEEEERRRR!!!!"	
Message	Shido	GWAAAAAAAAHH!!!!	
Message	Shido	...Sitting seiza-style is starting to get painful...y-you know?	
Message	Kotori	...Huh, you think this is enough of a punishment?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"...You saw what you must not see, so of course this
punishment is expected, right?"	
Message	Shido	"...N-No, this is...
I-I just...happened to glance that way, and..."	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm sorry! But please believe me!
It was absolutely not like I went to peek or anything――"	
Message	Kotori	"I know that much. Even if you were a pedophile and someone
with a perverted taste, you wouldn't go that far."	
Message	Shido	"Don't just decide someone's tastes like that!
If anything――"	
Message	Kotori	If anything～? What is it～?	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing...	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. Be careful not to make headlines in
tomorrow's newspaper, got it?"	
Message	Shido	Like heck I'd be in tomorrow's paper!	
Message	Kotori	"...So, what was your business?
You had some business with me, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"Or has seeing your cute sister's body
caused your mind to go blank?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't remember seeing anything, and my mind
hasn't gone blank!"	
Message	Kotori	Hmmmm...	
Message	Shido	N-No, more importantly, listen! At Takadai...	
Message	None	"(I talked with Kotori about what happened at Takadai
with Tohka. First, about the endless stone steps, then...
About how strange Tohka was acting.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Takadai Park, huh...that's worrying.
I'll investigate on my end too...but if your story's true,
it might be difficult to figure out the cause..."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"You said Tohka was acting strange, right?
It's possible something intervenes with the consciousness
of anyone getting near or trying to investigate that place."	
Message	Shido	Intervenes...?	
Message	Kotori	"It means they mess with your consciousness.
Making you unwilling to approach, or it makes you
unsure of what you do or don't know."	
Message	Shido	"N-No way!?
Then...For example, me even talking to you about this,
it's possible something's been done to me...is that it?"	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. That's why this is a problem with no answer.
...I don't know why that memory's left in your mind, though."	
Message	Kotori	"Take care of yourself, okay? It's possible this memory could
be some sort of breakthrough."	
Message	Shido	Right...I'll be careful. That's really scary too, after all...	
Message	None	"(I get a shiver down my spine.
To have my own perception twisted while I'm unaware is,
to be frank, nothing else but simply terrifying.)"	
Message	Kotori	"But if the memory was intentionally left in your mind,
this may be some sort of warning.
A warning not to interefere with them..."	
Message	Shido	"A warning, huh...?
I wonder what intention the culprit
behind this incident has..."	
Message	Kotori	"Who knows? To be honest, we're completely stuck.
All we know is that there's readings of a special spiritual power
all around Tengu City...that's all."	
Message	Kotori	"For now... Until we gather information,
it'd be best not to get unnecessarily close to
the inside of Takadai. It's a little too dangerous."	
Message	Shido	Right, I understand.	
Message	Kotori	"Right now, something large is brewing. This phenomenon is
happening in the middle of Tengu City, and there's no way
the Spirits aren't involved."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kotori	"――For some purpose, they've cornered us into this situation...
That's at least definite."	
Message	Shido	...I, see...	
Message	Kotori	Don't make that face.	
Message	Shido	But...we have no recourse, right?	
Message	Kotori	"This and that are completely different. Ratatoskr are working
as hard as they can, after all. You need to think of your role... of stabilizing
Tohka and the other Spirits. That's something only you can do, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Yeah...right.	
Message	Kotori	"But...if you notice anything strange, please report it.
There's no guarantee next time will be the same as this, though..."	
Message	Shido	...Right.
