Message	None	"(I'm glad the date yesterday with Tohka went
well.)"	
Message	None	"(Now that Tohka's gotten back to normal, it feels
like the house has gotten a little brighter.)"	
Message	None	"(It may be because of how unstable the Spirits
had become that the dates started feeling like
an obligation to me.)"	
Message	None	(But I should've faced them sincerely...)	
Message	None	"(I think for now I've cleared up any
misunderstandings... I feel like inviting Tohka
and having a nice date now.)"	
Message	None	"(If it's for Tohka's sake, then it should be cool.
...Ah, Kotori might be angry if she heard me
saying something like that.)"	
Message	None	"(Ahh jeez! Nothing'll happen if I think idly!
For now, I'll try asking out Tohka!)"	
Message	Shido	"T-Tohka! Today, um... would you want to go
on another date?"	
Message	Tohka	A date! Of course!	
Message	Shido	Haha, I'm glad.	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? I can think of no reason to reject your
invitation. Anywhere on a date with you is
fun after all!"	
Message	Shido	G-Gotcha!	
Message	None	"(I-It's a little embarrassing, but she's the usual
Tohka.)"	
Message	Tohka	"So, where to today? Will it be the shopping
district for another assortment of delicious
treats?"	
Message	Shido	No. We did that yesterday, so...	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. I'm fine with anywhere, so long as it's with
you, Shido."	
Message	None	"(...! Tohka occasionally says things casually that
make my heart pound, but I just can't get used to
it. But this is the Tohka I want to be with.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey Tohka, do you remember?	
Message	Tohka	Hmm?	
Message	Shido	We went on a date once, to the aquarium.	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh! The place where a bunch of un-sliced fish
swam around, yes?!"	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. At that time, um, things were hectic,
and we couldn't look around quietly together,
right?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes. That day was, well... I was very lonely.	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Tohka	"Y-You needn't apologize. Your stomach wasn't
feeling well, yes?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(...! Just remembering it makes my heart hurt!
It was a white lie so I could leave the building.
That's why I'm getting a re-do with Tohka!)"	
Message	Shido	"That's why, today, let's hit the aquarium one
more time. I regret not being able to look around.
Of course, if you don't wanna go, that's okay."	
Message	Tohka	Yes. I wish to go with you too, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Tohka. Then it's decided.	
Message	Tohka	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Oh, do you want to go eat somewhere after
all?"	
Message	Tohka	"Th-That's not it! Today at the aquarium, um...
You won't flee anywhere, will you?"	
Message	Shido	Of course not! I'll always be with you. I promise.	
Message	Tohka	I-I see! Then, fantastic!	
Message	Shido	Haha. Then let's hurry and go!	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	None	"(The summer crowds make it feel even hotter.
I want to get into the aquarium already and cool
down...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Why are you glancing around, Shido? Are you
looking for something?"	
Message	Shido	"No, I just thought it's crowded because it's a
Sunday, as expected. At this rate, the aquarium
is probably crowded all week-long."	
Message	Tohka	Hm, I see. Then...	
Message	Shido	"...! T-Tohka?! Why are you suddenly taking
my hand?"	
Message	Tohka	"With this many people, we may end up getting
separated. If we're like this, then it should be
fine, yes?"	
Message	Shido	Oh... Y-Yeah, you're right.	
Message	None	"(Somehow managing to suppress my wildly
beating heart, I properly return Tohka's hold
with my left hand.)"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, then let's go!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(Under the bright sunshine of early summer, as
Tohka directs her smile towards me, my heart
once more begins to race uncontrollably.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka's light tunic and short shorts, in this
season, fit her lively spirit well. She was
endlessly dazzling.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Is something the matter? You stare so
intently at me."	
Message	Shido	"Er, ah, no... It's nothing, nothing at all!
Why don't we hurry? The dolphin show's going
to start."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I look forward to it!	
Message	None	(Haha... Was I able to play it off...?)	
Message	None	"(After looking at some of the fish exhibits, the
show was about to begin. We sat, waiting on the
outdoor bleachers as the seats began to fill.)"	
Message	None	"The pool furthest from us was fashioned into a
large stage. There were hurdles, slides, and small
pools; most likely used for the penguin show.)"	
Message	None	"(In front of the stage was a huge pool, and
surrounding the pool were bowl-shaped stands.)"	
Message	None	"(We were sat in the very front row. Talk about
having the best luck.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! It's almost time for, what was it, the
thing known as a ""show"" to start!"	
Message	None	"(Tohka was in high Spirits, like a kid at a candy
store.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, the opening show is apparently the
Lovebirds penguin show."	
Message	Tohka	"Lovebirds""? What is that?	
Message	Shido	""Um. Do you remember what I told you before
about marriage?"	
Message	Tohka	"Y-Yes! It is when two people who love each other
promise to always be together and live together,
yes?"	
Message	Shido	"That's right. ""Lovebirds"" refers to a married
couple that stays happily together for eternity."	
Message	Tohka	Hrm! I-I see... Then Shido, with you—	
Message	Shido	Oh, looks like it started!	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh! What is that strange thing waddling towards
us?!"	
Message	Young Lady	"Hellooo, everyone! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Introducing the lovebird Humboldt penguins,
Hatchan and Piichan!"	
Message	Young Lady	"All right, please give everyone a warm welcome,
you two! Together now, okay? Be happy!
......Umm..."	
Message	None	"(The two penguins performed no particular trick,
merely poking incessantly at the hostess' legs,
begging for food.)"	
Message	Young Lady	"Oh, I'm sorry! I forgot to tell you all something
very important! If these two don't eat, they can't
be motivated to do anything!"	
Message	Young Lady	"Yes yes, I know, I knoooow.
Here you go! Delicious, right? See?
Here, isn't this gooooood?"	
Message	None	"(The hostess fed several small fish to the
penguins from the bucket she was holding.)"	
Message	Young Lady	"All right, please give everyone a warm welcome,
you two! Together now, okay? Beeeee happy!"	
Message	Young Lady	......	
Message	None	"(After wolfing down all the fish they could, the
two penguins couldn't muster a greeting, and
began waddling towards the slide over the pool.)"	
Message	Young Lady	"H-Heeey! Hatchan? Piichan? Weren't you
listening to what I was saying?"	
Message	Young Lady	"You're not listening, are you? Okay! I get it now!
I forgot to tell you all something very important!
These two in fact, can't greet at all!"	
Message	Tohka	"Ah ha ha ha! Hey, Shido! Penguins are quite
dull creatures, aren't they?"	
Message	Shido	"You're right. But when you look at them together,
they look like a real couple, don't they?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Th-That is true!	
Message	Young Lady	"Okay then! Both of you feel like using the slide,
don't you? Then I'll give you both a generous
amount of food!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, they can use the slide?!	
Message	None	"(As the penguins waddled towards the slide on a
whim, the hostess cleverly scattered the small
fish, directing them up the stairs of the slide.)"	
Message	Young Lady	Now! The couple will now slide down!	
Message	Young Lady	"Okay! Now, here we go this time!
3! 2! 1! Gooo!"	
Message	None	"(Listening to the call, the penguins dove onto
the slide—or so we thought—instead, they walked
down the slope and hopped off the edge.)"	
Message	Young Lady	O-Oh, my...	
Message	Young Lady	"Oh, my. How calm and collected of them. Well,
these sorts of days happen. Ah ha, ha ha ha..."	
Message	Young Lady	"By the way, this species of penguin is known as
the Humboldt penguin!"	
Message	Young Lady	"Once Humboldt penguins become a couple, they
stay together forever! ...Or so they say.
Quite the dedicated pair."	
Message	Young Lady	"Alright! And that was Hatchan and Piichan's
""Lovebirds Penguin Show""! Thank you so much!"	
Message	Tohka	H-Hey, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Tohka	"D-Do you think I can also become a ""lovebird""?"	
Message	Shido	...! I think it's too early to say...	
Message	Tohka	"From here on, until eternity... I-I want to be
with you, Shido... Is that no good?"	
Message	Shido	...! I-I see... I-I... Tohka, with you, um...	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Young Man	"Hello everyone! Sorry to keep you waiting! Now,
it's time for the ""Dolphin Splash Show""! Our
dolphins are the pride of the aquarium. Enjoy!"	
Message	Tohka	Oh... Ohhh! It started again, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	None	"(A host wearing a wetsuit appeared at the poolside
stage, opening the latticed gates by both sleeves.
Then, several dolphins swam out into the pool."	
Message	Young Man	Now, then! First, say hello to our guests!	
Message	None	"(The dolphins turned towards the stands and,
while standing, stuck their upper halves out of
the water, wiggling their fins.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Wow! That's amazing, Shido! Dolphins can
understand human speech?!"	
Message	Shido	"They're apparently very smart animals.
I'm sure they understand us."	
Message	Tohka	"I see. Is that so?!
Still, that's quite impressive!"	
Message	Young Man	"Yes! Excellently done! It looks like they're in
very good moods, having met everyone today!"	
Message	Young Man	Oh, so much applause! Thank you very much!	
Message	None	"(As the young man and woman answered the
crowd's reactions, they handed out rewards
to the dolphins that had come closer.)"	
Message	Young Lady	"Now, as thanks for the applause, it's a little
early, but it's service time! Hey everyone!
Did you make sure to purchase a raincoat?"	
Message	None	"(Hmm, a raincoat...? Oh, I guess they were selling
some at the entrance.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, what is a ""raincoat""?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well, you see, the kids in the front row are
wearing some. It's so they don't get wet when
they're splashed."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm, I see. Is it all right that we are not
wearing ones ourselves?"	
Message	Shido	"P-Probably. Not too many other people bought
one, so I'm sure it's not all that bad—"	
Message	Young Lady	Then, here's the first greeting! Here you go!	
Message	None	"(At the woman's beck and call, the dolphins
began to react.)"	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh?!	
Message	None	"(Then, the dolphins leapt up at the very
edge of the pool.)"	
Message	Tohka	Oh?!	
Message	Shido	Uwah!	
Message	Tohka	......Hmmm?	
Message	Shido	A-Are you okay, Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	"Ha ha...ha ha ha ha ha ha! This is quite funny,
Shido! My skin has been soaked almost immediately,
no?"	
Message	Shido	...! T-Tohka! Y-Your clothes are—!	
Message	Tohka	Ah?! Sh-Sh-Sh-Shido! Wh-Where are you looking?!	
Message	Shido	Huh?! No! I-I'm not looking!	
Message	Tohka	A-Are you sure?!	
Message	Shido	Yes! I-I'm absolutely—	
Message	Tohka	Urf!	
Message	Shido	Augh?!	
Message	Tohka	......?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	"Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! They've done it again!
You can't afford to let your guard down at a show!"	
Message	Shido	"Ack! T-Tohka! I-I told you, you need to hold
yourself—"	
Message	Tohka	...! D-D-Don't look, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm not looking, I'm not!
I'm not looking at all!"	
Message	Tohka	H-Hrrmm!	
Message	Tohka	Agh!	
Message	Shido	Gah! A-Again?!	
Message	Tohka	......?	
Message	Shido	Pffft! Ah ha ha ha ha!	
Message	Tohka	Rrrr! Shido! What is so funny?!	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, sorry! You're completely soaked, Tohka!
I just thought we hit jackpot on these seats!"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Is this a jackpot?!	
Message	Shido	"In a way. If you're soaked, all you can really do
is enjoy it, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm. It's true that it's fun to be splooshed! I
am starting to have fun waiting for the next
sploosh to come!"	
Message	Shido	Haha. That's just like you, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What do you mean?!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no, it's nothing! Still, you really are
sopping wet, Tohka... Pffft, hahaha!"	
Message	Tohka	"Hey, Shido! Don't laugh! It is not as if I had
intended to become wet."	
Message	Tohka	Achoo...!	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey! Are you okay?! We need to hurry and dry
you off—"	
Message	Tohka	Pffff, hahahahaha!	
Message	Shido	*snerk...* Hahahahaha!	
Message	None	"(It's childish, but this was so much fun, it
couldn't be helped.)"	
Message	None	"(There were misunderstandings, and differences in
feelings. I'm sure more could still happen, yet
I want to suffer, worry, and laugh with Tohka.)"	
Message	None	"(Like Reine-san's story, will we one day,
stumbling as we do, be able to find a perfect
distance to warm each other?)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka...?	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, what is it?	
Message	Shido	"T-Tohka, y-you said to me that... you always
wanted to be together with me, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes...	
Message	Shido	"So, I'm not sure if this is what you want to hear,
but, well... Tohka, I—!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	"Aah! I-I'm sorry! I'll turn it off now.
Oh, it's Kotori..."	
Message	None	"(I wonder why it feels like this call, of all
moments, is especially important...)"	
Message	None	"(But today... Today, I promised I'd stay together
with Tohka. We're having fun right now. There's
no reason to pick up the phone.)"	
Message	Rinne	Promise that from now on, you'll cherish\nTohka-chan. No matter what happens, you\nwon't let her go... Promise me.	
Message	None	"(I suddenly remembered Rinne's words.
That's right, I promised Rinne too, but...
What if Kotori's call is really important?)"	
Message	None	"(I feel strangely uneasy. Why am I anxious
all of a sudden?)"	
Message	Tohka	...Sh-Shido?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	None	"(That's right. The answer's already there inside
of me! Of course, with this call, I'll—)"	
Choice		Pick up.	
Choice		Don't pick up.
