Message	Shido	Heeey, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Um... I'd like it if you could come with me for
a bit. Something's really bothering me about
the Tengu Tower... Are you not up to it?"	
Message	Tohka	"I-I do not mind, but... are you sure you want to
go with me?"	
Message	Shido	Yes, I want to go with you, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	I-I see...!	
Message	Shido	"You were the one I saw the monument with this
morning, so―"	
Message	Tohka	Oh... That's why...	
Message	Shido	Huh? What is it?	
Message	Tohka	I-It's nothing...!	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... If you're really okay with it, I was
thinking of us having a ""viewing platform"" date
to take one last look at it..."	
Message	Shido	"Since we'll be there anyway, I was thinking
of us having a ""viewing platform"" date
to take one last look..."	
Message	Tohka	Ohh! That is a good idea! Then let's go!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... I'll do my best this time...
I'll do my best... so that I can marry Shido..."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka? What have you been mumbling about?	
Message	Tohka	Ah! I-It's nothing! I-I'm completely normal!	
Message	Shido	"No... No matter how you look at it, you don't seem
normal..."	
Message	Tohka	Either way, I'm normal!	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I see.	
Message	Shido	"There are still quite a few people. The tower
still seems to be open to visitors."	
Message	Tohka	Shido... Did that large rock really start glowing?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. When I saw it this morning, I'm pretty sure
it glowed, but..."	
Message	Tohka	"I see... Then why don't we do the same thing we
did this morning?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, yeah! Great idea, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I am glad I could be of help!	
Message	Shido	"A-All right! Then first, could you go
to the other side?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I'll go right now!	
Message	Tohka	Heeey! Shido! I'm here!	
Message	Shido	Does anything look different?	
Message	None	"(There are still quite a few people. The tower
still seems to be open to visitors.)"	
Message	None	"(Hmm, where's Tohka...?
Whoa, when did she get next to the monument?!)"	
Message	Shido	Heeey, Tohka! Does anything look strange?	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...? Hmm? There doesn't seem to be anything!	
Message	Shido	"Hmmm, I feel like it was around this time this
morning... All right, I'll try getting closer!"	
Message	Shido	I see... For now, I'll try getting closer.	
Message	Tohka	How about now, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"I don't see anything strange... Maybe I really
was just imagining things this morning...?"	
Message	Shido	No... I'll try checking that red orb first...	
Message	Shido	"I don't see anything strange...
Maybe I really was just imagining things...?"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Get away!!	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Tohka	Ahh! Wh-What is going on...?!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the hell is that?!	
Message	Tohka	...Hmph! Who are you?!	
Message	???	......	
Message	Tohka	―Ngh!	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Are you okay?!	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah! It just barely missed my feet!
What about you, Tohka?!"	
Message	Tohka	"I'm fine! They are attacking!
Shido! Put more distance between us!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right!	
Message	???	......	
Message	Shido	"Th-That attack came out of nowhere!
What's up with that person? And where are we?!"	
Message	Tohka	Calm down, Shido! The enemy wants you to panic!	
Message	Shido	Th-The enemy...?!	
Message	???	......	
Message	Tohka	Hm! They're following us!	
Message	Shido	Wh-Why are we being targeted?!	
Message	Tohka	"It's no use... With this...!
At this rate... I can't protect Shido...!"	
Message	Shido	Tohka...?!	
Message	Tohka	Sandalphon...!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! An attack is coming! Stay back!	
Message	Shido	―Huh?	
Message	???	......	
Message	Tohka	Hmph!	
Message	Tohka	"...If that is how you are going to be, then I will
not hold back, either!!"	
Message	???	......	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey! Why are you attacking us?!
If we can just talk―"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Don't move forward!	
Message	Shido	Yikes―!	
Message	Tohka	―Tch! Hah!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Are you hurt?!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, Tohka! I'm fine!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! I cannot sense any consciousness from them!
It is no use trying to reason!"	
Message	Shido	N-No consciousness?	
Message	Tohka	Yes! So Shido, stay behind me quietly!	
Message	Shido	I-I got it! But... b-be careful!	
Message	Tohka	Do not worry! I will end this! Sandalphon!	
Message	Shido	Ah... The power...!	
Message	???	......	
Message	Tohka	Why, you...! FALL!	
Message	None	"(Tohka's final strike with Sandalphon destroyed
the enemy's incoming attack, and both bodies
were blown back by the explosion.)"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Ngh...	
Message	Shido	Tohka! A-Are you okay?!	
Message	Tohka	D-Do not worry... I will recover soon...	
Message	Shido	That's good...	
Message	Tohka	It seems you're fine too, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Yeah... Thanks. You saved me, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	I-I... am not a regular maiden, after all...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Tohka	I-It's nothing...!	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Shido	"Still, what was that just now? It looks like the
people around us haven't noticed at all..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... I believe the place where we fought was not
here."	
Message	Shido	Somewhere not here?	
Message	Tohka	"When that rock shone, I felt a very strong power.
It must have been then when..."	
Message	Shido	We were sent somewhere else?	
Message	Tohka	"Or... It's possible that we were the only ones
trapped inside a barrier, or something
similar to it."	
Message	Shido	A barrier...?!	
Message	None	"(Could it possibly have something to do with the
same person who created a barrier around
Tengu City?)"	
Message	None	"(But this time, we didn't just get trapped.
We were attacked as well...)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Tohka... What do you think this enemy's
objective is? Our lives?"	
Message	Tohka	I don't know... but...	
Message	Shido	But...?	
Message	Tohka	That attack just now may have been a warning.	
Message	Shido	A warning?	
Message	Tohka	"It would be terrible if something happened to you.
But... couldn't they have attacked more violently?
I felt as if they were deliberately holding back."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?!	
Message	Tohka	"I don't know the reason why... but that entity
seemed to only wish for us not to get closer."	
Message	Shido	"Which means... there's some secret they don't want
us to find here... Is that it?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... It is too complicated to
know for sure, but..."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	"(Now that I think of it, the moment they
disappeared, I felt the same way as when Tohka
and the others' Astral Dress disappears.)"	
Message	None	(Was it a Spirit? No... I don't know...)	
Message	None	"(If it were, we should have been able to
communicate... There would be room
for a discussion... But...)"	
Message	None	"(I'll report this to Kotori and
have her investigate.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	"Tohka... I'm sorry. Our date's over for tonight.
It's a shame that we can't go up to the viewing
platform, but I have to report this to Kotori..."	
Message	Tohka	Y-You are right...	
Message	Shido	"But I was right to ask you to come with me, Tohka.
If I were alone, I wouldn't have been able to do
anything against that entity."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	"Y-Yes...
Then... Let us head home..."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Wait up...!	
Message	Shido	"...So that's what happened. Thanks to Tohka,
we were somehow able to get back safely."	
Message	Kotori	...And?	
Message	Shido	Er, well... There's not much else besides that...	
Message	Kotori	"You think it's all okay because
it turned out fine?"	
Message	Kotori	Don't kid around with me, you idiot!	
Message	Shido	Oof...!	
Message	Kotori	"What do you think you're doing on your own without
telling me?! What were you going to do if
something had happened?!"	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to make you worry, but..."	
Message	Kotori	"Do you understand your own situation?!
You don't have the Flame of Healing right now!
I've told you that time and again!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... I know I'm totally at fault.	
Message	Kotori	"Well... Most importantly, it's good
that you're safe..."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	We'll investigate the monument right away, but...	
Message	Kotori	"Because of your reckless actions, there's a
chance the Spirits might go berserk. Next
time, be sure to consult with me."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I promise I'll do that.	
Message	Kotori	"As long as you know. The barrier covering Tengu
City seems related to this, but we won't know
until we get some results."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I'll leave it to you.	
Message	Kotori	"I hope you'll make some progress, then. Leave
the situation to us. Shido, you just continue
looking after the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, got it...
