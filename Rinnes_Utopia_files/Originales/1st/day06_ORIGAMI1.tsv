Message	None	"(All right! I'm an hour early for our meeting.
Origami's the type that comes early,
so this is...!)"	
Message	None	(I-Is that her standing there...?)	
Message	None	"(In front of the station is a statue that looks
just like the Chuken Hachiko, but people
refer to it as the Chuken Pachiko.)"	
Message	None	"(To the statue's left, wearing a sleeveless
turtleneck and a mini-skirt, was a stoic girl,
standing completely still. It was Origami.)"	
Message	None	(Just how early did she come?!)	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Origami!	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"You're here already? You're even earlier than
I thought you'd be. Don't tell me you've been
waiting for a while."	
Message	Origami	I just arrived.	
Message	None	(I doubted that very much, but I played along.)	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. Um, so for today's date, why don't we
see a movie?"	
Message	Shido	Remember, the one you told me about before?	
Message	Origami	"Yes. It was the day you were also on a date with
Tohka Yatogami."	
Message	Shido	*grunt*! Sorry... That was a crazy day.	
Message	None	"(That day, I had to go on three dates at the
same time. I barely made it out alive.)"	
Message	Origami	"It's fine. You had your reasonings. It couldn't
be helped. What matters is today's date, not
the past."	
Message	Shido	Yup. Point taken.	
Message	Origami	"Promise me something. You're going to be here
with me, and you won't go anywhere else."	
Message	Shido	Mm. Got it! I promise. Let's go.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(We walked in the direction of Tengu Cinema,
which was close to the train station.)"	
Message	Shido	Um, Origami-san? What are you doing?	
Message	Origami	Locking arms with you.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Thought so.	
Message	None	"(Since it's a date, locking arms is normal.
But I can feel Origami's chest on my arm, and
it makes me sweat uncontrollably.)"	
Message	Origami	Are you hot?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	You're sweating profusely.	
Message	Shido	"Um. Yeah, it's hot, I guess. It is summer after
all. Aha. Ahahaha..."	
Message	Origami	"I see. Should we hurry? The movie theater will
be cool."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	None	(It's Saturday. Just as I thought, it's packed.)	
Message	Shido	Oh, Origami. Mind if I choose the movie?	
Message	Origami	"I don't mind. As long as I'm with you, I can
see anything."	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. Cool. Then, I'm going to buy the tickets,
so you can pick out the refreshments."	
Message	Origami	Roger.	
Message	None	"(I already researched what to watch. I know
which tickets to buy.)"	
Message	None	"(Origami's smart, so I think it's better to
watch a comedy.)"	
Message	None	"(I got in line for the box office, and got two
tickets.)"	
Message	None	"(It's a hilarious comedy called "Mister Norman,"
so this should be great.)"	
Message	None	"(We'll watch a dumb flick together and be a
normal couple. Laughing together, crying
together. This'll make up for last time!)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami! Sorry for the wait.	
Message	Origami	No problem. I purchased our drinks and snacks.	
Message	Shido	"Right on. I hear they're letting people in
already, so let's head inside."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(Alone with Origami. Although our row was
relatively far in the back, we found a couple of
seats in the center and watched "Mister Norman.")"	
Message	None	"(From the get-go, people laughed their butts
off, but Origami didn't react at all. Maybe if
we keep watching...)"	
Message	None	"(As the end credits rolled, people in the
audience began discussing the movie amongst
themselves. I thought it was hilarious.)"	
Message	None	"(I kept an eye on Origami throughout the movie,
but she didn't snicker even once. She only moved
during the two-hour movie to sip her drink.)"	
Message	None	"(I've no idea if Origami had a good time or not,
but we followed the rest of the audience out to
hit the lobby.)"	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?	
Message	Origami	Mm...?	
Message	Shido	Um, how'd you like the movie? Did you like it?	
Message	Origami	It was fun. Very fun.	
Message	None	"(Whoa? Did she say "very"? Why didn't it
seem like she had fun?)"	
Message	Shido	"I see... You didn't seem to enjoy it much, so
I thought I picked the wrong movie."	
Message	Origami	"The movie itself was fine, but next time, a
horror movie would be more entertaining."	
Message	Shido	What?! Origami, you like horror movies?	
Message	Origami	"Not necessarily, but horror movies give me
more chances..."	
Message	Shido	Chances?	
Message	Origami	"Horror movies are packed with jump scares.
Therefore, I could jump on you when I'm startled."	
Message	Shido	Seriously?	
Message	Origami	Not your thing?	
Message	Shido	No, it's not that. Anyways, let's get out of here.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(*sigh*... Guess a comedy wasn't the right
choice. I was so confident...)"	
Message	None	(Well, I guess it's not that simple. *sigh*...)	
Message	None	"(Origami and I trotted through the shopping
district towards the path to Takadai Park.)"	
Message	None	"(On our walk, I contemplated more ways
I could make Origami smile.)"	
Message	None	"(However, I don't think it's something I can
do in a snap. Decisions, decisions...)"	
Message	None	"(Will Origami not rest until the Spirits are
destroyed? Has time stopped for her...?)"	
Message	None	"(That can't be, but... what else could I do for
her?)"	
Message	None	"(Crap! Origami's right next to me, and I've
been so quiet because I've been stuck in my
head.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"Is something stressing you out? You don't
seem to be having fun."	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry...	
Message	Origami	Should I take your apology as an admission?	
Message	Shido	No, it's not that.	
Message	Origami	Are you not having fun with me?	
Message	Shido	I didn't say that!	
Message	Origami	It's written on your face.	
Message	Shido	...! Well, right back at you!	
Message	Origami	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"I wanted to make you smile, so I took you to
a funny movie, but you never laughed once, so..."	
Message	Origami	"Even if I didn't smile, I enjoyed watching the
movie with you. I was content. Is that not
enough?"	
Message	Shido	! That's not... It's not, but...!	
Message	Origami	But...?	
Message	Shido	No, sorry. I was acting selfish...	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	"Being with you makes me happy. I feel safe.
I always enjoy spending time with you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	But I can't smile...	
Message	Shido	Is it because of the Spirits...?	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	"If you wait for me, after I've vanquished the
Spirits, I—"	
Message	Shido	You can't do that!	
Message	Origami	"Why? The Spirits. Are you attached to those
monsters?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Origami	I do not understand...	
Message	Shido	It's true that Spirits pose some danger, but—	
Message	Origami	"The Spirits have taken everything dear to me.
My father, my mother, and now... Shido."	
Message	Shido	"The Spirits haven't stolen me. You're dear to
me too, Origami!"	
Message	Origami	Then choose me over the Spirits!	
Message	Shido	...I-I can't do that.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	I don't want to hurt Tohka, either.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"I know I'm being selfish, but as much as it
means something to you—maybe even more—
I don't want you to hurt anyone..."	
Message	Shido	"So if you're planning to fight the Spirits, I
have to stop you."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Origami, there's kindness in you. You're smart,
true to yourself. Sure, you've got your flaws,
but the real you is considerate of others."	
Message	Shido	How could you be fine with hurting others?!	
Message	Origami	That's untrue. You're overestimating me.	
Message	Shido	No, it's true. I know it is.	
Message	Origami	No, it's not. Do not put words in my mouth.	
Message	Shido	"So you're telling me you don't feel anything
when you're fighting a Spirit?! When you
hurt them?!"	
Message	Origami	My heart feels nothing.	
Message	Shido	That's a lie!	
Message	Origami	No, it's not!	
Message	Shido	Why are you so stubborn?!	
Message	Origami	What?! Th-That's because you...	
Message	Shido	Don't put this on me!	
Message	Origami	"I... I hate the Spirits! That's why I joined the
AST! To defeat them... To avenge the murder
of my parents!"	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	"This is all... I've lived for! Since that fateful
day, five years ago!"	
Message	Origami	"So, until I've enacted my vengeance, I cannot
laugh. No, I mustn't laugh!"	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	If you so wish, Shido... I, too, want to smile.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"I want to smile. I promise to try, for you...
Only for you."	
Message	Shido	That's not it, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Origami, you have to smile for yourself.	
Message	Shido	And I'll do anything to make that happen.	
Message	Shido	"I mean, you joined AST... because you didn't
want anyone to suffer like you have, right?"	
Message	Origami	...!	
Message	Shido	"Right? That's how selfless you are. I just
don't think you should suppress your smile
anymore."	
Message	Shido	So, Origami, I won't ever give up, okay?	
Message	Origami	Shido...
