Message	Shido	Phew. I wonder if Origami is still around...	
Message	Shido	I ran away from her earlier, but that wasn't nice.	
Message	Shido	What can I do to go on a legitimate date with her?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Seems like someone's still here.	
Message	Shido	OH?!	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?! You're still here?	
Message	Origami	Did you forget something, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Well... no, I didn't, but... um...
I was kinda looking for you. Wait,
why are you still here?"	
Message	Origami	Nothing really.	
Message	Shido	Why are you crouched by my desk?	
Message	Origami	I just felt... dizzy.	
Message	Shido	Is my chair... wet?	
Message	Origami	It's June. There's a lot of humidity.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... there is?	
Message	Origami	Yeah.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Um...	
Message	Origami	?	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami... do you have a minute?	
Message	Origami	I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	Huh? I didn't ask you anything yet...	
Message	Origami	You came to ask me a favor, right?	
Message	Shido	Oh! W-Well, yeah, but...	
Message	Origami	So, what do you want to do? No one's here.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Just be gentle.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami! You're too close!	
Message	Shido	I-I feel like you may have the wrong idea.	
Message	Origami	Oh, dear me.	
Message	Shido	F-Finally... you get it.	
Message	Shido	What?! W-Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Stop!	
Message	Origami	What's going on?	
Message	Shido	What?! That's what I should be asking you!	
Message	Origami	"I feel bad for not understanding what it is
you want exactly. But I understand now.
We won't have any more problems."	
Message	Shido	"S-STOOOOP! You keep making more problems!
Don't move! Just stay put!"	
Message	Origami	Huh? Oh, is that how you want to play?	
Message	Shido	"A girl shouldn't be saying things like that!
Listen, Origami, just calm down and put your
clothes back on. We can talk after that!"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(I wonder if she's not moving because I told
her to stay put. She's being weirdly obedient.)"	
Message	Shido	"O-Origami? You can move now, so please...
put your clothes back on. Please?"	
Message	Origami	Oh.	
Message	Shido	"U-Um... Origami, the favor I wanted to ask you...
was that I wanted to go... on a date with you!"	
Message	Origami	A date? With me?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Do you not want to?	
Message	Origami	There's no reason I would decline.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, is that so? That's great. Okay...
is there somewhere you'd like to go?"	
Message	Origami	Not really.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. I guess... um...	
Message	None	"(It's kind of hard to have an answer when you're
put on the spot like that, huh?)"	
Message	Origami	But, if I had to pick a spot, I'd pick... here.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"As long as you're with me, here is just fine.
When the two of us are alone, it's pretty much
just like a date."	
Message	Shido	...! I-I guess...	
Message	None	"(Is she really okay just hanging out here?
I guess if she's okay, it's fine by me...)"	
Message	Origami	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	You seem uncomfortable.	
Message	Shido	Well, um.	
Message	Origami	"If you want to continue where we left off,
we can get back immediately."	
Message	Shido	"NO! NO, NO, NO! I-I'm just happy with getting
to spend time and talk with you, Origami! I can't
do anything when Tengu City is in such horrible—"	
Message	Origami	Horrible what?	
Message	Shido	Oh!	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	None	"(C-Crap! I panicked and the words slipped
right out of my mouth!!)"	
Message	Origami	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	Well, um...	
Message	Origami	If you're not going to tell me, I'll ask your bod—	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I'll tell you.	
Message	Origami	...I see.	
Message	Shido	W-Why do you look so sad?	
Message	Origami	Nothing.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(I don't think it's good to spread this information,
but I feel like I can't help it now.)"	
Message	None	(If I say something random, she'll see right through me.)	
Message	Shido	"Y-You see... I heard that Tengu City has been
involved in something big."	
Message	Origami	Details.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't know much about it. Rather,
maybe it's better that I say I don't know."	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Shido	"Supposedly, a huge amount of Spirit waves have been
seen throughout the city... and there's this big
barrier around the town I guess..."	
Message	Origami	Barrier?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Maybe because of that, Tohka and the others'
Spirit powers are unstable. We don't know when they'll
go rogue."	
Message	Origami	The Spirits go rogue?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I still don't know why, but... all I know is that
it's not good."	
Message	Origami	I almost can't believe that. I haven't heard about that.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... huh.	
Message	Origami	Shido, why did you ask me on a date?	
Message	Shido	Huh? W-Well, I was worried about you, Origami...	
Message	Origami	Me?	
Message	Shido	You're kind of in a weird place right now, right?	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Well... they might fire you from the AST, right?	
Message	Origami	...I don't know yet.	
Message	Shido	I-I see.	
Message	Origami	"Maybe the reason why my punishment is on hold...
has something to do with what you mentioned, Shido."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Origami	"There's no way that the AST could not catch
Spirit waves of that scale."	
Message	Origami	"I'm sure they're trying to find a countermeasure.
To prevent total chaos, they're withholding information
and trying to deal with it in secret."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Origami	"I may have made an intense breach, but my home
suspension was lifted and my official punishment
has been put on hold. I'm wondering about that."	
Message	Origami	"I can't go in and out of the base freely, but I wasn't
forbidden from using the realizer. They just told me to
refrain. Maybe they're keeping me in case of an emergency."	
Message	Shido	Y-You think the AST figured something out?	
Message	Origami	Do you want to know?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, of course. If Tohka and the girls going rogue
is related to the barrier in Tengu City, I want to try
and resolve it."	
Message	Origami	Is that so?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Origami	"Thanks for sharing that. I'm starting to see the bigger
picture regarding the current position I'm in."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. Well... uh, I guess that's... good.	
Message	Origami	Good.	
Message	Shido	"(Origami seems relieved. It was probably
a good thing that I talked to her.)"
