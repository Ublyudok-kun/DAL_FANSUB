Message	Tohka	Shido, I do not know if I should go on a date.	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, you promised me yesterday that you'd
go on one with me."	
Message	Tohka	"But I do not think I have the right to...
I feel strange."	
Message	Shido	"Right, but that's not important. What do you
mean you feel strange?"	
Message	Tohka	"It's my heart. I'm finding it difficult to
breathe."	
Message	None	(Hm. This isn't good.)	
Message	None	"(Last night, Tohka was up all night worrying
about Rinne. I wonder if she's gotten stuck
in her head and lost confidence from it.)"	
Message	None	"(What could I do to make Tohka feel better?
What would she do...?)"	
Message	Shido	OH! I know. Why didn't I think of it sooner?	
Message	Tohka	Huh?	
Message	None	"(I hugged Tohka from behind. I can feel her
warmth.)"	
Message	Tohka	"SH...SH-SH-SH-SH-SHIDO?!
What's the matter?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, uh... Th-This is... I'm copying you, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	M-Me?!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Whenever I'm stressed, this is what you
do for me."	
Message	Shido	"This time, it's my turn. Whenever you're down,
or stuck in a rut, I'll be here for you. Don't
worry."	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... You're warm.	
Message	Shido	So are you, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Really?	
Message	Shido	Yup.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, I feel better.	
Message	Shido	Are you sure?	
Message	Tohka	Yes. Thanks to you, worlds better.	
Message	Shido	Gotcha! Well, that's a relief.	
Message	Tohka	Thank you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"No need to thank me. That's what friends are
for."	
Message	Tohka	Indeed!	
Message	Shido	"All right. Now, about that date.
Let's go, Tohka!"	
Message	Tohka	Whoa! W-Wait, Shido! Where are we going?	
Message	Shido	Follow me!	
Message	Tohka	NUWAAA!	
Message	Shido	Okay, we're here!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? This is the shopping district.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that's right.	
Message	Tohka	Mmm. As usual, it smells incredible!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka. Let's grab a bite over there.	
Message	Tohka	Hm?! Wait, Shido!	
Message	Shido	What? Don't you want to eat?	
Message	Tohka	No, of course I do, but I brought no mon—	
Message	Shido	"I'll spot you, so don't fret. Pay me back with
your smile."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? My smile? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"I want you to be your typical self. Come on.
Let's go."	
Message	Tohka	Oh... Oh, I see! Then, let's!	
Message	Shido	A-AH! HOT! *blow, blow*...!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! Did you burn yourself? Takoyaki are
normally hot, so please use caution."	
Message	Shido	"I know, but I love the heat. Come on, Tohka.
It'll get colder the longer you stare at it."	
Message	Tohka	Mm?! Oh, of course.	
Message	Tohka	Mmm... *blow*! *blow, blow*! *blow, blow*!	
Message	Shido	What do you think?	
Message	Tohka	Yes! It's best hot!	
Message	Shido	"Right? Okay, let's eat the rest before it cools
down."	
Message	Tohka	Understood!	
Message	Tohka	OH! HA! *blow, blow*! *blow, blow*!	
Message	Shido	"Here you go. I bought some mixed kebab
sandwiches."	
Message	Tohka	Wow! Such exotic spices!	
Message	Tohka	All right, Shido! I shall dig in.	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	Tohka	*nom*...	
Message	Tohka	Mmm. The flavors are exquisite.	
Message	Tohka	"The slightly-charred meat is brimming
with spice."	
Message	Shido	"Yup, it's packed with meat and veggies, so
it's probably nutritious too."	
Message	Tohka	Yes. Exa—*nom*! Mmgmg! Yeah... *cough*!	
Message	Shido	You okay, Tohka? Are you choking?	
Message	Tohka	All fine. Just got a bit carried away.	
Message	Shido	"I see. I'm happy you're okay. We still have
a long way to go."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Long way to go?	
Message	Shido	Next is... that shop, over there! Let's hit it!	
Message	Tohka	Oh, h-hey! Shido! Wait!	
Message	Tohka	The shopping district is simply enormous!	
Message	Shido	"Yup. Plenty of exotic food for you to eat,
Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What's the matter? You look uncomfortable.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I ate too much, so I should take a breather.
Ready to go now?"	
Message	Tohka	Okay. Wherever you go, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Then let's go! Come on!	
Message	Tohka	Whoa! Where are you taking me, Shido?	
Message	Tohka	WOW! So this is an arcade!	
Message	Shido	"Yep, it's a perfect way to kill time. Oh...
What's that? Tohka! Come here!"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Look. A claw machine. They just got a new one.
Doesn't that one look like Yoshinon?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm. You're right. How adorable.	
Message	Shido	Okay, gonna give it a whirl!	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What? You want one of those toys,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, for sure. You want one too, don't you,
Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! I want one too!	
Message	Shido	Sure, here I go!	
Message	Tohka	Okay! Best of luck, Shido!	
Message	None	"(Although I talked a big game by telling her
I'd win one for her, I wasn't too successful,
and my funds were running low...)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido...	
Message	Shido	I-It's fine. Just getting warmed up.	
Message	None	(First, I need to slide the crane to the side...)	
Message	None	(Move it upwards a bit, and aim!)	
Message	Shido	Yes, got it!	
Message	Shido	OH?!	
Message	Tohka	Huh?!	
Message	None	"(The plush doll hanging from the crane
rolled over at the perfect time, pushing
the one next to it down into the chute.)"	
Message	Shido	Hehehe... HAHAHAHA! I... We are victorious!	
Message	Tohka	Amazing, Shido! You captured two!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Totally worth the wait, huh? Here you go,
Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	"Mm...! Stupendous! We each get one!
We match!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It was a labor of love, so be sure to take
care of it, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I vow to defend this doll with my heart!	
Message	None	"(All right. Now that's how you make an
impression. Where should we go next?)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Tohka? We spent quite a bit of time at
the arcade. Are you getting hungry?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm... Truthfully, I was never full.	
Message	Shido	Haha... Okay, let's get something to eat.	
Message	Tohka	"I have no doubt the next destination will be
great too."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, trust me.	
Message	Shido	Aiya... The bread shop's closed already.	
Message	Tohka	Oh, were you thinking of getting kinako bread?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. That's what I planned, but I guess we
lost track of time at the arcade. Hm. What
would Tohka want to ea—?"	
Message	Tohka	I detect a delicious scent coming from close by.	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're right.	
Message	Tohka	Mm...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's up, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"Although we couldn't purchase kinako bread,
something else has grabbed my attention.
They must still be open, right?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Yeah, I think so.	
Message	Tohka	Very well. Let's hurry, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Tohka! Hey, wait a minute!	
Message	None	(She's sprinting so fast!)	
Message	Shido	I can't keep up, Tohka!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka! Wait for me!	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, ho. So this is where the scent was coming
from."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, you smelled the crepes, huh? You've
got a sharp nose."	
Message	Tohka	Hm... They look irresistible! *drool*...!	
Message	Shido	Should we get one?	
Message	Tohka	...Really?!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I was hoping to buy kinako bread for
dessert, but this works too."	
Message	Tohka	I see! Then, I'll dig right in!	
Message	Tohka	"Interesting... This is a crepe. It has a similar
texture to the pita bread."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I could see that. Crepes are sweet, though.	
Message	Tohka	"Yes. The sweetness stimulates me differently
than the kinako bread."	
Message	Shido	Haha. Hear, hear. Enjoy.	
Message	Tohka	Okay! Don't mind if I do! *nom, nom*!	
Message	Tohka	Mmm! Wh-Whoaaaa!	
Message	Shido	What's the matter, Tohka? Did it taste funny?	
Message	Tohka	DELICIOUS! Sweet and tantalizing!	
Message	Shido	I see, I see. Glad you like it. Oh, hey!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Tohka, you got cream on your face.	
Message	Tohka	Hm...?	
Message	Shido	"Ah, stop, stop! Don't move! If you wipe it
with your sleeve, it'll get your shirt dirty!"	
Message	Shido	Here. Stay still, face me.	
Message	Tohka	S-Sorry...	
Message	Shido	You're welcome.	
Message	Tohka	*gasp*! Oh...!	
Message	Shido	Hm? What now?	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido, what's going on...?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Tohka	Hm! This date...!	
Message	Shido	Uh huh.	
Message	Tohka	"All of the places you took me today... were
the same as our previous date."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's right. I had so much fun with you
that day, so I thought it'd be just as fun a
second time."	
Message	None	(That day, Tohka smiled so much.)	
Message	Tohka	"Shido. I just noticed, but you are not enjoying
this as much as I am, are you?"	
Message	Shido	That's not true.	
Message	Tohka	"It is true! Shido, you wish to make me happy,
right? But all I bring is trouble—"	
Message	Shido	That's not true!	
Message	Tohka	...?!	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, you being you... is all I want to see.
That's my ideal date."	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido...	
Message	Shido	Tohka, I love seeing you excited when you eat!	
Message	Tohka	"Mm... I see. But if you date me, then I would
end up dragging you to many places."	
Message	Shido	That's okay. I'll go wherever you go, Princess.	
Message	Tohka	"...?! But I have a voracious appetite, and I'm
loud!"	
Message	Shido	Even so, my mind wouldn't change.	
Message	Tohka	Can you prepare yourself?	
Message	Shido	"Yup. I'm ready, but it'd be nice if you go easy
on me at first."	
Message	Tohka	A-And...!	
Message	Shido	There's more?	
Message	Tohka	Thank you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	No problem.	
Message	None	(Seems like... today's date was a success.)	
Message	None	"(Tohka's smile... returned. That alone fulfills
me.)"	
Message	Shido	Haha. I see...	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Nothing.	
Message	None	(Now I know. This is what makes me happy.)
