Message	Shido	Oh, Tohka! Wait a sec.	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	I'd completely forgotten.	
Message	Tohka	?	
Message	Shido	"The offering for the Tengu Cow... we haven't bought it
yet, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh! That was so careless of us!	
Message	Shido	I'll go buy it now. What will you do, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Right! If it were with you Shido, I would go anywhere!	
Message	None	(...!)	
Message	None	"(Tohka really has a way of rattling these
things that make my heart pound...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Should we make the offering
something the Tengu Cow likes?"	
Message	Shido	"You're right... what to do? For something like
this, maybe some kind of food is ideal."	
Message	Tohka	So this Tengu Cow has an appetite, huh?	
Message	Shido	"Haha, it might... alright, let's head back to
the shopping district and buy something!"	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, it would be good if there's something
the Tengu Cow would be pleased with!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I agree.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Tohka, sushi can't be it, right?
It's not like we can't get it wrapped,
but... Wait. Huh?!"	
Message	Shido	Tohka?	
Message	None	She was just here a second ago... she's gone?!	
Message	None	(Gah! I only looked away for a second. Where'd she run off to?)	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tohkaaa? Tohkaaaa?! Where are you?!	
Message	None	(Dang, I've completely lost sight of her.)	
Message	Shido	Reine-san?	
Message	Reine	"Shin, has something happened to Tohka?"	
Message	Shido	Ohh, Reine-san. I'm sorry, we got separated while shopping...	
Message	Reine	"Hm. So that's why her stress level has risen."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Reine	"Shin, hurry and find Tohka, and calm her down."	
Message	Shido	"Well, of course I'm all for doing that, but...
is there any way you can see where Tohka
went on your end, Reine-san?"	
Message	Reine	"It is currently impossible to verify her location
with my equipment, and we're also short-staffed.
The best I can do is analyze her mental status."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Reine	"Alternatively, if you consider Tohka's thought
process, perhaps you will find the answer."	
Message	Shido	Her thought process?	
Message	Reine	"What would Tohka do in this situation?
Consider this while thinking about what to do."	
Message	Reine	Good luck, Shin.	
Message	Shido	Hm... what would Tohka do?	
Choice		Tohka would get hooked by the scent of food and head to food shops	
Choice		Tohka would return to look for me	
Message	None	"(Well, we are talking about the ravenous Tohka.
She must have followed a tantalizing food smell
while thinking about an offering for the Tengu Cow.)"	
Message	None	(What sort of offering would Tohka pick for the Tengu Cow?)	
Message	None	"(Hm... I don't know. Either way, I'll make sure to check
the restaurants during my search.)"	
Message	Cake Shop Worker	Welcome!	
Message	Shido	Um...	
Message	Cake Shop Worker	Yes, may I help you?	
Message	Shido	Oh! Um... did a girl with long black hair come in here?	
Message	Cake Shop Worker	I'm not sure...I don't think I've seen a girl like that...	
Message	Shido	I-I see! Sorry to trouble you.	
Message	Cake Shop Worker	Ah, don't even worry about it. Come back soon!	
Message	None	"(Since I'm here already, I think I'll buy a slice of cake.
It might be a waste to use as an offering, but...)"	
Message	Shido	"U-Umm, sorry to bother you again, but could I get a
slice of cake, please? This short cake right here."	
Message	Cake Shop Worker	One slice of the short cake comin' right up!	
Message	None	(Dang, my hunch was wrong...)	
Message	None	"(Oh well. Nothing I can do about that now.
I just have to keep looking.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Rgh! Not like that! You don't need to cut it!
Just give me the whole thing!"	
Message	Kebab Shop Worker	Oh, I'm sorry... I'm not selling it like this...	
Message	None	(Tohka?)	
Message	Shido	Tohka! There you are!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! I found it! It's the offering for the Tengu Cow!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	"We must buy that rotating meat, Shido!
Isn't that perfect?"	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Kebab Shop Worker	I'm sorry, miss... but this is...	
Message	None	"(The kebab stand owner shrugged their shoulders,
then looked towards me with a pained expression.)"	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Tohka	"Hm, what is wrong, Shido?
I'm sure that the Tengu Cow will take a liking to this."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, I know... I understand what you're thinking, Tohka, but...	
Message	Tohka	?	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka. Let's just go away for a moment... over here.	
Message	Tohka	Hm... what's wrong?	
Message	None	"(Hm, it'd be bad if we got separated because I went to
look for her, so I guess I'll wait here...)"	
Message	Tohka	Heeey! Shido!	
Message	None	S-She really did come back... I'm glad I waited.	
Message	Tohka	"What are you spacing out for?
I found the offering for the Tengu Cow!"	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Tohka	Let us hurry! Over here!	
Message	Shido	W-Wait a second!	
Message	Tohka	Look, Shido! Let's buy that!	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	None	"Tohka pointed to a giant hunk of meat
being spit-roasted... Huh? That whole thing?"	
Message	None	"The kebab stand owner shrugged his shoulders,
then looked towards me with a pained expression."	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Tohka	Hm, how is it Shido? I'm sure he would be very pleased with this!	
Message	None	"I mean, it does sort of feel like an offering,
but it's a little ridiculous..."	
Message	Shido	Tohka, let's step aside for a moment... over here.	
Message	Tohka	?	
Message	Shido	I-It was a pretty good thought, Tohka, but...	
Message	Tohka	Yes! With that meat, the Tengu Cow will surely be satisfied!	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah...I'm sure, but that meat's not something that
can be sold in the first place. I mean, it can be,
but not like that, you know?"	
Message	Shido	"Even if he were to sell it to us, I don't have enough
money on hand to buy such a large piece of meat."	
Message	Tohka	Is that so?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm sorry, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	"N-No, it's nothing for you to apologize for, Shido!
I wasn't thinking it through... I should apologize."	
Message	Shido	Then... why don't you make your offering a kebab, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"Oh! That's a wonderful idea!
It might not be quite enough for the Tengu Cow,
but with something so delicious, I'm sure it'll smile!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right?	
Message	Tohka	"Alright, I've decided on that for my offering!
Let's hurry and return, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	Right. Don't rush too much and trip, okay?	
Message	Tohka	Alright!
