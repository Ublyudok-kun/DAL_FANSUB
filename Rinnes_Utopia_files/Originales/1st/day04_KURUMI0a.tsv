Message	Shido	"I'm going alone to school for the first time
in a while."	
Message	Shido	"Seems like both Tohka and Kotori are heading
to the Fraxinus. Man, the days are so hectic."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	My, Shido-san. Good morning.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...? Did you just come out of the alley?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. What of it?	
Message	Shido	"I heard they caught a pervert there. It's
dangerous, so I suggest you stay away."	
Message	Kurumi	My, are you concerned for my safety?	
Message	Shido	Uh... I-It's not like that!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, very well. How unfortunate.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	"I was under the impression you cared,
Shido-san, but it appears not to be true.
I think I'm on the verge of tears."	
Message	Shido	"What? Wait, what? I guess if the pervert ran
into you, he'd be in big danger."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe...	
Message	Shido	"If I continue talking to you, I'll be late! Sorry,
I gotta get going."	
Message	Kurumi	"Okay. I won't keep you. The student's true duty
is to his studies. Have a nice day."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Later!	
Message	Kurumi	...Hehe.
