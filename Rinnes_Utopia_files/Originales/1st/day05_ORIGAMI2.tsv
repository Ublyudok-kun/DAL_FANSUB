Message	None	"(All right! I was able to schedule an outdoor
date with Origami!)"	
Message	None	"(B-But that still leaves the question of where
I should take her...)"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	(Hm. I have to make sure she has a good time!)	
Message	None	"(We can start by heading to the shopping district,
and maybe window-shop?)"	
Message	None	"(Oh, but... what would Origami like? I guess
I could ask her, but I could imagine her not
having much to respond with.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Origami? Would you like to visit any
particular shop?"	
Message	Origami	Yes.	
Message	Shido	"I know, you probably can't think of anything,
right? I thought so—WHAT?!"	
Message	Shido	Y-You do?	
Message	Origami	There's a place I frequent.	
Message	Shido	You frequent?	
Message	Origami	"I wanted to replenish my stock of scented
candles. Seems like they worked last time."	
Message	None	"(Scented candles... Oh, the ones she lit at her
house, huh? The ones that made my brain melt
from relaxation. They're legal, right...?)"	
Message	Shido	I-I see... So where is this shop?	
Message	Origami	"It's in a back alley of the shopping district.
There's a sign above it, named "Jako"."	
Message	None	"(Ja...Jako? Is that what it's called? It sounds
wicked, but... isn't that an omen?)"	
Message	Shido	Um. Well, I guess stopping by couldn't hurt?	
Message	Origami	Mm...	
Message	Origami	Oh, sorry Shido.	
Message	Shido	It's fine. It may be something important.	
Message	Origami	Mm... nng... ng...	
Message	Origami	Hello...	
Message	Origami	Huh? ...The Spirit? Roger!	
Message	Shido	Origami! You just said Spirit—	
Message	Origami	"Sorry. Something's come up. I promise to make
up for it another time."	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait a minute, Origami! It's a Spirit, right?!
Then, let me go with you!"	
Message	Origami	No. You must get to somewhere safe!	
Message	Shido	...Hey! Origami!	
Message	None	(*grunt*... Wh-What should I do?!)	
Message	None	"(I know, I should contact Kotori! I don't want to
make any rash decisions without her permission.)"	
Message	Shido	Hello, Kotori?	
Message	Reine	"...Shin?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Reine-san?! Why are you...	
Message	Reine	"Kotori is currently preoccupied, and can't come\nto the phone. What's the matter?"	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Um, any chance you guys spotted a
Spirit appearing or anything?"	
Message	Reine	"...A Spirit?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, um... I was in the middle of a date with
Origami, and the AST reached out to her."	
Message	Reine	"Hm. I haven't detected any spacequakes,\nbut perhaps there was a silent quake?"	
Message	Shido	"I haven't heard many details, but I know for
certain that Origami mentioned a Spirit, so
they must've spotted something on the radar."	
Message	Reine	"Hm. Let me confirm. If they were Spirit waves\nfrom the barrier, or related to that "Guardian",\nthere's a chance it's camouflaged. Can you hold?"	
Message	Shido	"But we don't have the luxury of time right now!
I might not catch up to her, but I'm gonna run
after Origami."	
Message	Reine	"...I see. Then I'll tell Kotori."	
Message	Shido	Th-Thank you!	
Message	None	"(I might've spoken too soon. I've completely
lost sight of Origami. What do I do...?)"	
Message	None	"(M-Maybe... I could wait for Reine-san's analysis.
I'm not invincible. If something crazy happens,
who knows what trouble I'll find myself in...)"	
Message	None	(I've made up my mind. I will—!)	
Choice		Wait for Reine's analysis.	
Choice		Run after Origami.	
Message	Shido	"I'll wait for Reine-san's analysis. That way
I can figure out where Origami went and
if it's dangerous, I can consult with her..."	
Message	None	(Be safe until then, Origami!)	
Message	Shido	Hm? Why do I have a bad feeling about this?	
Message	Shido	"Hello? Reine-san?! Did you figure it out already?!
I thought you'd take longer!"	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, I have bad news for you."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Did nothing come up?	
Message	Reine	"I tried entering the mainframe of Tengu Garrison\nto analyze the data on AST's radar, but I just now\nintercepted an unfortunate message."	
Message	Shido	Intercepted...?	
Message	Reine	"...I just confirmed the death\nof Origami Tobiichi."	
Message	Shido	What? Wh-What are you talking about...?	
Message	Reine	"It seems she tried wearing her wiring suit\nin a remote area."	
Message	Reine	"When she ran out into the street, she was run\nover by a truck whose driver was asleep behind\nthe wheel. She never woke up."	
Message	Shido	Haha... You're lying, right?	
Message	Reine	"I overheard she was killed immediately."	
Message	Shido	I-IT'S A LIE!	
Message	Reine	"Although she was rushing to the scene...\nShe suffered an unbefitting end. Most tragic."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What...? I... I... No... I-I... I refuse to
believe it! I can't! Because... Because...
Origami was... just with me! AAH!"	
Message	Reine	"Shin? Shin...? What's the matter, Shin? Answer\nme."	
Message	Shido	O...ri...gami...	
Message	Reine	"Shin, I've sent a relief squad. Hang in there.\nShin, Shin, answer me. Shin."	
Message	None	"(Reine-san's voice gradually faded into the distance...
"	
Message	None	 And everything turned black.)	
Message	Shido	Okay! I'm gonna run after Origami!	
Message	Shido	"She ran in the direction opposite to the station,
but... where exactly did she go?"	
Message	Shido	A-Anyways, I'll just go for it!	
Message	Shido	"*pant*... *pant*... Was it this way? I thought earlier,
I saw Origami coming down from the sky in her suit..."	
Message	Shido	"But if she's fighting a Spirit, this won't end
quietly, will it? Did I make the wrong choice?"	
Message	Shido	"What should I do? It's not like I could call her
during an emergency and ask where she is, too."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Wait, someone's atop the outlet tower...
Isn't that Origami?"	
Message	None	(...Huh? She seems different than usual.)	
Message	Shido	What's going on? Is the battle already over?	
Message	Shido	Hey, Ori...	
Message	None	(?!)	
Message	Origami	*grunt*!	
Message	Shido	O-Ori...gami...?	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Origami	"Shido, why have you come? This mission is
dangerous. If you come, I'll be exposing you
to that danger."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, I was... worried about you, Origami.
But... I'm glad you're safe."	
Message	Origami	False report...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	There was nothing here.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...	
Message	None	"(From my point of view, I'm glad nothing
happened, but... for Origami...)"	
Message	None	"(Did Origami get upset because she wasn't
able to fight a Spirit? Maybe her grudge against
Spirits is... deeper than I ever imagined.)"	
Message	None	"(Is she fighting by herself in this vulnerable
state? Origami is...)"	
Message	Origami	"I cannot accept the abnormality. Investigation,
complete. I am returning."	
Message	Shido	Then, let's head home togethe—	
Message	Shido	What the—?! Th-The outlet tower?!	
Message	Origami	Wha?! Shido, get back.	
Message	Shido	It's back?! That thing's back?!	
Message	Shido	The G-Guardian?!	
Message	Origami	I found you. Protect Territory, engage!	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(The barrier Origami had cast wrapped around
me in an instant.)"	
Message	Shido	"Origami! That's the Spirit that's protecting
the barrier!"	
Message	Origami	Spirit!	
Message	None	"(Well, at least it seems like a Spirit.
If I go off Kotori's information, then it shouldn't
too different from a Spirit.)"	
Message	Origami	Razor Blade! No Pain!	
Message	Origami	Spirits are my enemy, and...	
Message	Origami	You are going to pay for trying to hurt Shido.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...?	
Message	Origami	HU!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Origami	HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Origami	Territory, apply max settings!	
Message	Shido	"Origami! Hold on! Maybe if we fall back,
it won't attack you! Origami, don't try to
fight it on your own!"	
Message	Origami	"If it's a Spirit, I cannot let it go. It also does
not change the fact that it attacked you."	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...?	
Message	Origami	I'm going to end it here. HA!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Origami	I won't let you get away. HA!	
Message	Origami	Territory, release. *pant, pant*... *pant, pant*.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami... A-Are you okay...?	
Message	Origami	No... problem... *pant*...*pant*...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	(I can't explain it.)	
Message	None	"(No, I mean Origami isn't really one to talk,
and there've been plenty of times where it's
silent between us.)"	
Message	None	"(But this time is different. It's hard to explain.
Origami feels so... far away...)"	
Message	None	"(She's next to me, walking beside me, but
how can I explain it...?)"	
Message	None	"(...I've never seen Origami show so much
emotion.)"	
Message	None	"(I've taken her out on dates because I wanted
to become more acquainted with her emotions,
but this isn't quite what I was expecting.)"	
Message	None	"(Sure, life isn't all sunshine and roses for
people. They feel anger, hold grudges, and get
upset. That's natural, but this is different.)"	
Message	None	(...This isn't the Origami I want to see.)	
Message	Origami	...Shido?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Wh-What is it?	
Message	Origami	You've been staring at me.	
Message	Shido	Oh... S-Sorry.	
Message	Origami	It's fine. I'm always looking at you.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh... Haha... Hahaha...	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami?	
Message	Origami	What is it?	
Message	Shido	Um, would you smile for me...?	
Message	Origami	Why?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I notice that I've never seen you smile
nor seen you look like you're having fun."	
Message	Origami	I won't smile.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Origami	Until I avenge my parents.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	"So long as Spirits exist in this world, I will
not smile. I cannot smile."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Sorry...	
Message	Origami	It's fine. This is my business.	
Message	Shido	No, I was the one who was selfish for asking.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(So I guess it's true. Time stopped for Origami
five years ago. When her parents were slain
by the Spirits.)"	
Message	None	(She wouldn't force herself to smile...)	
Message	None	"(Still, I don't like seeing Origami undergo
so much pain, but I want to see her live a
normal life, filled with fun...)"	
Message	None	(I want Origami's smile back...)	
Message	Kotori	"The outlet tower seems to be the base for
the barrier. Nice of AST to come in handy
from time to time."	
Message	Shido	"At first nothing happened, so we tried going
home, but when Origami, um, t-touched the
outlet tower... the Guardian appeared."	
Message	Kotori	"You were pursuing Origami Tobiichi, huh? If you
take matters into your own hands, it defeats the
purpose of calling us."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, but if I waited, I wouldn't have caught up,
and we wouldn't have known about the outlet
tower, you know?"	
Message	Kotori	"Hmpf. Typical. Everything works out in the end,
huh?"	
Message	Shido	Oh!	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I guess the two of you were safe, so I'll
let it slide this time."	
Message	Kotori	"I'm having Reine analyze both cornerstones. If we
can discover the other locations, we can find the
center of the barrier, likely the enemy's base."	
Message	Shido	Their base, huh...	
Message	Kotori	"I'll analyze the data, so just continue the dates,
Shido. If anyone goes on a rampage and Tengu
City is destroyed, our work will go to waste."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	???	"...In this dream... no one can become happy...
Shido Itsuka... I hope your next dream will be
a happy one..."
