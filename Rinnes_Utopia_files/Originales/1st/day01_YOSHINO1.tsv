Message	Shido	I wonder how Yoshino's doing.	
Message	None	"Yoshino is alone more often than not.
Even if Yoshinon is with her, I need to look after her."	
Message	Reine	What is it, Shin?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Reine-san. Where are you right now?	
Message	Reine	Oh. I'm in your room, actually, but...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Reine	"Well, I've been imposing. I thought I'd show
my appreciation by cleaning a little."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you really don't need to clean, it's okay...	
Message	Reine	Don't even worry about it. Oh, and Shin?	
Message	Shido	Yes?	
Message	Reine	"That thing you were hiding...
I'll pretend I never saw it, okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! What thing?!
Come on, you can't just say that!"	
Message	Reine	Hm? Oh, right. My apologies...	
Message	Shido	"You don't need to apologize, but please...
just give me a break."	
Message	Reine	"By the way Shin, didn't you contact me
for something important?"	
Message	Shido	Oh... right.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, so if you're at my house...
then Yoshino's nearby, right?"	
Message	Shido	"I was wondering how Yoshino is doing.
Could you possibly take her to school and... huh?"	
Message	None	"(Saying it made me realize, but Reine-san...
she's a teacher at my school. Why is she
already at my house?)"	
Message	Reine	Ah. Well, it's a piece of cake with the Fraxinus.	
Message	Shido	Can you please stop reading peoples' minds?!	
Message	Reine	"Well... okay, I understand.
But why the school of all places?
You could come home first then leave somewhere."	
Message	Shido	"I thought maybe Yoshino would be
happy if we met outside somewhere... you know?"	
Message	Reine	"I see. I could see it as you trying to make
things easier for yourself, but..."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? No, no, no! It's not that at all!
So, where's Yoshino?"	
Message	Reine	Ah, I believe she's somewhere in the house.	
Message	Shido	Oh, so she's not right there with you.	
Message	Reine	No, but she was helping me clean until a moment ago.	
Message	Reine	"But when she spotted... the item...
she scurried off like a scared little mouse..."	
Message	Shido	"What?! That's...
What have you done?!"	
Message	Reine	"Anyway, I'll bring her over right away.
But, it'll be a different story if Yoshino
says she doesn't even want to see your face."	
Message	Shido	"Ha... yeah...
Wait, this isn't something to laugh about!"	
Message	Reine	In any case, please wait there.	
Message	None	(They're late. Could it be... they're not coming?)	
Message	None	"(Reine-san did say she saw that item under the bed.
Even if she's a spirit who's not well versed with
society, it'd be a shock to any girl.)"	
Message	None	"I wonder if Yoshino's started to hate me.
She wouldn't be coming anymore today if...
And if... that were to happen, I..."	
Message	Yoshino	Hey, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, sorry for calling you
out here like this."	
Message	Yoshino	N-No, it's no trouble... I'm glad.	
Message	Reine	Oh, good. You two were able to find each other.	
Message	Shido	Reine-san... I thought you were going to be here, too.	
Message	Reine	"It'd be a little nonsensical for a guardian
to come along on a date, wouldn't it?"	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess so...	
Message	Reine	"Okay, so before your date gets started, I think
you'll need to clear the air in regards to...
well, you know what."	
Message	Shido	"Right. Reine-san, how much did Yoshino
actually see?"	
Message	Reine	"Hm. Well, she ran away as soon as I started
flipping through it, so I can't imagine
she saw it very thoroughly."	
Message	Shido	"D-Do you think, I could just pretend that
it didn't happen?"	
Message	Reine	"Who knows, I believe that's up to Yoshino.
Listen, make sure you're careful not to worsen
a spirit's mood."	
Message	Shido	Come on... at least give me some advice.	
Message	Reine	"The Fraxinus' AI is acting up... it won't
display any choices. So it seems... all
I can do is watch over you two."	
Message	Shido	Isn't that just peeping at this point then?!	
Message	Reine	Alright then, I'll leave Yoshino to you.	
Message	Shido	W-What should I do?	
Choice		I should just come clean and tell the truth.	
Choice		I'm a guy... it's normal. I'll just pretend I didn't know. 	
Message	Shido	U-Um... I'm glad that you came, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Er, well... you saw it, right? In my room...	
Message	Yoshino	"Huh?! U-Um... I-I'm sorry!
I didn't mean... to see it, but..."	
Message	Shido	"No, no, no... don't apologize, Yoshino!
In fact, I should be the one apologizing!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoohoo! It's quite manly of you to apologize!
But having this part of your manliness
exposed is quite the blunder of a lifetime!"	
Message	Shido	"O-Oogh...
Yoshinon... you..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, Shido-kun... you are a guy.
I guess it's par for the course."	
Message	Shido	I-Is that so?	
Message	Yoshinon	That's right. Yoshino's not angry or anything like that～.	
Message	Shido	Huh, really?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yup, yup. Yoshino is a kind girl who could fill
an ocean with the love in her heart. She'll
never be mad at a guy for something like this."	
Message	Shido	Thank goodness.	
Message	Shido	Okay then... let's get going, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	Um... ahem...	
Message	Shido	What is it, Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun, don't you have something to say?	
Message	Shido	"Ah, u-ummmm...
What are you talking about?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, trying to pretend it away huh?!
Bad idea considering we definitely saw it!"	
Message	Shido	Ah, no... that's, um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, you're a guy so there isn't much
we can do about that... but it's just tasteless
to pretend like we didn't see it."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, okay, okay! I get it!
Yoshino, I'm sorry."	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... I-I'm so sorry too!
 I didn't mean... to see it, but..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino's an understanding young lady.
All you had to do was apologize, Shido-kun,
and she'd definitely return the favor."	
Message	Shido	Thank goodness.	
Message	Shido	"You took a little longer to get here today,
right? I thought you might've been upset..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's silly. She simply got a little caught up
getting ready to come see you. Right, Yoshino?"	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Yoshinon	Come on, Shido-kun, didn't you notice?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino's dressed to the nines today.
She's going on a date with you, after all!"	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	None	"(N-Now that he mentions it, today Yoshino's hair is slightly
more silken and fluffy. I think it smells nice too...)"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I actually... wanted to get ready faster, but...	
Message	Yoshinon	I helped too! It took forever...	
Message	Shido	"Do you think it took longer because one
of your hands has to hold Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Shido-kun, are you calling me the bad guy?	
Message	Yoshino	You did nothing wrong, Yoshinon!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no, nothing like that... I'm sorry.
Forget I said anything. Alright, let's
get going..."	
Message	Shido	Okay, where to go for our date?	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, are there any places you'd like
to go in particular?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Um... um...	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Yoshino	Ummm......	
Message	Shido	"Don't stress yourself out thinking about it.
Why don't we go to the shopping district?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... y-yes!	
Message	Shido	"Okay, here we are: the shopping district.
Now what should we do?"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino wants to go look at that store.	
Message	Shido	"That store? Really? But that's an electronics store...
Do you want to look at the appliances or something?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-yes, I would... um... is that not alright with you?	
Message	Shido	Oh, no, it's perfectly fine. Let's go check it out.	
Message	Yoshino	Okay!	
Message	Yoshino	Wow...	
Message	Shido	"This floor sells cooking appliances and stuff like
that. Doesn't seem too exciting, huh?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san... you use these appliances
to make food, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Yes. The ones they're selling are just like
the ones that I use at home."	
Message	Yoshino	It's... amazing.	
Message	Shido	Ah, really? I mean, it's kind of ordinary to me...	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshino	Um... what is... this?	
Message	Shido	"This is a rice cooker. You can steam rice with it.
It's a nicer one than what we have at home,
so it probably cooks much more delicious rice."	
Message	Yoshino	Even... more delicious?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... but it's not an easy thing to buy...	
Message	Yoshino	I... I see...	
Message	Yoshino	"W-What about this?
What is... this over here?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's a wok. It'd feel really authentic if you made fried
rice with it. Well, it's too big for our stove back home, but..."	
Message	Yoshino	"I... see. T-Then...
What about this?"	
Message	None	"(There are so many things she doesn't get a chance
to see up close. She must be having a blast with this.
I'm just glad she seems to be enjoying herself."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, Yoshino, you're getting so carried away!
Watch your step, okay? Don't break anything!"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, right... I-I'm sorry.	
Message	Shido	"No, no, you're doing fine.
I'm just glad you're having fun."	
Message	Yoshino	T-Thank you!	
Message	Shido	I know, why don't you buy something, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?	
Message	Shido	You're curious, aren't you?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um...	
Message	Clerk	Hi, do you need help with something?	
Message	Yoshino	Ah?!	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... well, um...	
Message	Yoshinon	Gooo, Yoshino! You're fine! Yoshinon is with you!	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Yoshinon	You can do it, Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	Right...	
Message	Yoshinon	Hit 'em where it hurts!	
Message	Yoshino	I'll... I'll beat them up!	
Message	None	(That's probably not the best idea...)	
Message	Yoshino	...U-Umm.	
Message	Clerk	Yes? How can I help you?	
Message	Yoshino	?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!	
Message	Yoshinon	Well, she, uh... tried.	
Message	Clerk	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Shido	Nothing's the matter! Sorry to trouble you.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, are you okay?
Let's go outside and get some fresh air."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	Feel better?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... I'm sorry.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't even sweat it, Yoshino."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you tried your best.
There's nothing to apologize about."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	What were you trying to say to the clerk?	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... um...	
Message	Yoshino	"Well, I wanted to know... what kind of appliances
I need... to make more delicious meals..."	
Message	Shido	Why?	
Message	Yoshino	So that... everyone can smile... and be happy!	
Message	Shido	Oh, really?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	I can't help but feel a little embarrassed...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshinon loves Shido-kun's cooking, too!	
Message	Shido	Thanks. Wait... Yoshinon, you can't eat... right?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hm... or can I...?"	
Message	Yoshino	A-Anyway, it was just... I couldn't do it!	
Message	Shido	"Ah, it's okay. You don't need to beat
yourself up for that, you know."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yoshino... if there was any dish in the world
you could eat, what would it be?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Just think... what kind of flavors do you like?	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshinon wants something fluffy and sweet!"	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... I-I'd like that, too...	
Message	Shido	"I see. Maybe sweet potato then?
How about... daigaku imo?"	
Message	Yoshino	Daigaku... imo?	
Message	Shido	Yeah! It's sweet and fluffy.	
Message	Yoshinon	"I knew you'd think of the perfect dish!"	
Message	Shido	"If I recall, using an anhydrous pot
makes it better. Then, since we're
here, I'll buy one."	
Message	Yoshino	A-Anhydrous pot? W-What is that?	
Message	Shido	It's an appliance that makes food more delicious.	
Message	Yoshino	Ah!	
Message	Shido	"You may not have been able to talk
to the clerk, but I think we're on the
same page about food, Yoshino."	
Message	Shido	"I'm gonna make some daigaku imo
for both you and Yoshinon!"	
Message	Yoshino	T-Thank you, so much!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Good job, Yoshino!"	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	Here we go...	
Message	Yoshino	It's not heavy, is it?	
Message	Shido	It's... no, this is fine... whoa!	
Message	Yoshino	I can help too!	
Message	Shido	No, it's okay...	
Message	Yoshino	Well, just tell me if you need help!	
Message	Shido	Sure thing. Thanks.	
Message	Yoshino	Of course!	
Message	Shido	You seem really happy...	
Message	Yoshino	Hm? I do?	
Message	Shido	Yes.	
Message	Yoshinon	"You're just excited to eat daigaku imo, right?!"	
Message	Shido	That's just the motivation I need to make them.	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... it's true.	
Message	Shido	You're really looking forward to it, huh? I'm glad.	
Message	Yoshino	Ah!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshino... are you busy tonight?	
Message	Yoshino	Tonight?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, we're all going to the lake tonight.
We're giving an offering to the Tengu Cow."	
Message	Yoshino	Tengu Cow?	
Message	Shido	"The guardian deity of Tengu City, apparently.
Offerings have been lacking lately and we all
said we'd go. It'll definitely test our courage..."	
Message	Shido	Do you want to come with us?	
Message	Yoshino	Will it be... scary?	
Message	Shido	"Uh... well, it is at night... and in a deserted place.
It might be a little scary. You don't have to
come, so don't feel like you have to, if..."	
Message	Yoshino	I'll come!	
Message	Shido	Huh?! Really?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes! It might be a little scary, but if
everyone is going too then I'll be okay."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Woohoo! That's the stuff, Yoshino!"	
Message	Shido	Great!	
Message	Yoshinon	"This'll be the perfect midnight rendezvous!\nYou might get lucky, Yoshino... do your best!"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshinon, that sounds a little suggestive...
okay, Yoshino, I'll see you tonight."	
Message	Yoshino	Okay! I'll do my best out there.
