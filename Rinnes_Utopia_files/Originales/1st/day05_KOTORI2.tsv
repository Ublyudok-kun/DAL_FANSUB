Message	Shido	Kotori... seems so busy today.	
Message	Shido	"I wanted to ask her out on a date today, but
if she's all booked up, maybe I should refrain."	
Message	Shido	"I can check up on her in the meantime. I wonder
if Kotori is visiting Reine-san right now."	
Message	Shido	If I can't find her, then I'll give up.	
Message	Shido	Kotori always seems so busy...	
Message	Shido	"I wanted to ask her out on a date today, but
if she's all booked up, maybe I should refrain."	
Message	Shido	"I can check up on her in the meantime. If she
doesn't pick up, I'll leave it for now."	
Message	Shido	"Is Kotori here? I don't hear anyone talking.
Anyone there?"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, there's Kotori. Looks like she's deep in
thought or something. Maybe I shouldn't bother
her."	
Message	Kotori	Hm...? Oh, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yo...	
Message	Kotori	"What is it? Did you have more business with
Reine?"	
Message	Shido	No. This time it was with you, but...	
Message	Kotori	But what?	
Message	Shido	"You seemed so busy. You don't have time
for a date, do you?"	
Message	Kotori	R-Right. Sorry, it's just...	
Message	Shido	Oh. Don't worry about it.	
Message	Shido	I'll invite someone else today then.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Later...	
Message	Kotori	...Wait.	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Kotori	I'm going on a date with you.	
Message	Shido	Huh? B-but I thought you were busy...	
Message	Kotori	I told you I'm going!	
Message	Kotori	I felt stuck anyways... I need a little break.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Then let's go.	
Message	Kotori	Okay, let's.	
Message	Shido	"All right. Now that we're in town, where should
we go? Wanna grab a bite?"	
Message	Kotori	...Yeah.	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Oh... huh? O-Oh yeah... Sorry, what is it?	
Message	Shido	I was asking if you wanted to grab a bite.	
Message	Kotori	Right. I'll eat whatever you want to eat.	
Message	Shido	Aren't you craving anything?	
Message	Kotori	Nothing in particular.	
Message	Shido	Then, how about that...?	
Message	Kotori	That? You mean the taiyaki stall?	
Message	Shido	I'll buy some, so wait right here.	
Message	Kotori	Sure.	
Message	Shido	Sorry for the wait... H-Hey, Kotori?!	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?! Do you feel sick?	
Message	Kotori	Don't shout. It'll give me a headache.	
Message	Shido	Oh. S-Sorry, b-but...	
Message	Kotori	"Honestly, I feel sick. I want to lay down,
but..."	
Message	Kotori	Sorry. Let me be for just a little longer.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	I'm fine. I'm fine...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	"(Kotori... looks like a ghost. Is it a good idea
for me to let her be...?)"	
Message	None	"(If she says she's fine, then that's all that
matters. But, what if she's not...?)"	
Message	None	(I...)	
Choice		Ask her to take a rest.	
Choice		Lend a hand.	
Message	Shido	Kotori, take it easy.	
Message	Kotori	"O-Okay. Sorry. We're on a date and this is
what happens."	
Message	Shido	Don't worry about that. Your health comes first.	
Message	Kotori	Th-Thanks...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...How do you feel? A bit better?	
Message	Kotori	Y-Yeah, kinda...	
Message	Shido	Cool. We should head home to let you rest.	
Message	Kotori	...Right.	
Message	Shido	Can you walk?	
Message	Kotori	Somehow...	
Message	Shido	Then let's go home.	
Message	Kotori	Okay... Sorry.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Kotori	Nothing. Don't worry about it.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(I wonder if Kotori really is okay...)	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	"(Maybe Kotori's right. She'll feel better in
no time, but... what if she doesn't?)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Huh...? A-Aah!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What are you doing?! Let me down.	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I can't do that.	
Message	Kotori	WHAT?! Wh-what did you just say?	
Message	Shido	You barely ever let it slip when you're sick.	
Message	Shido	I can't just let you live this way...	
Message	Kotori	B-But I'm embarrassed...	
Message	Shido	"Who cares about that? Health comes first.
If you're actually embarrassed, just bury
your face in my back so no one sees you."	
Message	Shido	"If I can't help you at a time like this, what's
the point in me being your big brother?"	
Message	Kotori	...Shido.	
Message	Kotori	...You're so dumb.	
Message	Shido	I know.	
Message	Kotori	How much of a sister complex do you have?	
Message	Shido	You got a problem with that?	
Message	Kotori	No, but...	
Message	Shido	Then, be still.	
Message	Kotori	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kotori? If you're sick, you don't have to
answer, but..."	
Message	Shido	"Do you remember doing this when we
were little?"	
Message	Shido	"Remember when you fell in the park and
cut your knee?"	
Message	Shido	"Back then, I panicked because I let you
get hurt."	
Message	Shido	"I need to get her to a doctor immediately!\nWhat if she needs surgery?!"\n...I remember saying that.	
Message	Shido	"It was a just a scratch though, obviously...
Haha. Didn't stop me from panicking."	
Message	Kotori	Which means you haven't changed a bit since.	
Message	Shido	"On the contrary, you've sure grown up.
But I hoped that I'd be grown by now too,
you know?"	
Message	Kotori	You're fine just the way you are, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Oh, yeah? I sure hope that's true.	
Message	Kotori	It is... I don't want you to change.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	"Besides, I haven't changed as much as you
suggest."	
Message	Shido	"No, you've totally changed. Your mouth is
bigger, and you're meaner."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	"(Oops. I should say something good about
her.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, but uh... In a sense, you've gotten cuter
at least..."	
Message	Kotori	What?! Wh-What did you just say?	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing!	
Message	Kotori	S-Say it again!	
Message	Shido	I refuse!	
Message	Kotori	Jeez, you're such a coward.	
Message	Shido	Shut up!	
Message	Kotori	"Um, I guess you're right, but I still don't think
I've changed much."	
Message	Kotori	Because... from that moment, I've...	
Message	Shido	...Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	We're home, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	You can let me down now.	
Message	Shido	Really?	
Message	Kotori	...Yeah.	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways Shido, I told you I didn't want to, but
you forced me to piggyback you in public."	
Message	Shido	W-Well, I was just desperate to help.	
Message	Kotori	...I know that.	
Message	Kotori	"Um. Thanks, Shido. I felt safe with you carrying
me. Now, I feel so much better."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	And... you have changed, though you can't tell.	
Message	Kotori	"I never realized how much bigger your back
is. Hadn't noticed at all."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, yeah. Well, my body's gone through some
changes since we were kids."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...Want to go inside?	
Message	Kotori	Okay.
