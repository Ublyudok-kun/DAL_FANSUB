Message	Shido	...Zzzz...	
Message	Kotori	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	...Mm...mrgh...	
Message	Kotori	Shido, wake up.	
Message	Shido	"...Urh... Huh...? Kotori?
What's wrong? It's so early..."	
Message	Kotori	"I have a report. I'll just take some of your time
before breakfast."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Gotcha. Wait just a sec.	
Message	Shido	"So, what's the report? Is it about the monument,
or about what attacked us?"	
Message	Kotori	Both.	
Message	Shido	Both?	
Message	Kotori	"When you approached that monument, an
angel-like being appeared as if to interfere.
There's no mistaking that, right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Kotori	Then, it makes sense to think of them as a set.	
Message	Shido	"I guess that's true... So, who was that person?
Was it a Spirit?"	
Message	Kotori	"There's not enough information to know for sure.
From observing the numbers we have on it, it's
true that it resembles a Spirit."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"From a data perspective, it's an entity extremely
similar to a Spirit. Given its movement, it must
be different from the others, who have free will."	
Message	Shido	...Erm?	
Message	Kotori	"...Even if your brain is smaller than a
Megaphragma mymaripenne's, it'd be good for you
to attempt at least a little imagination."	
Message	Shido	Oof... What the heck kind of creature is that...?	
Message	Kotori	"Anyway, it's definitely an existence generated
by a Spirit. Considering the situation you
described..."	
Message	Kotori	"If you were to put it into game terms, it would be
a "Golem" or a "Guardian"... That sort of thing."	
Message	Shido	That sounds kinda surreal.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you might want to think about your own
situation before saying something like that."	
Message	Shido	Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"If we are to believe your story, then most
likely... That "Guardian" is a type of defense."	
Message	Shido	D-Defense?	
Message	Kotori	"In other words, there exists a necessity to
protect the monument to some extent."	
Message	Shido	I see now... But we don't know the details, right?	
Message	Kotori	"Right, we don't know exactly. But at the very
least, it's definitely related to the barrier
in some way."	
Message	Kotori	"We narrowed our observations to the time of day
from your report, and analyzed the spiritual
wave patterns around the monument."	
Message	Shido	So, did you find anything?	
Message	Kotori	"The weak spiritual wave pattern coming from the
monument... is the same as the barrier surrounding
Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	"The scale was so different, I almost overlooked
it. When the idea suddenly came to me and I tried
it, it was a perfect fit."	
Message	Shido	Then... That means...	
Message	Kotori	"The barrier and the monument are closely
related. In conclusion, this "Guardian" must
be coming from the same place as well."	
Message	Kotori	"And what this points to is that the monument is
definitely the foothold supporting the barrier."	
Message	Shido	"The foothold you were talking about before is the
monument?! Then, if we destroy it..."	
Message	Kotori	"If it were that easy we'd already have done it.
Unfortunately, it's not that simple of a story."	
Message	Shido	Could it be... It's not the only one?	
Message	Kotori	"...Nice observation. Exactly. There has to be
something else in Tengu City that gives off
the same protection signature."	
Message	Shido	"So now we have to find the other one...
That means this is just the beginning."	
Message	Kotori	"Right, we've got a long road ahead of us.
But Shido, that's our job to investigate.
You should prioritize your dates."	
Message	Shido	B-But, at this rate―	
Message	Kotori	"Of course, if you find anything, report it to me.
But you can't do anything else... Got it?"	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Kotori	"If our analysis helps us determine where the
enemy's stronghold is, that'd be great, but..."	
Message	Shido	Enemy...? Do you mean the "Guardian"?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm talking about whoever made the barrier.
The one who's got us locked in. But enough talk!
Just focus on what you need to do!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... Sorry. I'll cooperate as much as I
can. I'm sure it's tough for all of us."	
Message	Kotori	"In case it needs to be said, I'll say it: You're
not invincible, so don't overdo it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I promise.	
Message	Kotori	"Seriously... At this rate, I'm going to be even
more exhausted from worry than Reine..."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	I-It's nothing!	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...
