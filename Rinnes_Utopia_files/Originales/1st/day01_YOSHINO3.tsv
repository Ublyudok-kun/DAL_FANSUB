Message	Shido	Hey! Tonomachi!	
Message	Shido	Where are you, Tonomachi??	
Message	Shido	Are you okay? Say something if you can hear me!	
Message	Shido	"It's no use, I don't see him anywhere.
Seriously, where did he go?"	
Message	Shido	"Could it be, he was really spirited away?
No, like that'd happen. Besides, the Tengu Cow
is a lie that Tonomachi came up with..."	
Message	Shido	"T-There's no such thing as ghosts, anyway.
E-Even if there were, I'm not scared in the――"	
Message	???	I found youuuu!	
Message	Shido	Hyeeeeeeeek!	
Message	Shido	"W-Who's there?!
Wait, what?"	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yoshino?
Was that voice just now, Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Man, I didn't think you'd freak out\nlike that. Sorry, Shido-kun. I got\nsurprised by your surprise."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	N-No, no, I'm not scared! I'm totally not scared!	
Message	Shido	"M-More importantly, what's wrong?
I told you to stay with everyone else."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I want to be... with Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	With me? What?	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I feel... more reassured with you.
Is that wrong?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No...it's fine, but...
Then, should we go together?"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Shido	Alright... then, be careful not to get separated.	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tonomachiiii!	
Message	Shido	Tonomachiii, where are youuuu?!	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	Yoshino? Are you okay?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Shido	You don't look okay...	
Message	Yoshino	I'm sorry!	
Message	Yoshino	Ah!	
Message	Shido	"It's starting to get cold... as expected of a courage test...
Yoshino, be careful not to catch a cold...huh?!"	
Message	Shido	W-Wait, this cold air... it's from you, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry... I-I was scared, so...	
Message	None	"(Is this bad? Yoshino might be
on the edge of losing it.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Ah!!	
Message	None	(Alright!)	
Message	Shido	Here.	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Um...	
Message	Shido	"Let's, hold hands...
You know... we might get separated, after all.
It might calm you down, too."	
Message	Yoshino	I-Is that true?	
Message	Shido	"I mean, you asking me like that makes me
feel like it might not help but... probably."	
Message	Yoshino	Okay, sure...	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshino	!	
Message	Shido	How do you feel?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san... your hand is so warm...	
Message	Yoshino	I feel more calm now...	
Message	Shido	That's good to hear, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Yoshinon	"I'm feelin' like a third wheel right about now!"	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"A guy and a girl... walking alone in the\nnight... isn't this you know... a thing?!\nWhat are you about to do?!"	
Message	Shido	W-What are you talking about?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"You two were about to go find somewhere\nquiet right now, huh, Shido-kun?!\nI mean, it's okay, I'm not mad or anything!"	
Message	Shido	S-Stop making fun of me! Let's go, Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ah, what I would give to be young again!"	
Message	Kotori	"You're finally here!
Onii-chan... what took you so long?"	
Message	Shido	We got a bit lost out there. Sorry for the wait.	
Message	Kotori	"Lost?! How can the search party
be the one who gets lost?!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	None	(Wow, I completely forgot about Tonomachi, didn't I?)	
Message	Shido	Man, where in the world is Tonomachi?
