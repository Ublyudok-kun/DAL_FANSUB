Message	None	"(Rinne's been acting strange lately. Did something happen?
I can't say I'm not being a burden on her, either...)"	
Message	None	"(Ah, shoot... I'm suddenly at the park.
If I'm too lost in thought, my legs end up leading me
by themselves. At least the park isn't too crowded.)"	
Message	None	(Wait, huh? Is that, Rinne?)	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	Rinne, what's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	Ah. Shido?!	
Message	Shido	Didn't you... have some sudden business...?	
Message	Rinne	Ah, yeah. That's... fine now.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Shido	What are you doing alone in a place like this?	
Message	Rinne	"Y-Yeah... I was just thinking, I guess?
What about you, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Hmmm, well... I was sorta... also thinking?	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee. So you were thinking too, huh?
What were you thinking about?"	
Message	Shido	Um, well you see... Hey, I won't get caught up in that!	
Message	None	"(I can't really say, in front of the actual person...
That I was thinking of her, after all.)"	
Message	Rinne	What, there's something you can't tell even to your childhood friend?	
Message	Shido	"I-It's nothing like that, but... I-I was taking a walk while
thinking about what might be for dinner tonight."	
Message	Rinne	"Good grief, you're such a glutton, Shido.
That's really what you were thinking of?"	
Message	Shido	Is that so wrong?	
Message	Rinne	"It's fine. I just thought that you sound kinda like Tohka-chan.
I wonder if that happens when you spend enough time with
someone?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Ah, yeah. Now that you mention it...	
Message	Rinne	But that's what I like about you, Shido, you know?	
Message	Shido	Wh... What?! What'd you just say?!	
Message	Rinne	N-Nothing! I didn't say anything!	
Message	Shido	I-I see... So, what were you thinking of until now?	
Message	Rinne	"Ah, well, you know... I was also thinking about tonight's
dinner, I guess? Just thinking of what to make for you
later."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Guess we're not so different, huh?	
Message	Rinne	"Is that wrong? I put a lot of thought into each day, no?
You begin to tire of the same meals every day, not to
mention taking into account nutritional value and such."	
Message	Shido	Thanks. And sorry, for causing you trouble.	
Message	Rinne	It's fine, I do it because I want to.	
Message	Shido	"I see... Then Rinne, I don't know if it would really make
up for things, but would you want to go buy stuff for dinner
together now?"	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, I'm fine buying things on my own,
so why don't you take someone else out to
have fun?"	
Message	Shido	But I...	
Message	Rinne	It's fine, it's fine. I'm going to go shopping now.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	You better come back for dinner, okay? See you!	
Message	None	"(I'm not really in the mood to invite someone on a
date right now... Once I've rested a bit here, I'll just
head home for today...)"
