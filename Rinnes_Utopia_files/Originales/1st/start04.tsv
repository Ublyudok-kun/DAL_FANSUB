Message	None	"(Spirits... Supposedly they are beings that
shouldn't exist.)"	
Message	None	"(When a Spirit appears in the world, a spacequake
occurs involuntarily.)"	
Message	None	"(As the name implies, it's an earthquake in
space. A massive force bears down on the region,
explodes, leaving nothing but a smoking crater.)"	
Message	None	(It was first observed 30 years ago...)	
Message	None	"(Eurasia's center disappeared; over 150 million
were killed in the largest calamity in mankind's
history. Also known as the Eurasia Sky Disaster.)"	
Message	None	"(Just as they had sparked in the beginning,
small-scale spacequakes began to occur
throughout the world.)"	
Message	None	"(That's why the Spirits that cause them are
known as harbingers of disaster, earning the
ire and fear of the people around them.)"	
Message	None	"(The city in which we live, Tengu City, was once
the site of such an event. On that spot, a town
was built to test the latest technology.)"	
Message	None	"(I was living a normal, average
life when she arrived.)"	
Message	None	"(Spring break had ended, and my life as a
sophomore began on April 10th. On that day,
I met my first Spirit.)"	
Message	None	(I remember as if it were yesterday.)	
Message	None	"(The city was destroyed, and there was a huge
crater in the ground as if a meteor had struck.
In the center of it all, she stood.)"	
Message	None	"(I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She had taken
my heart in an instant. She was so beautiful,
almost otherworldly...)"	
Message	None	"(Her powers had the potential to destroy the
world, and because of that, she was reviled and
attacked by humans. She fought in her despair.)"	
Message	None	"(I just couldn't bring myself to think that she
was the world's enemy. Not only that, I wanted to
save her from her sadness.)"	
Message	None	(And my wish came true in the oddest way.)	
Message	None	"(A secret organization formed to protect the
Spirits. Kotori, Commander of Ratatoskr, told me
of my ability to seal the Spirit's powers.)"	
Message	None	"(If successful, then I would be able to save the
Spirits... However, the means to do so was
shocking to say the least...)"	
Message	None	"(It was to make the Spirits fall in love.
In other words...)"	
Message	None	"(I needed to spend as much time with them
as I could, and gain their affection.)"	
Message	None	"(With the help of Kotori and the members of
Ratatoskr, I began my interactions with the
Spirits...)"	
Message	None	"(I was able to save Tohka, Yoshino... and Kotori,
who regained her powers in order to protect me.)"	
Message	None	"(Origami's parents were murdered by a Spirit five
years ago. She didn't approve of my actions.
However, she has slowly grown to understand me.)"	
Message	None	"(There was one Spirit I couldn't save. A girl who
transferred to my school without hiding that she
was a Spirit. A girl with black hair... Kurumi.)"	
Message	None	"(As for her, there were a lot of instances that
made me doubt her. Neither Tohka nor Yoshino
bore any ill will toward anyone.)"	
Message	None	"(However, Kurumi was different. Kurumi killed
people of her own volition.)"	
Message	None	"(After hearing this from Tohka, I decided to save
Kurumi once more.)"	
Message	None	"(Kurumi was the other me... She claimed that if
she hadn't met me and instead stayed alone in her
suffering, she would have grown insane...)"	
Message	None	"(What Kurumi did was something
you can't just forgive.)"	
Message	None	"(But even if that were the case, I wanted to be
the one who could forgive her. I wanted to give
her the chance to start over.)"	
Message	None	"(But my wish didn't come true. Kurumi was defeated
by Kotori, and disappeared...)"	
Message	None	"(During that time, I met a girl claiming to be my
real little sister, Mana Takamiya. Injured during
the battle with Kurumi, she is in the hospital...)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka, Yoshino, Kurumi, Kotori, and Origami
(although she isn't a Spirit). Ever since I met
them, I...)"	
Message	None	(Hm? Who was that... Uh...?)	
Message	None	"(Hm?! I-I think she was...
That's right! That girl!)"	
Message	Shido	...Was I dreaming...?	
Message	None	"(I woke up, but I still couldn't distinguish
reality from the dream. A strange, flowy
sensation lingered...)"	
Message	None	(The girl I saw at the end...)	
Message	None	"(I thought back on the girl who seemed like family
but whom I couldn't recognize. I changed and
headed for the living room.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, you're late! When's breakfast?	
Message	Shido	Sorry, sorry... Wait, huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoo-hoo, Shido-kun. Did you sleep well?"	
Message	Yoshino	G-Good morning. Shido-san...!	
Message	Shido	G-Good morning... Why are you two here...?	
Message	Kotori	"What, did you forget already? I told you after
their checkup they'd come to live with us until
the Spirit Mansion was fixed."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh right, I guess you did say
something like that..."	
Message	Kotori	"Probably time for a brain scan at the hospital,
though I'm not sure if the machine can read
cobwebs."	
Message	Shido	"Ngh... H-Hey, don't blame me. My head still feels
fuzzy. I'm not at my best."	
Message	Kotori	"Maybe it's because you were doing something until
late last night with Origami Tobiichi."	
Message	Shido	I didn't do anything with her! You know that!	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. I guess I haven't ever considered that you
could do anything at all."	
Message	Shido	Oof...	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Shido... Did something happen between you and
Origami Tobiichi yesterday?"	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing happened. Don't worry, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Are you sure?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes, I'm sure!	
Message	Tohka	Okay, so long as you're okay!	
Message	Kotori	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Wh-What is it?!	
Message	Kotori	"I explained this yesterday, but the Spirits are
currently very unstable."	
Message	Kotori	"If they continue to go berserk without being able
to control themselves, God knows what kind of
casualties we could suffer."	
Message	Kotori	So be careful about what you say or do.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know.	
Message	Kotori	As long as you know.	
Message	None	(Kotori's right. I need to be careful.)	
Message	Shido	"All right, let's have some breakfast!
We'll be late."	
Message	Tohka	Yay! Breakfast!	
Message	Kotori	"It's been a while since I've had
your breakfast, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Hey Kotori, are you in a daze too? I always mak—	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh, that's right. Normally—	
Message	Tohka	Shido?! Is it ready yet?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, all right! I'm almost done.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, hurry!	
Message	Shido	Don't rush me. I'm almost done!	
Message	None	"(With the hungry Tohka now satisfied, we were able
to finish up breakfast. I headed toward the door,
excited to go to school.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay, Yoshino, can you stay home?	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuuun, be careful okay?! You just\nrecovered, so don't push yourself."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, I'll be careful.	
Message	Shido	Later!	
Message	Yoshino	H-Have a nice day...!	
Message	Tohka	Shido, you're slow!	
Message	Shido	Sorry!	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, what were you doing?	
Message	Shido	"I asked Yoshino and Yoshinon
to take care of the house."	
Message	Kotori	I see. Be sure to speed it up next time.	
Message	Shido	I'll be careful. Let's go—Hey, wait!	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	What's that...?	
Message	Shido	That big tower...	
Message	Kotori	What? Is the Neo Tengu Tower that weird?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? O-Oh, nothing... It's just...	
Message	None	"(Before me stood the usual houses and scenery I
was used to. But beyond that, in the center of
town, stood this abnormally shaped building.)"	
Message	None	"(It stood out so obviously from the buildings
around it, almost as if it were from another
world...)"	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, Shido. Are you serious? There are only so
many times I can joke about calling an ambulance
for you."	
Message	Kotori	"I can't believe you'd forget our town's new
symbol. The Neo Tengu Tower."	
Message	Shido	Neo Tengu Tower...? That thing?	
Message	Kotori	"It was just finished, and still a hot topic.
Supposedly, it's gonna open up in August."	
Message	Shido	R-Really...?	
Message	None	"(Did this thing really exist? I totally don't
remember... Rather, there's no way I wouldn't
notice a building like that.)"	
Message	???	Shido!	
Message	None	"(Someone called my name, and I turned around
to see a girl standing there.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh! U-Um...	
Message	Kotori	Shido? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	N-No... Sorry. Good morning, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	Huh...?!	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, Rinne-oneechan, what's gotten into you?	
Message	Rinne	"Oh... N-Nothing at all.
Good morning, Shido, Kotori-chan."	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Tohka	Rinne, good morning!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Good morning, Tohka-chan.	
Message	None	"(Did I just imagine that...? For a split second...
I felt like I forgot Rinne...)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne Sonogami. She's almost as close to me as
Kotori is.)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne lives next door, and we've been classmates
ever since we were little.)"	
Message	None	"(We've been together all that time, too.
Our parents got along, so it was natural
that she was always around.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know whether to feel pathetic or just
thankful, but until I met Origami or Tohka,
Rinne was my only female friend...)"	
Message	None	"(Because my parents were always out of town, Rinne would
drop by every morning to make breakfast for Kotori
and me. She even helps with cleaning and laundry.)"	
Message	None	"(In other words, she's like family. And a very
precious childhood friend.)"	
Message	None	"(To forget her... Man, I must still
be out of it...)"	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, Shido? You're spacing out again. If you're
feeling sick, you should rest more."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, maybe I'm not back at 100% yet.
But I'm fine now."	
Message	Rinne	"You'd better watch out, okay? If you get sick in
the summer, it can really drag on for a while."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, thanks!	
Message	Shido	Huh...? U-Um... Are you, um—	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido... Are you seriously okay?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	Rinne, good morning!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Good morning, Tohka-chan, Kotori-chan.	
Message	Kotori	Morning, Rinne-oneechan!	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne...?	
Message	Rinne	"Good morning, Shido... I was waiting for you for
quite a while."	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, good morning. If you take your time like
that, I'll get tired of waiting."	
Message	None	(...?!)	
Message	None	(Th-That's right... How could I forget...?)	
Message	None	"(Rinne Sonogami—She's almost as close
to me as Kotori.)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne lives next door, and we've been classmates
ever since we were little.)"	
Message	None	"(We've been together all that time, too.
Our parents got along, so it was natural
that she was always around.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know whether to feel pathetic or just
thankful, but until I met Origami or Tohka,
Rinne was my only female friend...)"	
Message	None	"(My parents always out of town, Rinne would
drop by every morning to make breakfast for Kotori
and me. She even helps with cleaning and laundry.)"	
Message	None	"(In other words, she's like family. And a very
precious childhood friend.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, if you're still feeling sick, maybe you
should still be resting?"	
Message	Shido	You know, maybe I'm not at my best yet.	
Message	Shido	...But I'm fine. Don't worry.	
Message	Rinne	"You'd better watch out, okay? If you get sick in
the summer, it can really drag on for a while."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, thanks...	
Message	Rinne	Oh...!	
Message	Shido	What's the matter, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"Hey, Shido? I think I noticed something
I shouldn't have..."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, well I feel like maybe it's not good.	
Message	Shido	Don't drag it out...	
Message	Rinne	"Um... Maybe we spoke too much.
We're going to be late."	
Message	Shido	"Huh? What?! Wh-Why didn't you say so, Rinne?!
Let's run!"	
Message	Rinne	Okay!	
Message	Shido	Come on! Tohka, Kotori, let's go!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido! Wait!	
Message	None	"(And that's how my life at school
started up again.)"	
Message	None	"(My days with Tohka, Yoshino, Kotori, Origami...
and Rinne.)"	
Message	None	(Today would be the start of another day.)
