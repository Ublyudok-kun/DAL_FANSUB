Message	Shido	Hey, Tonomachi!	
Message	Shido	"I walked all over, but he's still nowhere to
be found..."	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan! Let's deliver our offerings already!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay! Be right there...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh? I think I hear my name... At last, it's
my turn to shine!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Wooo! All of the mosquito bites were
worth it! Get over here already!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Of course... To make the most of the haunted
house, you gotta spook people. The looks on
those girls' faces... will be PRICELESS!"	
Message	Tonomachi	Hm? What's that?	
Message	Tonomachi	...?!	
Message	Tonomachi	AAAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	"Hm... What's that? Did I just hear...
HEY! Tonomachi!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you're late, Tonomachi! What the hell
were you doing?!"	
Message	Tonomachi	It's HEEEEEERE!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Where are you going?!	
Message	Tonomachi	It's here! It's here!	
Message	Shido	What's here?!	
Message	Tonomachi	I don't know! But I saw something!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. You're just trying to scare us,
but it's no use. We all know there's no such
thing as the Tengu Cow."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Wh-What are you talking about, Itsuka?!
That's bad juju!"	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about...?	
Message	Tonomachi	"I-I'm going home, okay?! You guys should
hurry on home as well!"	
Message	Kotori	*whimper, sniff*...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori! Are you okay?!	
Message	Yoshino	I-Is... something there?	
Message	Shido	"I don't know, but Tonomachi sure was
acting funny."	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"So, what's the plan now, Shido? Look\nhow adorable Yoshino gets when she's\nscared."	
Message	Shido	"Wha? Why're you asking me? Well,
guess we should just drop off our
offerings."	
Message	Kotori	Yes, great idea!	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, my stomach's beginning to growl. Anyway,
Origami Tobiichi, where are you off to?"	
Message	Origami	"None of your business. The one who pays
her offering first will be the one to have
Shido all to herself."	
Message	Tohka	What?! Grr. Victory will be mine!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Don't do anything reckless!	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido?!	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Did you say something just now?	
Message	Origami	A cry. It must be the Tengu Cow...	
Message	Kotori	Uuh... UUUUU!	
Message	Shido	"N-No! I didn't hear anything! No way! That
was nothing, right, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Uh... Yeah! I didn't hear anything...
I think?"	
Message	Rinne	"But if we don't head home now, then we might be in
real trouble. Let's drop these off already."	
Message	Shido	"Yes! Okay! Let's head for the shrine! We'll
leave our offerings, pay our respects, and—"	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Shido	Aah! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Tohka	Whoa! Is that the Tengu Cow! How menacing!	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	N-No! This isn't it! That's a crocodile!	
Message	Kotori	*whimper*...	
Message	Rinne	AAH! Are you okay, Kotori-chan? Kotori-chan?!	
Message	Yoshino	UEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, no! Something leapt out! Yoshino,\ntry to stay calm!"	
Message	Origami	Shido, I'm scared.	
Message	Shido	Now you're scared, too?!	
Message	Origami	Shido... I don't want us to separate.	
Message	Tohka	"Origami Tobiichi! What the hell do you
think you're doing?!"	
Message	Origami	"You should go on and defeat that thing.
In the meantime, I'm going to strengthen
my bond with Shido."	
Message	Tohka	Grr... I'm scared too, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Tohka! Not you, too!	
Message	None	"(Jeez... Talk about déjà vu. Wait, that's not
it!)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait, you guys! At this rate...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Wh-What's going on?! What's the matter?	
Message	Tohka	The Tengu Cow...?	
Message	Origami	...is gone.	
Message	Shido	What?! You gotta be kidding me!	
Message	None	(It couldn't just disappear... Huh?)	
Message	Shido	...Wait, was that—?!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido! Where are you going?!	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Tohka! Wait right there!	
Message	None	Can it be...? Could it be her...?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, my. You look pathetic, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?! How?!	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm sorry for bothering you while you're having
fun, but I'm going to take this one."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait! Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	"Sorry. I've got no time for you, Shido-san.
See you soon."	
Message	Kurumi	"Unfortunately, I don't have the time to deal
with you, Shido-san. Although I'd love to chat
more with you... I'm sorry."	
Message	Shido	"Hey! Damn it, Kurumi... What are you trying to
pull?"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! Now isn't the time to worry about this.
I gotta hurry back!"	
Message	Shido	Y-You guys! Everyone okay?!	
Message	Origami	Shido, are you safe?	
Message	Shido	I think so...	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Shido! Where has the Tengu Cow gone?!	
Message	Shido	"I told you, it was a crocodile. Hey, wait...
Right after that—"	
Message	Rinne	Sh-Shido! Come here! Kotori-chan is—!	
Message	Shido	What?! K-Kotori?!	
Message	Shido	Is she hurt?!	
Message	Rinne	I-I think she's just fainted...	
Message	None	(S-Sorry, Kotori...)	
Message	None	(We'll have the Fraxinus take her...)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey! Shido-kuuuuun!"	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Whaaaa? Sh-Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Are you all right, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino deserves some credit. She's been\nholding it in this whole time. One wrong step,\nand all of you would've drowned in the lake."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Good work, Yoshino! Quick thinking.	
Message	Yoshino	Wha...? Th-Thank you... so much...	
Message	Shido	"All right! Forget the offerings! Let's all head
home!"	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. I think it's better that we go home.
Everyone's exhausted."	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah. As soon as we get home, I need a bite
to eat."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Tohka-chan, you need to show some restraint\njust like Yoshino. Or else Shido-kun won't show\nyou any praise..."	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What?! Is that true, Shido? If I show more
restraint, would you praise me?"	
Message	Shido	Um, well, I think what she means is...	
Message	Origami	"Sounds like being a good girl loses you
some brownie points."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What do you mean?!	
Message	Shido	"You guys, how many times do we need to
go through this...?"	
Message	Rinne	"Now, now. It's fine. Watching them bicker
almost makes us forget how spooky things
are here."	
Message	Shido	You've got a point.	
Message	None	"(Yoshino went a little berserk and Kotori fell
unconscious, so after Rinne and I split, I
took everyone to the Fraxinus.)"	
Message	None	"(Everyone was immediately taken to the
infirmary, so I waited with Reine in the
control room.)"	
Message	Reine	...Shin, how much sugar do you want?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh... As much as you're using, Reine.	
Message	Reine	Hm, understood.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(I feel like she tends to be heavy-handed
with it, but I'll pretend not to notice.
Yeah...)"	
Message	Reine	"Going on dates with the Spirits is necessary,
but they can be unstable. Taking one on a date
could lead to emotional strain, understand?"	
Message	Shido	Yes...	
Message	Reine	"It's okay when nothing romantic is going on.
However, keep in mind that your actions can
lead to them going berserk."	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm sorry... So are Kotori and the rest of
the girls okay?"	
Message	Reine	"They're still getting treatment in the
infirmary. For now, I don't think there's
much to worry about."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Reine	"Kotori must have fainted on her own. She put a
limiter on to prevent from going berserk.
If she hadn't, things could have been grave."	
Message	Shido	What?! It's all my fault, then...	
Message	None	(I keep putting Kotori through too much stress.)	
Message	Reine	"Shin, if you hang your head too low, then you'll
disturb the Spirits. Accept your mistakes, and
be sure not to make them again."	
Message	Shido	R-Right! Point taken...	
Message	Shido	Hey, hang on! You're putting in too much!	
Message	Reine	"Hm... You think? I usually
put in more than this."	
Message	Shido	I can't drink something that sweet!	
Message	Reine	Hm, I see... *sluuurp*.	
Message	Reine	Hm... Could still use more.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Reine	"Well, I suppose I could add more later.
Shin, I still haven't been able to analyze the
phenomenon occurring in Tengu City."	
Message	Reine	"The Fraxinus is still in repair, and things are
not happening quite the way we had wanted.
It's a frustrating time for us as well."	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	Reine	"However, the Spirits seem to be reacting to
something like a barrier in Tengu City. There
is a greater output of energy than normal."	
Message	Shido	What's going on in Tengu City...?	
Message	Kotori	"We are looking into it. Haven't I told you that
it's something that doesn't concern you?"	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori?! Are you feeling better?!	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. How could I sleep at a time like this?	
Message	Kotori	"I took time out of my busy schedule to join you,
so why are you going around destabilizing the
Spirits, you idiot?! Do you have a death wish?!"	
Message	Shido	Argh! I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Kotori	Well, it's my fault for going, but still...	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, no. I was the one who forced you to
come—"	
Message	Kotori	"Anyway, Shido, focus on stabilizing the
Spirits and use your head next time."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... I'll try my best.	
Message	Kotori	Okay. Reine, we're heading home now.	
Message	Reine	"Mm... Is that so? I suppose it is rather late.
I'll drop you off then."	
Message	None	(Ahh... I'm pooped.)	
Message	None	"(So much has happened. If I dwell on it,
though, I'd probably lose sleep. I'm just
gonna hit the sack.)"	
Message	None	"(But the barrier in Tengu City... What could
it all mean?)"	
Message	None	"(It's pointless to think about it for now...
I just have to focus on keeping Tohka and
the other girls stable.)"	
Message	None	"(Even that is proving to be a challenge...
*yawn*)"	
Message	None	(Ahh...)	
Message	None	"(Tomorrow is the big Sports Day, huh? I wonder
why we're doing it before testing starts. This
schedule is brutal on a guy like me.)"	
Message	Shido	Anyways, good night...	
Message	None	"(Hm? Did I hear something just now?
Whatever. I'm going to bed...)"
