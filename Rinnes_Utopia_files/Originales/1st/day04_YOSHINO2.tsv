Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...?	
Message	Shido	"What are you doing in a place like this?
You're not gonna go inside?"	
Message	Yoshino	I was... looking at the sky...	
Message	Shido	The sky...?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... it's... very pretty...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, it's already evening. The sunset's peeking
through the clouds... It is pretty."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes.	
Message	None	"(Huh... For Yoshino to look pensively at the
sunset like this... She's quite the romantic.)"	
Message	None	"(I feel like it's been ages since I've looked
quietly at the sunset...)"	
Message	Reine	"Shin, can you hear me?"	
Message	Shido	"Reine-san?
Yes, I can hear you clearly."	
Message	Reine	"Are you with Yoshino at the moment?"	
Message	Shido	Yes, I am... What's wrong?	
Message	Reine	"I apologize as it's the usual. I had lost track\nof Yoshino's position..."	
Message	Reine	"Her mental status appeared stable, so I thought\nshe must be near you."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I am with her, but I just met up with her
a second ago."	
Message	Reine	"Hmm... That's intriguing. Seeing such\nrelaxed numbers without anyone with her...\nWhat was Yoshino doing?"	
Message	Shido	She was looking at the sunset, apparently...	
Message	Reine	"The sunset?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. She was saying the sky was pretty...	
Message	Reine	"I see. How interesting..."	
Message	Reine	"Shin, if you could, would you stay near Yoshino\nand observe her?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? I didn't want it to get too late, so I was
planning on taking her back home..."	
Message	Reine	"I'm curious about something. I believe it would\nyield interesting results about the movement of\na Spirit's psychological state... Or so I feel."	
Message	Shido	Oh then, I guess I should...	
Choice		Watch the sunset.	
Choice		Take her home.	
Message	Shido	"I understand. I'll treat the two of us to a sunset
date a little while longer."	
Message	Reine	"I'm counting on you, Shin."	
Message	Yoshino	Is something... wrong...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, no... I thought I'd watch with you, too...	
Message	Yoshino	Really...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... I'll try not to get in your way.	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-You're not... in the way, at all...
I'd be... happy, if you could... watch with me..."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... Then, since we're here...
Do you want to move to a place with a better view?"	
Message	Shido	There's a place where you can see more of the sky.	
Message	Yoshino	...?	
Message	None	"(Getting on top of the roof makes me feel like I'm
a child again. It's so nostalgic...)"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Shido	How pretty, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	...Huh?!	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, casual seduction is prohibited～!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I didn't mean it like that.
I was just saying the sunset is really pretty."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ohh, you were talking about the sunset. Too bad,\nhuh, Yoshino～?"	
Message	Yoshino	"No... I'm glad that Shido-san and I...
feel the same way!"	
Message	Shido	"If you hadn't told me, Yoshino, I would have
missed out on such an amazing view.
Thanks, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, we can't stay in a place like this
forever, we'd better head back home."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...? U-Umm...	
Message	Shido	"You can watch the sunset tomorrow, too.
You'll catch a cold if you stay out too late."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... a little... a little, longer, please...	
Message	Shido	D-Don't cry Yoshino! Just a little longer is fine.	
Message	Reine	"Shin, that was a mistake. Yoshino's psychological\nstatus is about to become unstable."	
Message	Shido	Wha... That wasn't what I meant to...	
Message	Yoshino	Can I watch... a little bit, longer?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... You can watch as long as you'd like.
But you have to come back home before it gets
dark, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Shido	Whew, I panicked a bit...	
Message	Reine	"Shin, you have to be a more careful.\nThe accumulation of even small missteps\ncan lead to them losing control."	
Message	Shido	Yes... I'll be careful from now on...
