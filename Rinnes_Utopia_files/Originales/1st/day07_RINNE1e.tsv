Message	Tamae	Hello. Good morning, everyone!	
Message	Tamae	Now, let's take attendance right away.	
Message	Tamae	Oh, oopsies. I have an announcement for everyone.	
Message	Tamae	"Heehee. Today, in fact, we have a transfer student
joining our class!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ohhh man! This didn't pop up on my information
network yet. Is it a guy or a girl? Either way,
this is one fiery development!"	
Message	Shido	Huh, a transfer student...? At a time like this?

Message	Rinne	"Nice to meet everyone. I'm Rinne Sonogami.
I hope to meet and get along with all of you."

a sort of ticklish voice, the kind yet sincere
eyes...)"	
Message	Tamae	"Your seat will be... Let me see. The seat next
to Itsuka-kun is open. Sonogami-san, over
there."	
Message	Rinne	Yes. I understand.	
Message	None	"(She turned my way, and met my gaze. I'm sure
nobody remembers her. No, there's no possible
way they could remember.)"	
Message	None	"(But... I remembered. If I have anything to say,
it's this. Straightforward, right at her.)"	
Message	Shido	...Welcome home, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. I'm home, Shido.
