Message	Shido	Heeeeey, Tonomachiiiiii!	
Message	Shido	Where are you, Tonomachiiii!	
Message	Shido	Are you okaaaay?! If you're here, say something!	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, I can't find him. Where'd that bastard
go?"	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Don't tell me he was actually...
Nah. Tonomachi made up the whole
"Tengu Cow" story himself."	
Message	Shido	"B-Besides, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Even if there was, I'm not scared of—"	
Message	???	Sh-Shido!	
Message	Shido	WHOA!	
Message	Shido	"K-Kotori...? Huh? Your ribbon, did you change
it?"	
Message	Kotori	Th-That doesn't matter right now!	
Message	Kotori	"Y-You said you'd protect me, but you left
me alone. Who the hell do you think you
are?!"	
Message	Kotori	"You went off on your own...
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!"	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, sorry. Instead of following me, wouldn't
it be less scary if you were with the others?"	
Message	Kotori	I-It... has to be you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...	
Message	Kotori	"Y-You promised! So you have to bear the
responsibility and stay close to me!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but...	
Message	None	"(Kotori seems incensed. She's never liked
scary stuff, but it won't be good if she gets
too stressed.)"	
Message	None	"(Was it a mistake for me to bring her
with me...? I have to focus on keeping
her calm.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay. I won't leave you alone anymore.	
Message	Kotori	R-Really...?	
Message	Shido	"Really. I'll be right beside you. So come on,
let's go."	
Message	Kotori	O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Um. If you pull too hard on my sleeve, it'll
stretch my shirt out."	
Message	Kotori	I'm not pulling!	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	I didn't pull!	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Kotori	AAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Kotori	Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...What was... that?	
Message	Shido	"Beats me. Maybe the wind whistled through
the grass."	
Message	Kotori	R-R-R-Really?	
Message	Shido	I think so. Uh...	
Message	Kotori	What is it?!	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, if you cling to me like that, I can't
keep walking..."	
Message	Kotori	I-I'm not clinging to you!	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	J-Just shut up! And stay still for a second.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What?	
Message	Shido	You... don't have act so tough, you know.	
Message	Kotori	...!	
Message	Shido	"When you were little, whenever you were
scared, you'd cling to me like this, wouldn't
you?"	
Message	Shido	"Whenever that happened, I'd pat your head
just like this, and you'd calm down after."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"You ascended as the commander of the
Ratatoskr. It seems like you've been working
so hard in the name of duty, but..."	
Message	Shido	"This, to me, feels like spending precious time
with my little sister. Nothing's changed."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Kotori	Sh-Shido...	
Message	Shido	"It's okay. I'm here. Everything's going to be
okay."	
Message	Kotori	Y-Yeah...	
Message	???	HEEEEY!	
Message	Kotori	...?!	
Message	Shido	Oh, is everyone here?	
Message	Tohka	"Hey, Shido! You were taking your time, so
we came over!"	
Message	Shido	"O-oh... S-sorry..."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Tohka	"Oh. Kotori has been with you, has she? I was
beginning to worry because we couldn't find
you."	
Message	Yoshino	I'm glad... we found you.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry. I got lost, and Kotori came looking
for me."	
Message	Tohka	"I see. Happy to see you've reunited. Now,
let's move on!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Seriously, though. Anyone see Tonomachi?
Damn it."
