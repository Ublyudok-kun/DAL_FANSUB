Message	Shido	Huh? Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"You're watching TV?
Huh, that's unusual."	
Message	Yoshino	"I thought I should... study this world properly...
So I borrowed... a video... from Kotori-san..."	
Message	Yoshino	"Huh, that's admirable, Yoshino. It's a good thing
to want to improve yourself. So, what show
are you watching?"	
Message	Video	"Goodness... you're ridiculous, big brother..."	
Message	Shido	Wha—?!	
Message	Video	"B-But... if you really want me to,\nbig brother, then..."	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! Wait, wait!!
Isn't this bad?!"	
Message	Yoshino	I-Is it...?	
Message	Shido	Ah, er... Well, you see...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hoo-whee～ It was just about to get good.\nYou won't stop us just before, right Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	"No, no, I'm stopping it.
Sorry, but wait just a moment!"	
Message	Kotori	"What's with all the yelling?"	
Message	Shido	"K-Kotori, you... This video isn't good at all for
young minds!"	
Message	Kotori	"It's easier to watch if it's anime, right? For\nfast and potent learning about love and romance,\nthere's no deeper teacher, wouldn't you say?"	
Message	Shido	"This is too deep! Don't you have
anything more normal?"	
Message	Kotori	"You're kidding, right? You like it,\ndon't you Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's not like I don't... No, that's not
important! Either way, I think it's way
too extreme a sample..."	
Message	Kotori	"But Yoshino has to live normally in this world,\nso don't you think she has a need to understand\nthese sorts of things as well?"	
Message	Shido	No, wait. That reasoning's all weird.	
Message	Kotori	"What? Well, it's not like I want to force it,\nso do whatever you want, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Rrrrgh... I-I...	
Choice		Allow her to watch.	
Choice		Take the video away.	
Message	Shido	"...It seems like she's curious about what happens
next, so this time I'll let it go."	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, if we see something not good, I'm
going to stop it, all right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Okay. I'll leave it... to you, Shido-san.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Goodness～! You like this too, huh Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	...All right, bring it on!	
Message	Video	"Big brother... Are you cold?\nIs it okay if I scooch closer...?"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Video	"Um... big brother?\nIs it okay... if we get in the bath together...?"	
Message	Yoshino	......!	
Message	Video	"Big brother... I'm scared all alone...\nIs it okay, if I get in bed with you...?"	
Message	Yoshino	......!	
Message	None	"(The dialogue from earlier made me imagine some
sort of forbidden love... but it was surprisingly
tame.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's over... Well, it was pretty interesting for
a romance movie."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Umm... Did Kotori-san... also,
do these sort of... um..."	
Message	Shido	"Ohh... Well, in the past I guess there were some
similarities... She would always cling to
me and stuff."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I see...	
Message	Shido	"Now, she's totally different, so it doesn't happen
anymore."	
Message	Yoshino	I... see...	
Message	Shido	Hmm... what's wrong?	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ahh, too bad, Shido-kun! It really was a little\nbit too strong of a shock for Yoshino, it seems!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Yoshino...	
Message	Shido	"N-No, it's not good!
This is too early for you, Yoshino!!"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aaaah, it was just about to get good!\nYou're such a meanie, Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	"N-No matter what you say, what's bad is bad! This
sort of show is like, you know... Something you
watch after you learn adult common sense and..."	
Message	Kotori	"...You all right there, Shido?\nAre you confusing yourself?"	
Message	Shido	Sh-Shut up...	
Message	Shido	"Either way... Yoshino, you don't have to rush
into becoming an adult. I'll be watching over
you, so..."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Yoshinon	"*Whistle* Not bad, Shido-kun. How manly!"	
Message	Shido	"For now, I'll return this video to Kotori.
Don't get fooled by bad senpais, all right...?"	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay.	
Message	Kotori	"Who's a bad senpai? Don't forget\nthis moment so easily."	
Message	Shido	Wait, Kotori?! Ah, now I've done it.
