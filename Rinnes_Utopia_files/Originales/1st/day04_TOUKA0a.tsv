Message	Tohka	Yawn... Yaaaaaawn...	
Message	Shido	Oh, Tohka. Morning. You seem pretty sleepy.	
Message	Tohka	...Mmh.	
Message	Shido	Were you up late studying or something?	
Message	Tohka	...Mhmm.	
Message	None	(Wha... That was supposed to be a joke, but...)	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. That must have been tough.
Breakfast's ready."	
Message	Tohka	"...Polite phrases...tolerance...calm...
*mutter* *mumble*..."	
Message	Shido	Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"...Well mannered...graceful...a soft demeanor...
*mumble* *mutter*..."	
Message	Shido	Heeeey.	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	Breakfast. Aren't you gonna eat? It'll get cold.	
Message	Tohka	I-I apologize...	
Message	Tohka	I-I'll eat now.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, help yourself.	
Message	None	"(For Tohka to ignore food and be engrossed
in studies... Is it going to snow tomorrow
or something?)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? I don't see Rinne anywhere.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Did I not tell you, Tohka?	
Message	Shido	"I decided today that I'll be taking care of
everything. I used to do it all before
anyway, so..."	
Message	Shido	"Besides, even though our test is so close, if I
take any more of Rinne's time, I'd feel bad
for her."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... I see... When someone who was usually there
no longer is, well... it is somewhat sad."	
Message	Shido	"Y-You're right... It is kinda sad. I got used to
the daily routine of being woken up by Rinne
and enjoying her delicious cooking..."	
Message	Shido	Now that she's not here... I guess I'm sad.	
Message	Tohka	Hm. I-I see...	
Message	Shido	"Hmm, what's wrong, Tohka? I'm not used to seeing
you eat so slowly."	
Message	Tohka	"Th-That is not true! Th-This is always how I am.
I am refined!"	
Message	None	(Huh? Refined...? Tohka...?)	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What? Is there something on my face?	
Message	Shido	No, nothing...	
Message	None	"(Hmmmm... Tohka's not herself.
It's kinda throwing me off...)"	
Message	Shido	...Hey, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"...Support men...depend on men...take a step
back...*mutter* *mumble*...*mumble* *mutter*..."	
Message	Shido	Heeeeey...	
Message	Tohka	"...Be honest...be good at listening...listen with
a smile...*mumble, mumble* *mutter*..."	
Message	None	"(I-It's no use... Looks like she's
not listening at all.)"	
Message	None	"(It sounded like she was memorizing vocabulary
during breakfast. She seems to be taking the
test seriously...)"	
Message	None	"(It'd be rude of me to bother Tohka when she's
challenging herself. Yeah, I'll leave her alone
for a while...)"	
Message	None	"(The weather's nice today. But even on a
refreshing morning like this, the reality is that
awful things are happening here in Tengu City...)"	
Message	None	"(Now that I remember, I wonder what that
""barrier's foothold"" was that Kotori
mentioned yesterday...)"	
Message	None	"(It's apparently something that's not
noticeable... but then how are we
supposed to look for it?)"	
Message	None	"(Even if I can't tell, maybe it's something that
Tohka and the other Spirits can sense?)"	
Message	None	Huh?! T-Tohka's not here!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka! Where are you?!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Sh-Shido?! Where are you?	
Message	Shido	"There you are! You know that's the path to Tengu
Tower, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... I was distracted, and it seems like I
wandered the wrong way. "	
Message	Shido	It's fine, as long as you're okay.	
Message	Tohka	I-I am sorry...	
Message	Shido	I know. Why don't we go down that path today?	
Message	Tohka	...?	
Message	Shido	"We still have time, and instead of heading back,
why don't we keep going? It might be nice
to do things like this once in a while."	
Message	Tohka	Hmmm...	
Message	Tohka	"A-At times like these... rely on men... take one
step back... so..."	
Message	Tohka	"Y-Yes! I agree. If you say so Shido, then I don't
mind. I'll let you guide us!"	
Message	Shido	"G-Guide? It's not that complicated a path, but...
oh well. All right. Let's go, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I-I will leave it to you!	
Message	None	"(Hm? I don't see anyone around. Maybe because
it's still early morning...)"	
Message	None	"(If I remember correctly, it's no longer going
to be used once the Neo Tengu Tower opens.
It's good we came; this will be our last look.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... Shido, what is that? There's a very large
rock over there!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's... that's... hmm...?!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What... is that?	
Message	None	"(Is that the monument Kotori was talking about?
B-But I have no memory of that being there...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, what? Do you not know either, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Er, y-yeah...!	
Message	None	"(This is strange...? I've gone down this path so
many times, but I don't remember it at all! It's
not like I'm still under the weather... am I...?)"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"I-If you wish to look at that rock, Shido...
I-I would not mind going to look at it together."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Er, yeah...	
Message	None	(This means Tohka wants to look at it, right?)	
Message	Shido	Um... Then, since we're here, let's take a look.	
Message	None	(Not to mention that it's bothering me anyway.)	
Message	Tohka	Ohh, I see! Then let's go! I will follow you!	
Message	Tohka	Heeeey! Shidoooo, hurry! Over here!	
Message	None	"(...She said she'd follow me, right? My eyes must
be playing tricks on me since she went ahead
herself...)"	
Message	None	―?! What the―?	
Message	Shido	Tohka! Behind you―!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Behind me...?	
Message	Shido	I-It disappeared?!	
Message	Shido	"A-Are you okay, Tohka?! Just now, the monument
shone, and―"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido... It's okay. If we don't go soon, won't we
be late for school?"	
Message	Shido	"Er, no, we'll still be fine, but...
What's wrong, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	"Nothing is the matter, is it?
Come on. Let's go, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	Er... H-Hey! Wait up!	
Message	None	"(T-Tohka... what's going on? I swear that monument
just glowed, but...)"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what is it?	
Message	Shido	Um... Are you all right?	
Message	Tohka	What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	"Well, just now at Tengu Tower you were acting
strange... But if you're fine, I guess it doesn't
matter."	
Message	Tohka	"What on earth? I would say you are the one acting
quite strange today, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Oof... I-I'm the one acting strange...?	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Shido, Tohka-chan, good morning.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Rinne. Morning.	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Rinne, good morning!	
Message	Rinne	"Were you able to wake up all right? Someone woke
you up, huh?"	
Message	Shido	"Ahh... you know me so well.
Kotori knocked me awake."	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. But you had a proper breakfast, right?
Did you make lunch, too?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, we did... Er, Rinne, when you're acting like
this, you're almost like a mom, you know?"	
Message	Rinne	Huh, really? D-Do I sound like an old lady?	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not how I meant it. I feel like if you
got married, you'd be able to fully support your
family."	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Shido? Will you take my hand?	
Message	Shido	Huh?! I-I wasn't talking about it like that...!	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh... I'm just kidding.
Tohka's going to get angry, you know."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha... Sorry, sorry... Wait, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm...	
Message	Shido	Hm, what's wrong?	
Message	Tohka	I-It's nothing!	
Message	Shido	I-I see... It doesn't look like nothing, but...	
Message	Rinne	Hehe...	
Message	Ai	"Whoa, there! Itsuka-kun had a lovey-dovey walk to
school with Tohka? That ain't cheap, you know!"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's all this?!	
Message	Ai	Tohka-chan, you're working hard!	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes! I'm giving it my all!	
Message	Mai	"Don't worry, Tohka-chan! If we put some polish
on that innocent otome heart of yours,
then no one can stop you!"	
Message	Tohka	R-Really? I hope so.	
Message	Shido	What are you guys talking about?	
Message	Mii	"There are some things in this
world best left unknown..."	
Message	Shido	"You guys better not be filling Tohka's head with a
bunch of weird things, all right?"	
Message	Ai	"Hey! Could you not be rude? When have we ever told
Tohka weird things?"	
Message	Mai	Yeah, that's a false accusation!	
Message	Mai	"It's because of our flawless backup that you're
able to spend your time ogling and fawning over
her, Itsuka-kun!"	
Message	Shido	F-Fawning... I'm not really―	
Message	Mii	"So ungrateful, even though it's thanks to us that
you're even standing there breathing..."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What on earth kind of existence are you guys?!	
Message	Mii	"You'd better not anger us too much...
Be sure to sleep with one eye open."	
Message	Shido	That's seriously just straight-up scary!	
Message	Ai	"Either way, don't take your eyes off Tohka-chan's
efforts for even a moment, Itsuka-kun! Got it?!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Mai	"If you ever make Tohka-chan cry, I'll ask my mom
to string you up from the ceiling!"	
Message	Shido	Wha—?!	
Message	Mai	"Until you cry and beg, ""Please, forgive me!"" we'll
run electricity from a car battery through you!"	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What the hell did you learn
from your mother...?!"	
Message	Mii	"In the underworld of society, betrayal is the
highest crime... When it comes to that,
we won't let you die easily."	
Message	Shido	Wha...?	
Message	Mii	"A honey bee's poison is slight. To die, you'd need
to be stung in a thousand different places. Rest
assured, I have the required amount of bees..."	
Message	Shido	AS IF THAT'S REASSURING AT ALL!!	
Message	Ai	"That's how it is. So, Itsuka-kun, you'd better
make sure you walk to school to—ge—ther with
Tohka-chan from now on! You got it?!"	
Message	None	(What the hell was all that...?!)	
Message	Tohka	Shido? What were you talking about?	
Message	Shido	Th-That's what I want to know.	
Message	Tohka	Hm, I see...	
Message	Origami	Shido, did you walk to school with Tohka Yatogami?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Y-Yeah... I did, but...	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	None	"(Hey, now... I'm not out of the frying pan and
into the fire, am I?)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm...? Do you have some business here, Origami
Tobiichi?"	
Message	Origami	Not really.	
Message	None	(Whew... Looks like that's not the case.)	
Message	Tohka	Hmph...!	
Message	Rinne	"Tohka-chan... The bell rang, so maybe you should
sit down?"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...!	
Message	None	"(I-Is it just my imagination, or am I in more
and more danger every day?)"
