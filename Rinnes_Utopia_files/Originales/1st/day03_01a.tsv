Message	None	...	
Message	None	Not this dream again...	
Message	None	All I could do is watch.	
Message	None	...Watch?	
Message	None	...	
Message	None	Why...?	
Message	None	So that my sorrow doesn't spread...	
Message	None	Sorrow...? What do you mean...?	
Message	None	There's no need for you to understand.	
Message	None	WHAT...?!	
Message	None	All can only be allowed by Eden.	
Message	None	Hey, that doesn't make any se—	
Message	None	(Huh... my consciousness is fading...)	
Message	None	You... Just focus on trusting me.	
Message	None	"(How can I trust you? I don't even know you...
*grunt*...)"	
Message	Shido	Urngh...	
Message	Shido	Y-You're—!	
Message	???	...do?! ...ay?	
Message	Shido	WHO... are you?!	
Message	???	Aah!	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	U-Um... Sh-Shido?	
Message	Shido	Aah!!	
Message	Rinne	...!	
Message	Shido	"WHOA! SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSorry!
Rinne!"	
Message	Rinne	Oh... It's okay. You startled me... a bit.	
Message	Shido	"I'm so sorry! Gosh, what's gotten into me
between yesterday and today?! Maybe it's
because I've been having weird dreams...?"	
Message	Rinne	Weird dreams...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, never mind. Anyways... I'm so sorry!	
Message	Rinne	"Ah. So you were daydreaming, huh? Shido,
you're like a child."	
Message	Shido	Man... I don't have a rebuttal for that.	
Message	Rinne	Shido... Maybe you're tired.	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm fine. Maybe it's because I haven't
been moving about much lately."	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. So long as you're fine. Anyways, I'll
be waiting for you downstairs, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Shido	Hey, where's everyone?	
Message	Rinne	"About that. Yoshino-chan was feeling ill all of
a sudden. Kotori-chan took her to the hospital
this morning. I told them I'd join, but..."	
Message	Shido	Wait, Yoshino?! Is she okay?	
Message	Rinne	"Hmm, Kotori-chan says it's not a big deal,
but..."	
Message	Shido	Oh... I'm worried.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah...	
Message	None	"(I assume that Kotori took her to the Fraxinus.
Then she should be fine, but...)"	
Message	Shido	And what about Tohka? Is she sleeping in?	
Message	Rinne	"No. Tohka said she's going ahead to school
and had already left."	
Message	Shido	"What?! Are you serious?! Th-That's strange
of her!"	
Message	Rinne	"What, don't act so surprised. That's not fair
to Tohka-chan."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I didn't mean it that way...	
Message	None	"(If something happened to Yoshino, that
means something could also happen to Tohk—
no, Kotori would've taken her as well...)"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, sit down. I'll bring your breakfast.	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay. Thanks...	
Message	None	"(Everyone's gone, which means I'll be
eating breakfast alone with Rinne today.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Here you go. I reheated the miso soup.
The rice is hot, too."	
Message	Shido	Cool, thanks. I'll dig right in.	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry. I was in such a rush this morning.
I only have bacon, eggs, and salad."	
Message	Shido	"No, that's plenty. Besides, Yoshino got sick.
I'm sure it was hectic..."	
Message	None	(Rather, I feel bad for sleeping in.)	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, but I found time to prepare a quick lunch.
So please take some. It'd be nice if you could
also take Tohka-chan's too."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, okay. Gosh, you do everything for us.
Thanks."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. No problem.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Um...	
Message	Rinne	What is it?	
Message	Shido	Oh, well...	
Message	None	"(Aww... I wanted to chat with her while we
ate, but—of course—I can't think of anything
to say!)"	
Message	Rinne	"What's the matter, Shido? You're looking
red. Do you have another fever?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's not like that! I-It's fine.	
Message	Rinne	Really? That's good. You seem off today, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Oh... Um, sorry.	
Message	Rinne	"No need to apologize. You're so weird,
Shido. Hehe..."	
Message	None	"(Man, I'm so embarrassed. I-I know! I'll
turn on the TV!)"	
Message	Newscaster	"Now, for our next top story..."	
Message	None	"(I felt some relief as the sound from the TV
began to fill the silence hovering between us.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come to think of it, don't you have
morning practice?"	
Message	None	"(Until yesterday, Rinne normally would've
left the house by now. If we take too much
time, she might be late again.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, I have today off. Sports Day is done,
considering how testing's about to start."	
Message	Shido	Oh, now that you mention it, you're right...	
Message	Rinne	Did you forget about the tests?	
Message	Shido	"It's not like that, but... Hm? Does that mean
you've got more free time today?"	
Message	Rinne	"Uh... I wish, but I've got some errands to run,
so I have to leave a bit early. Sorry."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no worries. If you didn't have morning
practice, I figured we could head to school
together. That's all."	
Message	Rinne	Oh... I wish I could, but...	
Message	Shido	Don't worry about it.	
Message	Newscaster	"This is an emergency broadcast. An unidentified\nmale has attacked the post office, taking a few\nof the workers hostage..."	
Message	Shido	"What?! Seriously?! Is this happening right
now?!"	
Message	None	"(I did a double-take upon hearing the news,
and I stared at the TV.)"	
Message	None	"(Displayed on the screen was the supposed
post office where the incident was occurring.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Isn't that the post office in front of the
station..."	
Message	Newscaster	"Negotiations are currently on-going, but the\nculprit has yet to be apprehended..."	
Message	Shido	"This is so dangerous... I'm worried about
the hostages."	
Message	Rinne	"But... you don't know any of them, do you,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"That doesn't matter. I just don't want to hear
about anyone getting hurt."	
Message	Rinne	You're right...	
Message	Newscaster	"...Oh, we have breaking news from the\nsite of the incident. Miyasaka-san? Studio\nhere, any updates on your side?"	
Message	Reporter	"Yes! I'm at the site right now! Is the feed\ncoming in? Just now! The unidentified male\nhas turned himself in and released the hostages!"	
Message	Shido	Wh-Whaaaaat?! Seriously?!	
Message	None	"(On the screen, we watched the man being
handcuffed and escorted by the authorities.)"	
Message	None	"(It almost felt like some prank reality show.
The turn of events was so sudden that it
hadn't seemed real...)"	
Message	Rinne	"I'm just glad he was arrested before anyone
was hurt."	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? Oh yeah. You're right, huh...
That is a relief..."	
Message	Rinne	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"It's hard to explain, but... The timing almost
seemed too convenient."	
Message	Rinne	"I see what you mean, but had it continued,
we couldn't have gone shopping near the
station, so it works out in my favor."	
Message	Shido	Rinne... You're so happy-go-lucky.	
Message	Rinne	"You say that, but it's you who'd be upset if
I couldn't buy groceries for dinner tonight."	
Message	Shido	"Ah. You've got a point. That's absolutely
right..."	
Message	Rinne	Very well. Glad we're on the same page, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hey, it seems like you're patronizing me...	
Message	Rinne	That's all in your head. ♪
