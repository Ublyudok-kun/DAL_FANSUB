Message	Tonomachi	Oh! It's already started! Our class is up for the scrimmage!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey look, Itsuka! Ahhh! Their shorts are so great!
Shorts like that are a healthy male's romance!
Rather, it's their muse! No! It's the ultimate gift!"	
Message	Shido	"Don't you ever think about anything else?
It's always the same thing with you."	
Message	Tonomachi	"But I mean, look! Look at Tobiichi's shorts!
Not even the ultimate master can copy that...
That is crazy!"	
Message	Shido	What are you comparing her with?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Now now! Let's cheer her on! GOOOOO!
Go fight win! SHORTS!!
Go fight win! SHORTS!!"	
Message	Shido	"You know... You're playing hooky.
The least you can do is cheer them on..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Don't be such a stiff, Itsuka. My cheering will get
them so pumped! Alright! GO GO GO!"	
Message	None	"(H-He's so far gone. Seriously.
I'm going to pretend I don't know him... Yeah...)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh? Tobiichi, why isn't she on offense?
She keeps going to pick up the ball."	
Message	Shido	It's probably because she's a Libero.	
Message	Tonomachi	Libero? Like in soccer?	
Message	Shido	You really don't know?	
Message	Tonomachi	Of course! I only look at bloomers during volleyball.	
Message	Shido	"That's not something to be proud of! There is
a position called Libero in volleyball. This role
is an expert in defense and they don't attack."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hm. What a lame role. Well, as long as I can
admire their shorts, I don't care what it is!
Let's go, shorts! Fight, shorts!"	
Message	None	(*sigh*... Can someone get him away from me?)	
Message	Guy Student A	Yo, Tonomachi! You're really into this, man!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah! Of course! Erotic things are the source of my
power!"	
Message	Guy Student B	"I see. That's nice. Someone on the soccer team
got injured, so I'm looking for a replacement."	
Message	Tonomachi	What?	
Message	Guy Student A	Can I take him, Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, go ahead. Do what you want with him.
I'd actually appreciate you taking him off of
my hands."	
Message	Tonomachi	"H-Hey! Itsuka! Why are you betraying me?!
I trusted you!"	
Message	Shido	Well, you probably shouldn't have.	
Message	Tonomachi	T-That is so evil! You're so messed up, Itsuka!	
Message	Guy Student B	Later, Itsuka. Come check out the soccer match later.	
Message	Shido	Definitely! Take care of Tonomachi for me!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Whoa! H-Hey, wait! I want to see more of those
shorts! I just waaant to seee mooore! Don't take
my youth away from meeeeee!"	
Message	Shido	Phew. Finally, I can focus on the... hm?	
Message	Origami	!	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! Amazing, Origami! You usually would've
given up when the ball got that close. She's
really hanging on there."	
Message	Origami	*grunt*!	
Message	Shido	"W-Wow, her physical abilities are amazing! Is she
anticipating the moves? She's always in the right place
at the right time. She's so good at this!"	
Message	Origami	HM!	
Message	None	"(The other team has some really good volleyball
players! They're really laying it down with these serves.)"	
Message	None	(That ball just flew past the net!)	
Message	None	"(It's not spinning and it's hard to tell which direction
it'll go. No one can tell!)"	
Message	None	(What?!)	
Message	None	"(The ball didn't fall anywhere. It passed the net
and is headed for the back line!)"	
Message	None	"(Damn. That's the hardest area to aim at. Origami,
the god of guarding for our class, was trying to
cover for her teammate who wasn't good at serves...)"	
Message	None	(There's no way. It's out!)	
Message	Origami	*grunt*!	
Message	None	(What?! It went... up?!)	
Message	None	(Everyone is screaming...)	
Message	None	(Did she make it in time from all the way over there?)	
Message	None	"(Right before the ball hit the floor, Origami
slid in and her fingers tipped the ball up!)"	
Message	Shido	T-That's incredible...	
Message	None	"(The opponent attacked right as that happened.
The player on the other team dipped down, someone
came running to spike it...)"	
Message	None	"(She blocked it again?! Origami... your speed
is absolutely unreal...)"	
Message	None	"(I feel like she's as quick as a bolt of lightning.
AST members really are that amazing...)"	
Message	Referee	15 vs 13! Game set, 2-2 wins!	
Message	None	(Aw... they lost...)	
Message	None	"(Despite all of her effort, the attacker closed out
the rally with a crazy smash. They were so close.
That was kind of a let down...)"	
Message	None	(...?)	
Message	None	(?!)	
Message	None	"(You guys? Oh... yeah, huh...
both teams tried their best. What a great game!)"	
Message	None	"(The whole gym was clapping, and I clapped with all
my might alongside them.)"	
Message	None	"(I clapped for our 2-4 volley ball team...
and for the guard god, Origami Tobiichi!)"
