Message	None	"(Hmmm...I thought I'd invite Tohka out on a date, but
it's hard to do so in the classroom with everyone there.)"	
Message	None	(――I'll try calling her from here.)	
Message	Tohka	Hm? So you were here Shido, I was searching for you.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh, sorry!
I was just thinking of inviting you on a date, actually...
But um, in the classroom people would look――"	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh!? A date!!	
Message	Shido	Wha...Tohka! Y-Your voice is too loud...!!	
Message	Tohka	Hm, was it bad?	
Message	Guy Student A	Tch, a date?	
Message	Guy Student B	Hah, man, how steamy～	
Message	Girl Student A	Explode...! Explode...! Explode...!	
Message	Girl Student B	S-Senpai!? W-Where did you appear from?	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka, let's just get out of school for now!	
Message	Tohka	Yes! So then, where shall we go today?	
Message	Shido	Let me see... Ummm...	
Message	None	"(If we're gonna go on a date, then for now a place
where we can be alone is good.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, this is quite a wonderful view, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"If we go even higher from here, it's an even nicer view.
Do you want to go?"	
Message	Tohka	I'd go anywhere, if you were going Shido.	
Message	None	"(――! O-Once again, she casually says something that
turns me beet red...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what is the matter? Are we not going?	
Message	Shido	W-We're going! Then, let's see who can get up there first!	
Message	Tohka	"Oh! You're challenging me?
As you wish! I won't go easy on you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	Alright, then let's get going. Ready...start!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey wait...! Tohka, stooooop...!	
Message	None	(*pant...pant...* W-What is this...?)	
Message	None	"(I've gone up pretty far, but somehow I'm
back on the original path...?)"	
Message	None	"(Could it be...maybe halfway I turned and went down a return path?
No, that can't be right, but...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm, Shido...are you giving up already?	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it.
It's just, our surroundings are..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Shido, is this not the same place we were before?	
Message	Shido	"Ah, yeah...that's right. It's possible we took the wrong path at
some point, and looped around the course."	
Message	Tohka	I see. Then shall we go once more?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah...let's go.
But this time, no competition, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Mm, I understand!	
Message	None	(...Alright, this time, we'll go slowly, without rushing.)	
Message	Shido	"This is strange...these stone steps shouldn't be this long...
Or does it just feel long because I'm tired...?"	
Message	Tohka	...S-Shido?	
Message	Shido	Ah, sorry...please wait a second.	
Message	None	(――This time, I thought I was careful not to take the wrong path...)	
Message	None	"(Or could it be...that I missed something?
Hmmm, for now, maybe I'll go on for a little longer.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Ah, sorry Tohka, just a little more――	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, is this not enough?
If it seems no good, let's turn back."	
Message	Shido	Huh? But...	
Message	None	"(This is obviously very strange...
It's almost as if it doesn't want to let us go any further from here...)"	
Choice		It bothers me, so I'll go on a bit longer.	
Choice		Tohka's acting strange, so I'll stop here.	
Message	Shido	"I'll make this the last time, so why don't we try going
up a little bit more?"	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka...? Are you listening?	
Message	Tohka	"...Mm, I see...if you say you wish to go Shido,
then I will go with you..."	
Message	Shido	Thank you, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Yes...	
Message	None	"(It's no use... The stairs won't end...
We should have reached the top by now.)"	
Message	None	"(No matter how far I look up, all I see are stone stairs continuing...
This view is definitely abnormal.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...do you not think this is enough?	
Message	Shido	Ah, sorry. Let's take a break here.	
Message	Tohka	...Yes.	
Message	None	(The moment I sat on the stone step, my consciousness became hazy.)	
Message	Shido	H-Huh...?	
Message	???	......	
Message	None	(――What...?)	
Message	None	(――This dream, I've seen it before...?)	
Message	None	(H-Hey, please tell me! Who are you? What are you――)	
Message	Shido	...You're right. We'd better head home for today.	
Message	None	"(It doesn't seem like she's tired,
but Tohka seems to be acting strange too...)"	
Message	Tohka	Yes...	
Message	None	"(...I wonder what's wrong?
This really isn't like Tohka...)"	
Message	Shido	T-Then, let's head back!	
Message	None	"(Unlike heading up, heading back down went pretty fast.
I can see the Takadai Park just over there too.)"	
Message	None	(Still...What was wrong with Tohka just now?)	
Message	None	"(Maybe...she's angry because I wasted her time?
It is right after Sports Day, I guess I wasn't thinking...)"	
Message	Shido	...T-Tohka, are you okay?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, with what? I am perfectly fine?	
Message	Shido	Huh? ...Er, i-if you're alright, then that's good.	
Message	Tohka	What is the matter Shido, you're a bit strange today.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...sorry.	
Message	Shido	?	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Rinne	Oh...	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne...!? It's rare to see you in a place like this!	
Message	Rinne	"Y-Yeah...! Oh, m-more importantly, what are you two
doing? Are you possibly... on a date?"	
Message	Shido	――Huh!? Er, ah, well...	
Message	Tohka	That's right! I am dating Shido right now!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Hrm, is it not okay to tell Rinne?	
Message	Shido	No, that's not it, but...	
Message	Shido	A-Anyway...what were you doing, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	W-Well...Um, I was maybe a little lost――	
Message	Rinne	――Eeek!?	
Message	Tohka	Ah...!?	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Rinne	...D-Did you...see?	
Message	Shido	I-I-I-I didn't see! I didn't see at all!	
Message	Tohka	S-Shido! D-D-D-Did you see!?	
Message	Shido	I said I didn't! I really didn't see anything!	
Message	None	"(Even if I had seen anything, it was an act of God...
Either way, I had no ill intent so...)"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Shido! The button on your shirt is about to come off.	
Message	Shido	"...Huh? O-Oh, this. It's fine, don't worry.
When I get home, I'll mend it back on."	
Message	Rinne	Stay still for a second, okay?	
Message	Shido	?	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Rinne	Here, now it should be good.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...thanks for always taking care of things.	
Message	Rinne	Hee hee, you're welcome.	
Message	None	"(Rinne, having been carrying around portable sewing tools,
quickly fixed the button that was coming off.)"	
Message	None	"(Her dexterity was very feminine, or familial...
I feel a little embarrassed that she did it in front of me,
but I also feel a strange sense of calm from her kindness.)"	
Message	Shido	Hmmm, I see...	
Message	Rinne	What do you mean by, "I see?"	
Message	Shido	"I just thought about how I feel like I understand why the other
guys voted Rinne for the "Girls I Want to Marry Ranking.""	
Message	Tohka	Hrm, what is that?	
Message	Shido	"Uh, well...there was once a vote on which girls
within school they would want to make a "bride.""	
Message	Rinne	I don't think those are very good though.	
Message	Rinne	"I bet Tonomachi-kun was the one who started it.
Good grief...he's always like that."	
Message	Shido	Ah ha ha ha ha...	
Message	Rinne	But...what sort of criteria do they use to choose?	
Message	Shido	"Hmmm...Whether they're good at cooking, or other household
chores I think? They said that's what they vote on."	
Message	Shido	Well, if you think that way, it's no wonder you're top-ranked, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Ah ha ha...that's kinda embarrassing.	
Message	Tohka	...S-Shido, do you also prefer those sorts of maidens?	
Message	Shido	"Hmm? ...Well, I guess I do think being more family-oriented is nice.
But if I were to like someone, that sort of thing might not matter."	
Message	Tohka	Hm, I-I see...	
Message	Rinne	So, Shido...whooo did you vote for?	
Message	Shido	――Huh? Uh, m-me? I uh...	
Message	Tohka	......?	
Message	Rinne	.......	
Message	Shido	"――W-Well then! It's getting late!
Let's go home!"	
Message	Tohka	Hrm!? Shido, where are you going!?	
Message	Rinne	Goodness...That part of Shido never changes.	
Message	Shido	*pant...pant...pant...pant...*	
Message	Tohka	Shidooooooo!	
Message	Shido	H-Huh? Where's Rinne...?	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Tohka	"Mm...it's nothing. Rinne is...she said she didn't want to get
in the way of our date, so she left for home."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Honestly, maybe she got too worried about
things."	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	Shido	? What's wrong, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	I-It is nothing!	
Message	Shido	?	
Message	Tohka	Shido! I will do my best too!	
Message	Shido	Huh? O-Okay...
