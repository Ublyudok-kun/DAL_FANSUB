Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	Hurry up.	
Message	Reine	"Hello, Shin. Might you be with Kotori right\nnow?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Yes. She's with me.	
Message	Reine	I see. Take your time, but this is an emergency.	
Message	Shido	An emergency...?	
Message	Reine	"Yes. You see, I've triangulated the location of\nthe enemy."	
Message	Shido	The enemy...?	
Message	Reine	"Yes... They are at Neo Tengu Tower."	
Message	Shido	"Enemy... Neo Tengu Tower...? Wait a minute!
What are you talking about? Enemy?!"	
Message	Reine	"I see. Shin, you must be affected too."	
Message	Shido	Affected? By what?	
Message	Reine	"Yes. Everyone within the barrier is having their\nmemories distorted. I hadn't thought that both\nyou and Kotori would be affected."	
Message	Shido	Memories distorted?!	
Message	Reine	"Yes. The monument you mentioned, Shin,\nis the keystone as predicted."	
Message	Shido	It was?!	
Message	Reine	"The result of our investigation yielded similar\nsignatures from the shrine and the outlet tower\nby the lake."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Reine	"At the center of all three points is Neo Tengu\nTower."	
Message	Shido	"N-Neo Tengu Tower is in the center of the
barrier... Is it the base?"	
Message	Reine	"Correct. Your memories of it are false,\nbecause that building shouldn't exist in\nTengu City."	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	Reine	"Remember, Shin. You know that something\nhas been off this whole time."	
Message	Shido	Wh-Whoa!	
Message	None	"(That's right. Why have... I forgotten all this
time?)"	
Message	Shido	I remember now. I remember everything.	
Message	Reine	"Ah. Wonderful."	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter, Shido? It's Reine, right?
Give me the phone."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Kotori	Hello, Reine? What's going in...?	
Message	Kotori	...What?! No, that can't be...	
Message	Kotori	"The enemy... I see. At Neo Tengu Tower?
Okay, got it. No... Thank you."	
Message	Kotori	I remember... everything now.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	That's right. There's something I must do.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Shido, I'm going.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey!	
Message	Kotori	"The only Spirit who can fight right now is me.
I've gone on a date with you, and my powers
are stable. But others can't, so I must fight."	
Message	Shido	But... we don't have to go right this minute.	
Message	Kotori	"Reine called you because this is our last
chance. Besides, this is my job. I can't escape.
I hope you understand."	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it. Then I'm going with you.	
Message	Kotori	"Of course not! You can't come. Don't you
know how dangerous it'll be?"	
Message	Shido	Even more reason I can't let you go alone!	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"You can't stop me. I... I'm conquering whatever
fate throws at us!"	
Message	Kotori	Man, aren't you something. And so stubborn!	
Message	Shido	Yup. Sorry, but I'm not budging!	
Message	Kotori	Okay, fine. We'll go together. Into victory.	
Message	Shido	Got it!	
Message	Kotori	Let's go, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Neo Tengu Tower... Who would've guessed it
was right under nose the whole time?"	
Message	Kotori	"Be careful, Shido. There's little we know
about the enemy."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but that's even more reason for us
to charge in."	
Message	Kotori	"I suppose you've got a point. If we're together,
no matter what happens, I won't regret it."	
Message	Shido	Bring it on... Here we go, Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	Charge!	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Shido	Were you in my dreams...?	
Message	Kotori	Are you a Spirit?	
Message	???	No one asked for this ending.	
Message	Shido	No one... asked?	
Message	???	"If only you were content to live in the idyll
contentment I created..."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Kotori	"Getting strong Spirit readings... She's the
source of everything!"	
Message	Shido	"She is? I don't know... I don't think this is
our first time meeting."	
Message	???	"I am the ruler of this world, Eden.
If you prefer another name, call me Ruler."	
Message	Ruler	"But... telling you is pointless.
I will banish you."	
Message	Kotori	Shido, get back!	
Message	Ruler	"Very well. You refuse my mercy. You are weak
and foolish."	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What, my Spirit powers... Wh-Why?!	
Message	Shido	Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Ruler	Scatter.	
Message	Kotori	Rrgh... AAAAAAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	KOTORIIIIII! Damn it! What happened?!	
Message	Ruler	"Farewell, Shido Itsuka. I hope for your next
dream to be a happier one."	
Message	Ruler	You promised me... you'd care for Kotori.
