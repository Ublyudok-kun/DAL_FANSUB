Message	None	<<No event data for today!>>	
Message	Tonomachi	Hi, Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	Oh... Tonomachi.	
Message	Tonomachi	"So... If you're free today, why don't we go find
something to do?"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... Uh...	
Message	None	"(It's important that I take the Spirits out on
dates... I can't just hang out with Tonomachi.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I have plans.	
Message	Tonomachi	"What the hell? What kind of business do you have
where you'd unceremoniously reject your partner
like this? We're 2nd place for best couple!"	
Message	Shido	"You idiot...! Don't say that, or people will get
the wrong idea!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"You never hang out with me anymore. Just because
you're Mr. Popular now..."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... Later!	
Message	Tonomachi	Hey, Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	Oh... Tonomachi, are you on your way home?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah. You see, I was thinking of going to check
out the Neo Tengu Tower."	
Message	Shido	Neo Tengu Tower? I thought it hadn't opened yet.	
Message	Tonomachi	"You idiot. Researching date spots after they're
open puts you way behind the curve!"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Tonomachi	"I mean, it's the #1 spot to go on a date with a
boyfriend, if you believe the conversations
of the girls I've been eavesdropping on."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Tonomachi	"That said, I'm busy today,
so I don't have time for you."	
Message	Shido	"You don't have time for me, huh... I don't recall
asking you for your time."	
Message	Tonomachi	"I just wanted to say it, okay!
God, leave me alone!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay... Sorry.	
Message	Tonomachi	I hate you, Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tonomachi	...Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	Oh, God... Tonomachi!	
Message	Tonomachi	Hehehe... What are you afraid of?	
Message	Shido	N-Nothing... I'm not afraid...	
Message	Tonomachi	"You're gonna try to sneak out today too, huh...
I KNOW! You're going on a date, aren't you?!
It's another date today, ISN'T IT?!"	
Message	Shido	Well... that's not the case...	
Message	None	(Well actually, it is...)	
Message	Tonomachi	"It's not fair that you get all the attention!
I'm tagging along today!"	
Message	Shido	What... W-Wait!	
Message	Tonomachi	No! I'm going, and I'm going to participate!	
Message	Shido	"Participate... This isn't a group date. There's
only one other person coming."	
Message	Tonomachi	*Grunt*...	
Message	Shido	"And think about it. You're going to be staring
at me hanging out with a girlfriend, while you
sit there alone... Won't that make you feel worse?"	
Message	None	"(Well not actually a girlfriend, but... Well, he
doesn't have to know that.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	D-Damn it... Itsuka... I hate you!	
Message	Shido	Phew... I was able to drive him away.	
Message	Shido	Huh... Tonomachi?	
Message	Tonomachi	Oh... Itsuka, it's you.	
Message	Shido	What's the matter...? You seem to be down today...	
Message	Tonomachi	You see, I figured things out.	
Message	Shido	What... did you figure out?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Nowadays, it's anyone's guess what's going to
happen, right? I mean, if a big spacequake shook
us up tomorrow, we'd all die, hand-in-hand."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are you getting at?	
Message	Tonomachi	"No matter how hard I work to get a girlfriend...
No matter how happy I make her—and I will!
If we die, it'll all be over."	
Message	Shido	Uh, Tonomachi? What's gotten into you?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, Itsuka. Even if you have a girlfriend,
you can't take them to the other side."	
Message	Shido	U-Uh...	
Message	Tonomachi	So... SO! Can't you spare me just one?!	
Message	Shido	...WHAT?!	
Message	Tonomachi	I DON'T WANT TO DIE ALONE! Itsuka! Share with me!	
Message	Shido	Typical Tonomachi... You're horrible...	
Message	Tonomachi	...Itsuka!	
Message	Shido	WHOA! Don't scare me, Tonomachi.	
Message	Tonomachi	Itsuka... I realized something.	
Message	Shido	...What did you realize?	
Message	Tonomachi	This world... is just a cruel phantom.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?	
Message	Tonomachi	"...Think about it. This world, everything is
unfolding so that you would have a good life...
Don't you think so?"	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Tonomachi	"All the cute girls are flocking around you, and
all I can do is stand back and watch in awe."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Basically... This world is a gal game where you're
the protagonist!"	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you talking about?! Jeez, everything
you say is ridiculous!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"GIVE IT TO ME! GIVE ME ONE GIRLFRIEND! Give me!
Or else you'd better date me!"	
Message	Shido	"L-Let go of me! And your last statement
makes no sense!"	
Message	Tonomachi	Ah! Wait, Itsuka! ITSUKA!
