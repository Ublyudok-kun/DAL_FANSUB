Message	Shido	Hey Kurumi, you here?	
Message	Shido	"She's not. I thought I'd find her here, but
I guess she's preoccupied."	
Message	Shido	I wonder what she's up to.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well. I'll give up for today. I have to hit
the market for dinner anyway."	
Message	Shido	Phew. I think I bought too much. Hm?	
Message	Shido	Well, time for me to start prep for dinner.	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Is that... Kurumi? What is she doing over there?	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Hm. She looks pretty sad. Should I... say hi?	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	"What if she's thinking about something
dangerous...? Should I keep an eye on her?"	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Reine	"Shin, can you hear me?"	
Message	Shido	Reine-san? Yes I can.	
Message	Reine	"I sensed Kurumi in your vicinity."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I was just about to approach her.	
Message	Reine	"You see, there's something I'm worried about.\nKurumi seems unstable at the moment."	
Message	Shido	Don't tell me... she's about to go berserk.	
Message	Reine	"No. Rather, she seems weakened. As if she\nis enduring something."	
Message	Shido	Weak...? We're talking about Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. Shido-san, what are you doing over
there?"	
Message	Shido	...! She's noticed me!	
Message	Reine	"I'll leave the rest to you. Be sure not to upset\nher."	
Message	Shido	G-Got it, but...	
Message	Kurumi	Is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh, uh... Nothing. What were you doing, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	"Were you staring at me this whole time? If
you noticed me, you should have said hi."	
Message	Shido	Well, you looked deep in thought, so...	
Message	Kurumi	I was looking at the sky, and the town.	
Message	Shido	Sky...? Town...?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. The sky and the town during sunset.
The colors at a time like this are gorgeous."	
Message	Kurumi	"I was staring at them, and it felt like I was
going to be swallowed whole."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, uh, um... Can I ask you something?	
Message	Kurumi	Huh? Sure, what is it?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, are you...	
Message	Shido	Could you be... lonely?	
Message	Kurumi	Lonely? Why do you ask?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. Well, um, you've seemed a bit
emotional."	
Message	Kurumi	Me...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Just seemed like it.	
Message	Kurumi	You... may be right.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I get it. Staring at the sunset gets me
feeling sentimental. Is it like that for you,
too?"	
Message	Kurumi	I am not sure. Is that all you've got to say?	
Message	Shido	Oh. Uh, sorry.	
Message	Kurumi	No, it's fine. I'll be on my way, then.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Be careful.	
Message	Kurumi	"Be careful, huh? Always so kind, Shido-san.
Thank you. Good-bye."	
Message	Reine	"Because of her abnormal behavior, I tend to\nmiss it, but one might think in this moment\nthat Kurumi could be a normal girl."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. You might be right.
