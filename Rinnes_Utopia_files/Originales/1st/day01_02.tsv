Message	None	"(This place is spookier than I thought. I'm
surprised some of us even showed up.)"	
Message	Shido	"Uhh, so Tohka, Origami, and Rinne are here.
There's Kotori and Yoshino. All right, seems
like everyone's here. Everyone but Tonomachi."	
Message	Shido	"What the hell?! The one who told us
about this place didn't even show?!"	
Message	Kotori	*whimper*... Onii-chan, I want to go home.	
Message	Shido	Huh, but we just got here. What's wrong?	
Message	Shido	Wait a minute, Kotori. Are you already scared?	
Message	Kotori	I-I'm not scared!	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. I remember when we were kids, you'd
start crying whenever we told scary stories. You
couldn't even use the bathroom by yourself."	
Message	Kotori	I'm not a child anymore... *sniff*... Wahhh!	
Message	Shido	"Okay, okay. Don't cry, Kotori! We'll head home
as soon as we give our offerings, so let's just
sit tight for Tonomachi, okay?"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, don't bully Kotori-chan so much.	
Message	Shido	Uh... I don't mean to.	
Message	Rinne	Um... Hold on, Kotori-chan. I'm with you, okay?	
Message	Kotori	O-Okay... I'll try.	
Message	None	"(I probably shouldn't have dragged Kotori
to this. I shouldn't have listened to Tonomachi.
I just felt bad for leaving out Kotori...)"	
Message	Yoshino	K-Kotori-san! Are you okay?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oooh, oooh Shido-kun. You can't make a\ngirl cryyy, but I know how fun scaring them\ncan be."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshinon! That's not what I mea—	
Message	Origami	...Shido, I'm scared.	
Message	Shido	Hey! Origami?!	
Message	Tohka	"Origami Tobiichi, what the hell are you doing?!
Back away from Shido this instant!"	
Message	Origami	"I can't. I'm too scared to move. I can't help
it."	
Message	Tohka	Ach!	
Message	None	"(Urgh! They're grazing my arm! Origami's
chest is grazing my arm!)"	
Message	Shido	S-Stop it, Origami!	
Message	Shido	Wha?	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... I'm frightened too!	
Message	Shido	U-Uh! Tohka? You too?	
Message	None	*grunt* T-Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	Shido, I'm even more terrified. Petrified, even.	
Message	Shido	"ARRRRGH! Stop, STOP! What's gotten into
you, Tohka?!"	
Message	Tohka	I can't lose to Origami Tobiichi!	
Message	Shido	This isn't a contest or anything!	
Message	Origami	Shido, I'm scared. Don't leave my side.	
Message	Shido	ARGH! Get away from me for a second!	
Message	Shido	"Listen to me. Don't forget why we're here:
To give our offerings to the Tengu Cow!"	
Message	Origami	I'll wait until it's over...	
Message	Tohka	"Sorry, Shido. I let my emotions get the better
of me."	
Message	None	"(Why do things always end up this way?
This is all Tonomachi's fault! As soon as
he shows up, I'm gonna chew him out.)"	
Message	Rinne	H-Hey, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Huh? What's up, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"While we wait for Tonomachi-kun, why
don't we all show each other what we
brought as offerings?"	
Message	Shido	OH! Nice! That's a great idea!	
Message	Tohka	Indeed! A lovely suggestion, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. You think so? Thank you.	
Message	Shido	"All right! Okay Tohka, why don't you show
everyone what you brought?"	
Message	Tohka	Sure! I brought this!	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, what is that?	
Message	Tohka	"A kebab sandwich I purchased downtown!
It's so juicy, even when it becomes cold. The
perfect offering!"	
Message	Rinne	"Wow. Sounds delicious. Maybe I could
try it myself one day."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. I'm sure you'd love it, Rinne! The scents
of meats and spices are unforgettable!"	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. I'd love for you to take me.	
Message	Tohka	Okay!	
Message	Shido	So Rinne, what'd you bring? Looks pretty heavy.	
Message	Rinne	Um... So I couldn't think of anything...	
Message	Rinne	"But I did think bringing food would be a good
idea, so... *OOMPH*"	
Message	Tohka	WOW!	
Message	Shido	A-A watermelon?!	
Message	Rinne	"Yes... They're not quite in season, but it
looked so delicious that I couldn't help
myself. Is that not okay...?"	
Message	Shido	"No, that looks all right to me. An interesting
choice."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Glad to hear it.	
Message	Shido	"Besides, does anyone even know what the
Tengu Cow liked? Feels like we're all just
choosing random things."	
Message	Rinne	Ohh. Great point. What should we do?	
Message	Shido	"Beats me. What CAN we do? Who's next?
Origami, what did you bring?"	
Message	Origami	A white lily. As an offering.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Now that's a fitting item. Nice choice.	
Message	Origami	You don't like it?	
Message	Shido	Oh, no. Personally, I think it's great.	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Um...	
Message	Shido	Well, next up is Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... I... I brought this!	
Message	Shido	Hm? A... cow plushie?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, come onnn. Take a good look, Shido-kun.\nSee how you can fit your hand in underneath?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see. So it's a cow hand-puppet.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yup. Reine gave it to me a long time ago.\nShe asked if I wanted a new friend."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Shido	Oh, so Reine gave it to you...	
Message	Yoshino	"I tried talking to it... plenty of times, but...
it wouldn't talk... to me..."	
Message	None	"(Well, Yoshinon's special. It doesn't
speak often.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's why, today, I thought I'd bring\nthe cow as a friend."	
Message	Yoshino	...It's lonely being alone.	
Message	Shido	"Right. I think that was a great idea. Hopefully,
it appreciates your sentiment."	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah!	
Message	Shido	So, who's next?	
Message	Kotori	...Uuh.	
Message	Shido	What'd you bring, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Hm. You first, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	Okay, I'll go first. Here it is.	
Message	Shido	"I brought a shortcake. It's from that bakery
downtown."	
Message	Tohka	Hm, Shido! That cake looks delicious!	
Message	Kotori	"That's a good bakery. Really popular with
the kids."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, I see. Then, I must try it one day!	
Message	Shido	So... How about you, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Mm...	
Message	Kotori	Feast your eyes... on THIS!	
Message	None	...?!	
Message	Shido	Hmm. I see. Hey! That's a typical lollipop!	
Message	Kotori	Haha. You're going blind, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"This is a limited edition lollipop. Not
just a "typical" lollipop."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	(I don't get it at all.)	
Message	Kotori	HEY! It's an offering, so hands off, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	Well, boohoo. Not like I wanted it anyway.	
Message	Kotori	WHAT?!	
Message	Shido	Why are you so upset?!	
Message	None	"(Boy, any day now... What do we do?
Tonomachi hasn't showed up yet.)"	
Message	None	"(He's late... Too late. He was supposed
to be here ages ago.)"	
Message	None	"(He'd better not be asleep. No, the girls
are here. No way he would miss this chance.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido, any idea where Tonomachi is?	
Message	Shido	"I don't know. I called him, but he didn't
pick up."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuuun. Don't tell me he's lost."	
Message	Shido	Hm. I don't think he would be...	
Message	Rinne	True. He was the one that insisted we meet here.	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Origami	"A phantom might've gotten him. It could be
the curse of the Tengu Cow."	
Message	Shido	Wah! You can't just drop that so casually!	
Message	Origami	"The person who invited us here has vanished.
How could it be anything other than a phantom?"	
Message	Kotori	*whimper, whimper*...	
Message	Shido	"K-Kotori? If you're too scared, do you wanna
head back home?"	
Message	Kotori	MMMM! I'm not scared.	
Message	Shido	Uh... You're trembling.	
Message	Kotori	I'm just excited is all!	
Message	Shido	"Okay, okay! Fine. I'll take a look around.
If he doesn't show up, then let's just drop
off our offerings and go home!"	
Message	Kotori	R-Really? Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. We can't wait for Tonomachi forever.
Wait here, you guys."	
Message	Kotori	Mmm! Okay!
