Message	None	"(It's too much work to find somewhere to eat,
so I guess I'll just eat in the classroom today.)"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, I forgot to give Tohka
her lunch.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Here ya go, your lunch. This is the most
important time of day for you, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hey! The most important time of day is when
I'm with you, Shido! Not lunch!"	
Message	Shido	Oh!	
Message	Tohka	"A-About what I said—! It's the truth, got it?!
I was only stating the obvious; not expecting
anything from it!"	
Message	Tohka	Nuuuu!	
Message	Shido	"T-Tohka! Don't say any more! Things will
only get more complicated!"	
Message	Tohka	Huh?! O-Oh...	
Message	Shido	J-Just calm down... Let's eat our lunch, okay?	
Message	Tohka	O-Okay.	
Message	Origami	"Oh no. I've dropped my lunch. I can't eat it
anymore. How unfortunate. No more lunch
for me. Big problem."	
Message	Shido	"O-Origami! Are you okay? I'll give you some of
my lunch. Do you want to eat with us?"	
Message	Origami	I will do that. Thank you, Shido.	
Message	Tohka	O-Origami Tobiichi! You did that on purpose.	
Message	Origami	"Unfounded accusations. What an unfortunate
soul. Only a twisted heart makes twisted
matters from such an innocuous thing."	
Message	Tohka	WHAT?! Did you call me an unfortunate soul?!	
Message	Origami	"A rotten apple spoils the barrel. Shido, if you
continue to associate with Tohka Yatogami, we
will become unfortunate souls as well. Be warned."	
Message	Shido	Well, um—	
Message	Tohka	GRRRR! You set me up, Origami Tobiichi!	
Message	None	(ARGH! WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN?!)	
Message	Rinne	"T-Tohka-chan, calm down! Okay? Here,
why don't we... all eat together?"	
Message	Tohka	*grunt* I-If you say so, Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Tobiichi-san, what do you think?	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. If Shido wishes it.	
Message	Shido	Yes. I think that's a great idea!	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, what a relief! Let's all put our desks
together and eat! Come on."	
Message	Shido	Phew... That was a close one. Thanks, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	You're welcome.	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. I guess being too popular has its
downside."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Rinne	Nothing at all... Hehe.	
Message	Shido	"Hey Origami, feel free to take anything you
want from my lunch."	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, Tobiichi-san, I don't know if you'd like it,
but you can also eat from my lunch as well."	
Message	Origami	No need. I'm just fine with Shido's lunch.	
Message	Rinne	O-Oh, really...?	
Message	Shido	"I don't think I've got enough food here.
Don't be shy, take some from Rinne."	
Message	Origami	If you say so, Shido.	
Message	Rinne	Here you go, Tobiichi-san.	
Message	Tohka	W-Wait!	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Tohka	"Goodness. Very well, Origami Tobiichi...
Y-You can have some of mine, too..."	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...?	
Message	Origami	...Is it poisoned?	
Message	Tohka	"Goodness! Wh-Who would poison you!
I was trying to be courteous like Rinne!"	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Like me?	
Message	Tohka	"Never mind! I-I was just being kind, okay?!
So just shut up, and take some!"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Origami, Tohka insists, so why don't you
take some from her. I think indulging her
might be enough."	
Message	Origami	If you say so, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Uh huh.
