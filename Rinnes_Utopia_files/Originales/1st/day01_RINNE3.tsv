Message	None	(Hmmm. Is he not over here either?)	
Message	Shido	Heeeeey, Tonomachiiiiii!	
Message	Shido	Where are you, Tonomachiiii!	
Message	Shido	Are you okaaaay?! If you're here, say something!	
Message	Shido	"It's no use. I don't see him anywhere.
Seriously, where did he go?"	
Message	Shido	"Could he really have been spirited away?
No, like that would even happen. Besides,
Tonomachi made up the whole Tengu Cow thing..."	
Message	Shido	"T-There's no such thing as ghosts, anyway...
Even if there were, I'm not scared at—"	
Message	Shido	Yikes!	
Message	None	(Huh? What? What was that?!)	
Message	???	Shido!	
Message	Shido	What?! R-Rinne? W-Why?	
Message	Rinne	"Y-Yep, it's me. I went to look for you, Shido, but
it looks like I ended up walking into a weird
place... haha..."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... That was bad for my heart...	
Message	Rinne	"I heard someone walking... I followed the sound and
there you were. I'm glad I found you. It's dark.
It makes me feel lonely."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, I'm glad you found me, too.	
Message	Rinne	You look so pale. Are you okay?	
Message	Shido	No... just... you know. But I'm fine!	
Message	Rinne	Really? Well, alright. What happened to Tonomachi-kun?	
Message	Shido	I haven't been able to find him...	
Message	Rinne	I can help you out.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Don't you have to go back to the others?	
Message	Rinne	If I did that, it would've just made my trip here pointless.	
Message	Shido	I see. You're right. Okay, let's look for him.	
Message	Rinne	Right.	
Message	Shido	Okay, so... let's check out that area. I haven't looked there yet.	
Message	Rinne	Alright.	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Rinne	We had fun at the pool today, didn't we?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I really like going to the pool in the summertime.	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan was so excited. It was really cute.	
Message	Shido	"That's so her. I mean, It'd be weird if she wasn't
that excited. She just loves that sort of thing."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe, you're right.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Something wrong?	
Message	Rinne	No... it's nothing.	
Message	Shido	I'm glad the three of us went. It was really nice.	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah, I'm glad to have gone too. It was so much fun!
Although at first I thought that... I might be in the way."	
Message	Shido	You seem really happy.	
Message	Rinne	"Oh! Um... w-well, it's because it was my
first time going out to play somewhere with Tohka
and... It's been a while with you too, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	N-Now that you mention it, it has been... Hahaha.	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Um... let's go out again sometime.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, me too... I want to go out with you, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	Oh, nothing! I want to go out with all of you again.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. But man, Tonomachi isn't around anywhere...	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... I wonder where he went.	
Message	Shido	Looks like it's no good. Should we head back?	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah, we should. Kotori-chan and the others
are probably starting to worry."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you're finally back!
Onii-chan, what were you doing?"	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry... I got a little lost on the way here,
isn't that right, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Kotori	There's no point if the search party gets lost!	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry...	
Message	Rinne	We're sorry, Kotori-chan!	
Message	Shido	"Still, I wonder where Tonomachi is...
What is he even doing? Gah. That guy..."
