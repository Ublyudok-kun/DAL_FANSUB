Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	It's morning.	
Message	Shido	But... am I actually awake?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Yesterday... felt like a dream.	
Message	Kurumi	Let me explain. I'll tell you everything I know.	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Whoever is responsible possesses a great
power. They and they alone."	
Message	Kurumi	"My body... The "nightmare" you know as me,
has noticed this manipulation."	
Message	Kurumi	"If I am able to absorb whomever holds this
power, then I will attain this power as well."	
Message	Kurumi	"The other me has been searching for their
location. She appeared to us as a clone,
just as she has appeared to you before."	
Message	Kurumi	And... I am one of them.	
Message	Shido	Man, I can't remember all of what Kurumi said.	
Message	Shido	Was it... real?	
Message	Shido	No, there is something I remember.	
Message	Shido	What I remember is...	
Message	Kurumi	"*giggle*... It's all your fault, Shido-san.
Now I'm a mess."	
Message	Kurumi	"But... I regret nothing. Because I've come to
realize the importance of spending time with
you."	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you, Shido-san.	
Message	Kurumi	I'm so glad to have met you...	
Message	Shido	No, that all happened.	
Message	Shido	I know I spent the last few days with Kurumi!	
Message	Shido	"But if her original body disappeared, then
Kurumi... will eventually disappear too."	
Message	Shido	What should I do...?	
Message	Shido	There's no solution, is there?	
Message	Shido	"I just want to see Kurumi. That couldn't have
been our last time together."	
Message	None	(I'm going to see Kurumi. I have to. Or else I—)	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! Hey, Kurumi!	
Message	Shido	Are you there?! Kurumi, come out!	
Message	Shido	Is she gone...? Where could she be?	
Message	Shido	"She always comes when I call her. I was sure
she'd show up eventually."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi. You're there, aren't you? Come out!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! Where'd you go?	
Message	Shido	She's not here either.	
Message	Shido	Then, am I supposed to wander for eternity?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi!	
Message	Shido	Where are you, Kurumi?!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, come out!	
Message	Shido	You out there, Kurumi?!	
Message	Shido	I searched everywhere...	
Message	Shido	Wait. Don't tell me she's disappeared already.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	???	Oh. Shido-san?!	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, what are you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	I thought it best not to see you anymore.	
Message	Kurumi	Before I knew it, there you were.	
Message	Shido	Since when...?	
Message	Kurumi	This morning.	
Message	Shido	"Gotcha. I'm sorry. I guess you were right
in front of me this whole time."	
Message	Kurumi	Don't tell me... you've been looking for me.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but it's fine now. I'm glad you're here.	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Did you come for me?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. I figured the other Spirits would find me,
but all I wanted was to see you."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi・Shido	Um...	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi—!	
Message	Kurumi	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Shido	No, you first.	
Message	Kurumi	No, go ahead...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Want to come inside?	
Message	Kurumi	Okay.	
Message	Shido	I brewed some tea.	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you... How delightful.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah? Anyone can pour tea. This is nothing
special."	
Message	Kurumi	That isn't true in the slightest.	
Message	Kurumi	Because you poured it, it is special.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kurumi	I hadn't planned to see you again.	
Message	Kurumi	"After meeting you, if my fear of disappearing
becomes reality, I don't think I could take it."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	"But I couldn't. I wanted nothing more than
to be with you, and before I knew it..."	
Message	Shido	I see. I wanted to be with you too.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, I have a favor to ask of you.	
Message	Shido	"If you're saying good-bye, then don't.
I'll listen to anything else."	
Message	Kurumi	"It may only hurt you, but even so, could you
promise me something?"	
Message	Shido	Sure.	
Message	Kurumi	"I want you to be with me until the moment
I disappear... That is all."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	I know you. You won't accept, will yo—	
Message	Shido	Of course I will!	
Message	Kurumi	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"When I woke up and recounted yesterday,
I immediately got up to look for you."	
Message	Shido	"All day, I ran all over town. You were nowhere
to be found. Unlike usual, no matter how much
I called for you, I couldn't find you."	
Message	Shido	"Honestly, I almost cried. Well, maybe I shed
a tear or two... Haha."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"If it's going to hurt me anyway, then I want
to be with you as long as I can."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"Didn't I tell you before? I want to know
everything about you."	
Message	Kurumi	"Goodness, Shido-san. What ever will I do
with you?"	
Message	Shido	We'll be together forever. Let's be together.	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you so much.	
Message	Kurumi	I...Is it okay for us to be together?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course. I'd like nothing more.	
Message	Kurumi	Then, please prove it to me...	
Message	Shido	How?	
Message	Kurumi	I have one more favor to ask you...	
Message	Shido	"Sure. We made it this far, I'll do anything for
you."	
Message	Kurumi	You mean that, right?	
Message	Shido	I think so...?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe.	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! Kurumi?! Why did you turn off the
lights?"	
Message	Kurumi	"You're so dull, but I suppose that's part
of your charm."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	What's going on?	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi? You, um, uh... Er...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san. Let me feel you.	
Message	Kurumi	Let me engrave... the memory... that I was here.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, I...	
Message	Shido	Ah...	
Message	Kurumi	Shido...san...	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I'll hang up right away... Oh?	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	None	"(Something feels strange. Like a haze or unease
in the back of my mind. Is it a premonition?)"	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise me. That you'll\nthink only of Tokisaki-san. That you won't ever\nlet her go. Promise me."	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, what Rinne said came back to
me. Kurumi and I were connecting here. This is
a moment to savor.)"	
Message	None	"(I want to hold Kurumi. I want her to know
this is where she belongs. I never want to
let her go!)"	
Message	None	"(I could call her back. It might be serious,
but if I answer the phone, I'll miss out on this
precious moment.)"	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Yes?	
Message	None	"(That's right. I already know the answer.
I'm going to...)"
