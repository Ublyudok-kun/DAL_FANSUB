Message	Shido	"Ah. I was going to invite someone to go on the
hill for a date but... I was so worried about Kotori
I couldn't end up inviting anyone."	
Message	Shido	"I guess today is kind of lost then. I can go
shopping then go home and wait for Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	...I'm home.	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're finally home!	
Message	Kotori	Shido? What are you doing there all by yourself?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing really.	
Message	Kotori	Weird... is the bath already prepared?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I got it ready.	
Message	Kotori	"Okay, then I'm going to go wash up.
I'm gonna be a while so don't worry about me."	
Message	Shido	W-Wait a minute!	
Message	Kotori	...What? Don't tell me you want to go in with me.	
Message	Shido	O-Of course not!	
Message	Kotori	Then what is it?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... well... do you want to continue
our date from the afternoon?"	
Message	Kotori	What? Now? What time do you think it is?!	
Message	Shido	"Well, our date was cut short wasn't it? I thought
maybe we could go on a walk. What do you say?
That's kind of like a date, isn't it?"	
Message	Shido	"Um... you're a Spirit. If I leave you be, there's
a chance you might go rogue, right?"	
Message	Kotori	W-Well, yeah, but...	
Message	Shido	"If you end up feeling the kind of pain
you felt before, I..."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Ah. If you're tired, we don't have to do it tonight.	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, let's go.	
Message	Shido	No worries, we can just... wait, what?	
Message	Kotori	Come on. Let's go.	
Message	Shido	Y-You sure?	
Message	Kotori	"You're the one who's inviting me.
Do you not want to go?"	
Message	Shido	N-No, I'll go! Let's go!	
Message	Kotori	Okay, hurry up and get ready.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	"It's been a while since the two of us have
taken a walk like this."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	"Before you used to be so happy-go-lucky!
You would just call me Onii-chan and follow
me around everywhere!"	
Message	Shido	You sure became a busy person.	
Message	Kotori	"I couldn't help it. We're the only ones who can
deal with the dangers of the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... compared to back then,
you're totally like an adult now."	
Message	Kotori	...Adult?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Going on a date at night like this
makes me think about how time has passed."	
Message	Kotori	Date? It's really just a night stroll.	
Message	Shido	"Oh? Maybe we should hold hands
to make it feel more like a date."	
Message	Kotori	"W-What are you suggesting?
I'm not some child!"	
Message	Shido	Oh. So you don't like that sort of thing?	
Message	Kotori	No. I don't hate it.	
Message	Shido	Then here... lend me your hand.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"What do you think? Does it feel more like
a date now?"	
Message	Kotori	How stupid.	
Message	Shido	"Don't be like that. This is a date.
This isn't so bad, is it?"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	What is it?	
Message	Shido	"I feel like I get where you're at, but...
don't push yourself too much, okay?"	
Message	Kotori	I know.	
Message	Shido	If there's anything I can do, let me know.	
Message	Shido	I'll do anything.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori... are you listening?	
Message	Kotori	I see. You said anything, right? Good.	
Message	Shido	"What? Oh, maybe not... anything!
Forget I said that!"	
Message	Kotori	"Too late. I heard it already. I'll be
counting on you Onii-chan."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha...
