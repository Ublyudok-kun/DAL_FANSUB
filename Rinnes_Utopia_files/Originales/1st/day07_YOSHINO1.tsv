Message	Shido	Mmmm...ne...	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	"...Ack?! W-What is it?!
Is it the enemy?! An enemy attack?!"	
Message	Shido	"...Oh. It's you, Yoshino. What's wrong?
Sun's barely up."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I thought of it! What I can... do for...
Yoshi...non... for Yoshinon!"	
Message	Shido	R-Really?!	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, were you... thinking about it,
for a long time?"	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes.	
Message	Shido	You haven't slept much, have you?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm fine... It's for Yoshinon, after all...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, you're amazing. I'm surprised.	
Message	Yoshino	Th-That's not... true...	
Message	Shido	"No, you really are amazing. You're trying your
hardest... for someone who means a lot to you."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	"Is it all right if I ask what it is you're going
to do for Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yes. U-Um... Well, it's... it's a drawing,
a picture."	
Message	Shido	A picture...?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes! I'll draw... a picture of Yoshinon.	
Message	Shido	Um...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino wants to draw a picture of Yoshinon...
For Yoshinon's sake?)"	
Message	None	"(To be honest, I don't really get it, but...
It's something that Yoshino tried her best on.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshino, who has trouble with communication,
is doing this for her friend Yoshinon, so I can't
put a damper on it.)"	
Message	Shido	"...I think it's good. It's easy to put your heart
into something like a drawing."	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um, before, at the shopping district, I
saw... something. About a picture. For
someone important to you."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I see now. I'm sure Yoshinon's gonna
love it."	
Message	Yoshino	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, absolutely.	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Then, we'll have to prepare something to
draw with. Do we have anything?"	
Message	None	"(If I remember correctly, Kotori had a set
of crayons from way back when...)"	
Message	Shido	Just wait a moment, Yoshino. I'll go grab them.	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay!	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	...Hey, that's good.	
Message	Yoshino	I-Is it really...? I'll try even harder!	
Message	None	"(As usual, Yoshino was still wearing Yoshinon
on her left hand, which gave her a little trouble
while she drew.)"	
Message	None	"(But even so, it's not like she could take
Yoshino off.)"	
Message	Shido	Do you need any help?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm fine!	
Message	Shido	I see. If you say so.	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yes! This is... something I have to do myself,
after all."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, do your best.	
Message	None	"(This might be the first time I've seen Yoshino
this frantic on her own.)"	
Message	None	"(She looks earnest, straightforward, and serious.
Both dignified and determined.)"	
Message	None	"(From the outside looking in, it might not
seem like much, but this is Yoshino's battle.
Just like how the dates are for me.)"	
Message	Shido	"I'll be going then. I'm looking forward to seeing
it when it's finished."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	Heeey, Yoshi—	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's really trying her hardest. Hm?
This is slightly different from what she was
drawing earlier.)"	
Message	None	"(She must've redrawn it over and over until she
was satisfied. It'd be rude for me to interfere,
so I'll leave her alone until it's finished."	
Message	Shido	"...How is it, Yoshino? Are you almost done
drawing?"	
Message	None	"(I called to her, but there was no response.
The picture, however, looked completed.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's drawn pretty well. And, Yoshino is...	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	"Oh dear, she's fallen asleep. You worked hard
on something that you're not used to after all."	
Message	None	"(She looks awfully content. Must've really
given her all into this picture.)"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(For someone unfamiliar with the situation,
it might not seem like a big deal—but to me,
it was the most wonderful of pictures.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's true emotions really come into the
fore of this drawing. She put her heart and soul
into it. Once she wakes, I'll have to praise her.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yoshino. I feel bad that you can't see how
amazing your drawing is right now."	
Message	Shido	"You better hurry and come back, all right?
I absolutely hope it's not by the time this
picture's faded."	
Message	???	"It's really done well, isn't it?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, isn't it? Yoshino really tried... Hmm?
W-Wait, Y-Yoshinon?!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aw jeez, Shido-kun. What's wrong? You see\na zombie or something?"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Yoshino! Wake up! Please wake up!	
Message	Yoshino	Mmm... What is it...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoohoo, Yoshino! How've you been?"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh. Perhaps you're still half-asleep?"	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san... Th-This is a dream, right?	
Message	Shido	"No! It seems like a dream, but it's reality!
Yoshino... Yoshino, wake up!"	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... Ah... Yoshi...non!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, here I was thinking that I was just in\nYoshino's way, you know?"	
Message	Yoshino	Th-That's not true!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hehe. Of course! Yoshino's everyone's idol\nafter all!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"If that's the case, then I really can't stay\ngone forever. And I did get a wonderful picture,\ntoo."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's choice was correct. This picture
really reflects how much Yoshino cares for
Yoshinon.)"	
Message	None	"(That's right, though. Yoshino and Yoshinon
are one in the same. They have something
that sets them apart—a strong bond.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon, please don't... ever go away again.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yup yup! From now on, we'll always be together!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino and Yoshinon... and Shido-kun, the three\nof us!"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that's right! ...Wait, huh? Me too?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, you're not gonna say you don't wanna,\nare you? Yoshino and Yoshinon, it'll be two pretty\npeople in both hands, you know?"	
Message	Shido	"O-Of course I'm fine with it. Leave it to me.
I'll take care of both of you at once."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um, Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Yoshino	This picture. C-Can I put it up on the wall...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's your masterpiece, Yoshino. Let's
hang it somewhere where everyone can see
it."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshinon thinks right there is good!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, over there...?	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, but I... think... here... can be seen well...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whaaat? But that wall over there's bright\nand dandy!"	
Message	Yoshino	B-But...	
Message	Shido	"Haha! Just make sure it's a place that both
of you can agree upon, okay?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Of course, of course! I really think over there's\ngood!"	
Message	Yoshino	No, over here!	
Message	None	"(For her to let her own opinion clash with
Yoshinon's like this... Yoshino's changed.
Definitely. For the better.)"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Whoa!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hm, Shido-kun? What's the matter?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, er... Nothing big...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Good grief. You're no good, Shido-kun.\nPutting it on silent is a basic courtesy,\ndon't you know?"	
Message	Shido	Ah, sorry. Um, Kotori...?	
Message	None	"(Something feels strange. A strange haziness,
or unease, in the back of my mind. Is it a
premonition?)"	
Message	Rinne	"Promise that from now on, you'll cherish\nYoshino-chan. No matter what happens, you\nwon't let her go. Promise me."	
Message	None	"(I suddenly remembered Rinne's words. Right now,
in front of me, are Yoshino and Yoshinon,
reunited at last. A moment I couldn't exchange.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm sure it's fine if I call back later. I hope
it's nothing important. I have to choose between
my duty, and missing out on something special.)"	
Message	None	(I feel uneasy. Why on earth am I so anxious?)	
Message	Yoshino	...Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(That's right. Of course, there's no reason to
waver. For the call, I'll...)"	
Choice		Pick up.	
Choice		Don't pick up.
