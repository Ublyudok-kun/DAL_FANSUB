Message	None	"(I was going to invite Origami on a date, but
I bet she's home already.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder why I can't invite her out on a
normal date. Is something getting in the
way? Can't be...)"	
Message	None	"(*sigh*... Not to be superstitious, but I did
pray at the temple. Maybe I could give her
a call. Origami's number is... Uh...)"	
Message	None	(—What?! Speak of the devil!)	
Message	Shido	H-Hello...?	
Message	Origami	"Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes...	
Message	Origami	"Were you not planning to ask me out today?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"Date."	
Message	Shido	"OH, um... If it's okay with you, we could go out
right now—"	
Message	Origami	"No problem."	
Message	Shido	Okay then.	
Message	Origami	"I'll wait for you in my home."	
Message	Shido	...Wha?	
Message	Origami	"Please come."	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Origami	Come in.	
Message	Shido	Th-Thanks...	
Message	None	"(Ah. Every time I go to her place, I feel dazed.
Maybe it's the aroma.)"	
Message	None	"(If I let my guard down, I'll become even
dizzier. Am I imagining things...?)"	
Message	Origami	"What's the matter? You don't like scented
candles?"	
Message	Shido	"N-Nothing. Besides, we're on a date. Are you
sure you don't wanna go out?"	
Message	Origami	Would you like to go out?	
Message	Shido	"Uh. Well, now that you mention it, I can't
think of any place in particular to go..."	
Message	Origami	Then, let's stay here.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Got it.	
Message	Origami	Here, there's no one to get in the way...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Did you just say something?	
Message	Origami	Nothing.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(I'm alone in Origami's room, and she's staring
at me from afar. Her gaze is piercing. Yeesh.)"	
Message	None	(What should we talk abou—OH!)	
Message	None	"(Looking over at the bookshelf, I spot the
books on barriers and dark magic.)"	
Message	Shido	Did you buy all those books on barriers?	
Message	Origami	"If you aim to gather pertinent information, then
you must pull from all relevant sources. Every
piece of useful information matters."	
Message	Shido	I see. Have you read any of them yet?	
Message	Origami	All of them.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?! That's amazing!	
Message	Origami	I merely skimmed through them.	
Message	Shido	N-Nice. Figure anything out?	
Message	Origami	As of now, there is one hypothesis.	
Message	Shido	Hypothesis?	
Message	Origami	This "enemy's" purpose.	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Origami	"Normally, barriers are cast to protect holy
places."	
Message	Shido	Holy places?	
Message	Origami	"For example, sanctuaries are housed within
barriers in order to protect its inhabitants
and allow them to train in peace."	
Message	Shido	"Then, are you saying that someone considers Tengu
City to be a sanctuary, so they're protecting it?"	
Message	Origami	"There's a slight chance. However, I cannot
verify its accuracy."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Origami	"A barrier is not limited to protecting locations.
Some are cast to protect people, and there are
even some that can kill others."	
Message	Shido	What?! It can kill people?!	
Message	None	"(Th-That's right. Kurumi's barrier, City of
Devouring Time, affected anyone who stepped
on her shadow. Their lifespan was sucked up.)"	
Message	Shido	"What do you say, Origami? Why do you think
the barrier was cast over Tengu City?"	
Message	Origami	Shido, don't rush for an answer.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Origami	"Without enough data, we cannot rush to
make any decisions."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Origami	"In order to corroborate my hypothesis, there
must be someone targeting Tengu City."	
Message	Origami	"There is also the possibility that someone is
planning to trap the many Spirits in this city."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh.	
Message	Origami	"One more thing, there are forces at work here
that are involving us beyond our control."	
Message	Shido	Hm... What do you mean by that?	
Message	Origami	"My suggestion is that someone in Tengu
City is being targeted, thus the barrier was
cast in order to repel an outside entity."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Seems like we're at the mercy of whatever
this barrier thing is, huh."	
Message	Origami	Right.	
Message	Shido	"The more I think about it, the more confusing
it sounds."	
Message	Origami	"How about we leave the discussion alone
for now. How about something... fun?"	
Message	Shido	I told you no!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"B-But... thanks for sharing this with me.
It's a big help."	
Message	Origami	"I do not mind. Any enemy of Shido's is an enemy
of mine."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	None	"(And so, our dated ended up being a study
session.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey Origami, are you really okay with this?	
Message	Origami	What?	
Message	Shido	"I know I'm the one who asked to study, but
it doesn't seem like you're having any fun,
so I got concerned."	
Message	Origami	"No problem. Alone in a secluded room with Shido.
That alone... is super fun... *pant, pant*..."	
Message	Shido	I-If you say so...	
Message	None	"(Is she really having fun? Her expression is
unchanged, so I can't tell. Hm.)"	
Message	Origami	...Shido, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Well, um...	
Message	None	"(I want to see a variety of your expressions,
Origami. Especially that smile... Though I
could never say it.)"	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Um. Being on a study date with you is fun and
all, but I was wondering if there was a way we
could spice things up a bit..."	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Origami	I do have something fun in mind.	
Message	Shido	You do?	
Message	Origami	In the bed—	
Message	Shido	I TOLD YOU NO!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(It's so strange. Her expression hasn't changed,
but I can tell she's upset with me.)"	
Message	Shido	"D-Don't give me that look. I'll do anything as
long as it doesn't involve a bed."	
Message	Origami	Really?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes...	
Message	None	(Uh oh. Did I make a mistake...?)	
Message	Origami	If that's the case—	
Message	Origami	Mmm...	
Message	None	(OHHH! Saved by God's grace!)	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry Origami! S-Sounds like someone is
calling!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hello, Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	"...llo? Shi—? —re you? ...jamming...tact\nyou—oka—"	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	None	"(I-I totally forgot! Thi-This is... Origami's
house!)"	
Message	Origami	Come.	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	None	(How did it end up like this?)	
Message	None	"(After my transmission cut off, she enticed me
in various ways.)"	
Message	None	"(For some reason, we ended up inside the
bathtub together.)"	
Message	None	"(B-But my only caveat was that I made her
promise that we both would wear blindfolds.
That should work! At least, I hope...)"	
Message	None	(Yeah, I won't think too deeply on it...)	
Message	Origami	Shido, I'm going to begin scrubbing...	
Message	Shido	Oh. Uh, okay. Got it.	
Message	Origami	But...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	"Since I can't see, I'll have to use my hands
to guide me."	
Message	Shido	Gotcha. Makes sense. Reach out slowly, and—	
Message	Origami	Here?	
Message	Shido	—PHO!	
Message	Origami	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh! Snuck up on me there, so... I was surprised.	
Message	Origami	Right. I couldn't see. Sorry.	
Message	Shido	"It's fine. I'm the one who suggested blindfolds.
If you're having fun right now, Origami, then
I am more than happy to oblig—"	
Message	Shido	—OOF!	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Sorry! Something soft tickled my back.	
Message	Origami	Apologies. I can't see, so I bumped into you.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Right. I guess it's hard to gauge the
distance. Can't be helped."	
Message	Origami	Then, allow me to resume.	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay.	
Message	Origami	Around here?	
Message	Shido	Yes. Yes, right there.	
Message	Shido	—Hafuu!	
Message	Origami	"My hand slipped. This body soap is extremely
lathering."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really. I can't see, but there must be tons
of suds. Origami...? Maybe take it slower, huh?"	
Message	Origami	Hm...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I mean, being blindfolded makes it a little
tough. Um, Origami, when your hand slips around
my stomach, it gets a little uncomfortable..."	
Message	Origami	I see. I'll be careful.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes. P-Please.	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Origami	"Since I can't see your back, I don't know how
much strength to use, so I can switch to
something softer to scrub you."	
Message	Shido	Oh... I-I see. Got it...	
Message	Shido	...AH?!	
Message	Origami	Are you okay?	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...?	
Message	Origami	What?	
Message	Shido	Well, I feel something soft and squeaky.	
Message	Origami	You don't like?	
Message	Shido	It just kinda tickles.	
Message	Origami	"I see. This is a cutting-edge skincare technique,
developed to reduce abrasion on the skin."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I see. Sorry. You're doing so much, and I
keep on interrupting you."	
Message	Origami	"I don't mind. As long as you enjoy it, then I
enjoy it. But you need to sit still, or I won't
be able to wash you thoroughly."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Origami	Then, I will continue.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(H-Hauuu! M-Must endure... but how?!)	
Message	Origami	Shido? How is it? Does it feel good?	
Message	Shido	Well, it kinda tickles...	
Message	Origami	"I see. Perhaps a little more service is required.
Sit still."	
Message	None	"(NUFAAAH! I told you... n-not to go so fast,
Origami! T-Take it easy!)"	
Message	Shido	"...?! I-I can't take it! I'm getting out!
Sorry, Origami!"	
Message	Origami	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Sorry about this, Origami!	
Message	Origami	It's fine. I had plenty of fun.	
Message	Shido	Oh, but I got the floor all wet.	
Message	Origami	Do not fret. I've already cleaned it.	
Message	Shido	Was all of that okay with you?	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I was just wondering if you had wanted
to bathe with me."	
Message	Origami	It was always my dream to bathe with you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(I couldn't tell because I was still blindfolded,
but I wondered if she was smiling...)"	
Message	None	"(No, I doubt she did. If she had, I could likely
tell from her tone of voice.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, it seemed like she enjoyed the bath
at least. Her skin is positively radiant.)"	
Message	None	"(I can't help but fear that it wasn't a good
enough date for her, though.)"	
Message	Origami	...Shido?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, sorry! Daydreaming again.	
Message	Origami	Next time, let's do it without a blindfold.	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	None	"(Origami, what's going through your head?
I feel so close, but the more I dig, the more
confused I get.)"	
Message	None	"(I want to know everything about you. I want
to see every emotion you have to give.)"	
Message	None	(And I want to see you smile!)	
Message	None	"(Man, what's got me so desperate? What is
this feeling?!)"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, what's the matter? You're beet red.
Do you have a fever?"	
Message	Shido	N-No, nothing's wrong!	
Message	None	"(Maybe I'm asking for too much. I can't force
Origami to be something she's not.)"	
Message	None	"(The Origami in front of me won't change.
I just have to accept her for who she is.)"	
Message	None	"(B-But... if only Origami could smile. ARGH!
I DON'T GET IT!)"	
Message	Origami	...?
