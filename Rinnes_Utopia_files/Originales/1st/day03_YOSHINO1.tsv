Message	Shido	Now then, I guess I'll go check on Yoshino.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Reine	Shin, it's an emergency.	
Message	Shido	"Reine-san?
What's wrong?"	
Message	Reine	Actually... Yoshino has disappeared.	
Message	Shido	"I see... Wait, what?!
What do you mean, disappeared?"	
Message	Reine	Well, she was at the Itsuka household until just\nnow... But just as I took my eyes off of her,\nit seems she managed to slip past.	
Message	Reine	Her whereabouts will be difficult to pinpoint\nnow... I apologize, but could you look for\nYoshino?	
Message	Shido	Yes, I'll take a look around the area!	
Message	Reine	...I'll leave it to you, then.\nI'll have a look as well.	
Message	Shido	"Is Yoshino okay? She's timid and doesn't know much
about the world... It's not certain that she won't
get caught up in some trouble out there alone."	
Message	Shido	All right, I'll hurry and look for her!	
Message	Shido	"*Pant, pant...*
Just wait, Yoshino! I'll find you!"	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... Sh-Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	"I'm sorry, Yoshino!
I'm in a rush and... Wait, huh?! Y-Yoshino?!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... It's me.	
Message	Yoshinon	Hey, Yoshinon's here, too!	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, you were in a place like this...
I'm glad you're safe. I heard you disappeared from
the house, so I was about to go look for you."	
Message	Yoshino	"Ah... I-I'm, sorry.
I had left a note, but..."	
Message	Shido	"Huh, really? Oh, but that's right... It'd be hard
to see from the Fraxinus."	
Message	Yoshino	...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's nothing. Just talking to myself.	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Umm... I'm sorry.
Was I not... supposed to go outside...?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. It's not your fault or anything.
A-Anyway, I'm going to tell Reine-san,
so please wait a moment..."	
Message	Reine	...Oh, Shin... Did you find Yoshino?	
Message	Shido	"I did find her. She was near my school.
It seems like she left a note, but..."	
Message	Reine	...I apologize, I didn't realize she did.\nI should have been more careful.	
Message	Shido	"It's fine, we found her, so it's all right.
By the way, what should I do now?
Is it better that we go home?"	
Message	Reine	...What do you think, Shin?	
Message	Shido	Huh? M-Me...?	
Message	Reine	...Yes, I'll leave the decision to you.\n Call me if anything happens.	
Message	Shido	"Wha, Reine-san?!
E-Even if you say that... Hmmmm..."	
Choice		Let's go home.	
Choice		Let Yoshino stay out.	
Message	Shido	I called Reine-san.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to apologize. More importantly,
it's dangerous to walk around by yourself, you
know? You shouldn't leave the house too much..."	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshinon	That's pretty cold of you, Shido-kun.\nPoor Yoshino!	
Message	Shido	"Even if you say that... It's a fact that Yoshino
is still unstable right now, so just in case..."	
Message	Yoshino	W-Was I... a bother to you, Shido-san...?	
Message	Shido	"Ah... Oh, no... I'm sorry Yoshino,
please don't cry!"	
Message	Yoshinon	You made her cry, you made her cry! Telling her\nto go home before even listening to what she\nhas to say. You're so mean, Shido-kun!!	
Message	Yoshino	I'm... sorry...!	
Message	Shido	"Ahhh, no, Yoshino!!
I'm the one who was wrong; please don't cry!!"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	I called Reine-san.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	"No, it's fine.
More importantly, for you to be wandering around
out here on your own... Did something happen?"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... I wanted to... go outside a bit...	
Message	Shido	"Instead of bottling up stress, it's probably
better to let it all out outside. I'll come
with you, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshinon	Woo-hoo! Nice going, Shido-kun!\nThat was quite a manly line just now!	
Message	Shido	So Yoshino, why did you come out here?	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Um... I wanted to take a... proper look at the
school. I was wondering... what everyone
was doing..."	
Message	Shido	"Doing, huh...? Well, studying is usually what you
do in school, but... it's not really that fun
or anything."	
Message	Yoshino	Studying...?	
Message	Shido	"I guess during break times, you also play around
with your classmates..."	
Message	Yoshino	That sounds kinda fun...	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's never gone to school before, so the
words ""studying"" and ""classmates"" don't really
connect to her experiences.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	C'mon, c'mon, Shido-kun! Yoshino\nis feeling lonely! Don't you get it?!	
Message	Shido	"I know you're putting on the
pressure, but... Umm..."	
Message	Shido	"All right, then, do you want to see the inside of
the school? If you'd like, I could show you
around."	
Message	Yoshino	I-Is it really okay...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Oooh, how stylish, Shido-kun!\nYou're quite the lady-killer!	
Message	Shido	"L-Lady-killer...? Well, whatever.
Then for today, as your teacher, I'll teach you
about what sort of place school is."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay, Teacher...!	
Message	Shido	"Haha, that makes me kinda embarrassed.
...All right, let's head into school now."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... Teacher...!	
Message	None	"(Now that I think about it, I'm letting an
outsider into the school, but... well, I'm
sure Reine-san will do something about that.)"	
Message	Yoshino	......!	
Message	Shido	"Welcome to Raizen High School.
It's fairly new, so it's pretty impressive, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah. It's big... and pretty...	
Message	Shido	"Now then, where should I take you...
Yoshino, first, this is... um, the hallway..."	
Message	Yoshino	...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Ummm, earth to Shido-kun? We can tell that just\nby looking, you know?	
Message	Shido	"Ah, R-Right.
Yoshino, is there any place you'd like to see?
If you have any requests, let me know!"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	Could it be that you have no plan, Shido-kun?\nYou said you'd show us around, right? Right?!	
Message	Shido	W-Well yeah...	
Message	None	"(Even the puppet's saying that, but where should
I take her? I'd like her to be able to experience
something.)"	
Message	Shido	"...Oh!
Maybe this place would be good?"	
Message	Yoshino	Music... prep room...?	
Message	None	"(Unlike the music room, it's set up like a regular
classroom, but there are some instruments
to borrow, and it's perfect for practicing.)"	
Message	Shido	"Since we're here, we can try out some instruments.
We just need to find the rentals... Here."	
Message	Yoshino	What's... this...?	
Message	Shido	"This is an instrument called a recorder. You put
your fingers from both hands onto the holes,
and then if you blow from here, it makes noise."	
Message	Shido	Go ahead, Yoshino. Try it out.	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshino	It's no... good...	
Message	Shido	"Haha, no one can play it well right away.
See, hold your hands like this..."	
Message	Yoshino	Like... this...	
Message	Yoshino	I-I can't do it... I'm... just no good.	
Message	Shido	"With practice, you'll be playing in no time.
Without Yoshinon's help, you won't be able to play
it well. Yoshinon, do your best too, all right?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hey now, Shido-kun. I'm always\ngiving it my all!!	
Message	Shido	Haha... Well, yeah... Do your best.	
Message	Yoshinon	Good grief, Shido-kun!	
Message	Shido	"But it might be difficult to play it right away.
...All right, Yoshino, I'll hold it from the left
side. Is that okay, Yoshino? Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	I guess it can't be helped.\nJust for today, okay?	
Message	Yoshino	"If you're okay with it, Yoshinon...
Then please do!"	
Message	Shido	"Right, thanks.
Then, go ahead and..."	
Message	Yoshino	...?!	
Message	Yoshino	I... played it...!	
Message	Shido	"That's right, just like that.
All right, let's try playing a simple song. Here,
from this note to this note, try to connect it..."	
Message	Shido	"All notes from here up, I'll move my fingers...
That's right, just like that..."	
Message	Shido	"...All right, if you can move your fingers that
much, you should be fine. Here, let's try
going through it."	
Message	Yoshino	...O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	"Ohh, you did it. It's impressive that you were
able to play this well your first time."	
Message	Yoshinon	You did great, Yoshino! You're so good!\nYoshinon believed that you could do it!	
Message	Shido	"All right, you were able to successfully play the
recorder, so let's leave it here for today and
head home."	
Message	Shido	"How was it, Yoshino?
Did you understand school a little bit?"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... School is... fun!	
Message	Shido	If you think so, then it was worth my efforts.	
Message	Yoshinon	......	
Message	Shido	"...Hm? What's wrong, Yoshinon?
You've been quiet for a while..."	
Message	Yoshinon	No, no, it's nothing～	
Message	Shido	Really...?	
Message	Yoshinon	...Hmm, well. I suppose, if I were to say\nsomething, You were clinging a little too\nmuch to Yoshino just now, Shido-kun～	
Message	Shido	"Wha—?!
N-No, that was just to teach her..."	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Yoshinon	Well it's fine, it's fine! It looked like Yoshino\nwas happy too. If Yoshino's happy, then I'm\nsuper happy!	
Message	Shido	Haha, it's kinda like you're her guardian.	
Message	Yoshinon	Aww gee, hahaha. Don't worry about it～	
Message	Shido	Right. Shall we go home then?	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay...	
Message	Yoshinon	......
