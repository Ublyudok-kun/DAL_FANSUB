Message	Tamae	"Okay. Let's begin homeroom to finish up our
day."	
Message	None	"(It's already homeroom, huh? The day's
seemed long, and yet so short.)"	
Message	Tamae	"There's something important I have to tell
the class today."	
Message	Tonomachi	What is it?	
Message	Tamae	"Uh, well you know about the self-defense force
at Tengu Garrison, right?"	
Message	None	"(S-Self-defense force?! I couldn't help from
looking at Origami.)"	
Message	None	"(Even though they're talking about her troop,
Origami didn't even bat an eyelash.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	Well, I know of it, but... what about it?	
Message	Tamae	"Some of their commanding officers reached
out to the school, so I have a message for you
all."	
Message	Tamae	"Um, it's somewhat hard to decipher, but
put simply, it seems that Tengu Garrison's
observation machine is malfunctioning."	
Message	None	(The AST is having issues, too?!)	
Message	None	"(Origami's expression still hasn't changed.
Maybe she knows. Well, that'd make sense.)"	
Message	Tamae	"Soo... There's a chance that the spacequake
alarms, along with other emergency alerts,
may either be delayed or won't work at all."	
Message	None	"(Wait. That's bad, right? Hm...? Wait a minute.
If both the Fraxinus and the AST are having
issues...)"	
Message	Tamae	"So with that said, if you ever sense something
off, please calm down and head towards the
shelter, okay?"	
Message	Tamae	"B-But... there's no telling when you'll run into
danger. Regardless, keep moving, stay calm, and
remember to follow the rules of "PRT"."	
Message	Tamae	"No Pushing, No Running, No Talking.
Do you understand?"	
Message	None	(What is going on with Tengu City...?)	
Message	None	(Is Origami okay...?)	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Tamae	"Okay. That concludes homeroom. Everyone
return home safely, okay?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey Itsuka! Let's stop by Konna Miller's and
peep at the hot waitresses with short skirts!"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, but you're on your own. I've got stuff to
take care of."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Aw, so lame. What's so important that you
gotta bail on plans with me?"	
Message	Shido	I have a date.	
Message	None	"(I couldn't bother explaining, so I left him with
that.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	What...?! Whaaaaaaat?! A DATE?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sorry. Later.	
Message	Tonomachi	DAAAAAAMN ITTTTTT!	
Message	Tonomachi	"...Wh-Why?! HOW?! How does Itsuka get so
damn lucky?!"	
Message	Shido	"I think you need to work on your personality...
Later."	
Message	Tonomachi	NOOOO! Piss off, you meanie! Forget you!	
Message	None	"(*sigh*... If Tonomachi just acted normal, he'd
probably be the most popular guy in school.)"	
Message	None	(Anyways... What should I do today?)
