Message	Shido	"I wonder what's gotten into Rinne today...
She mentioned she's going to run errands
this morning, but she's late."	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, sorry for taking so much time!
How's the dinner prep going?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Yeah, I figured you'd be late, so I took
care of everything. It's been a while so it was
enjoyable. But, how's everything going with you?"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, fine. Just fine. I just had an important
matter to attend to."	
Message	Shido	I see. Were you able to take care of it, then?	
Message	Rinne	"Y-Yeah, somehow. Sorry for not reaching out
to you..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, don't worry about it. This is how it
should be."	
Message	Rinne	But...	
Message	Shido	"Rinne, you don't have to always think of
our home, you know? Besides, it seems like
we're starting to depend on you too much."	
Message	Rinne	"I-It's not like that at all! I'm only doing
it because I want to..."	
Message	Shido	"Well, even if that were the case, it's test
week, so it's not good for us to rely on you
so often."	
Message	Rinne	What...?	
Message	Shido	"So I've been thinking... During test week,
I should be the one to step up."	
Message	Rinne	"Oh... I see. It appears I was out
of line then..."	
Message	Shido	"No, not at all! I can't thank you enough
for what you've done for us, Rinne!"	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	"But I also think it's important to have time
for yourself, Rinne. Besides, I can't start to
lose my touch, too."	
Message	Rinne	"I see. Very well, Shido. Once you've made up
your mind, I can tell there's no convincing you."	
Message	Shido	"Impressive, Rinne. You know me too well.
Makes everything easy."	
Message	Rinne	But... you could lean back on me, you know?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Rinne	"No, nothing. Anyways, let me wash the dishes.
I'm allowed to help, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. If we tackle it together, we can finish
faster. Thanks."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Leave it to me.
