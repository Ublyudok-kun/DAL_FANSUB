Message	Shido	"Excuse me! Rinne-san, has Kotori come he...
Oh. No one's here."	
Message	Shido	"I guess I can call her cell.
I wonder what Kotori's up to."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh? What's up, Onii-chan?"	
Message	Shido	Where are you?	
Message	Kotori	"Ah, you should guess! Where am I?!"	
Message	Shido	Well, I'd guess home or school... so school!	
Message	Kotori	"Haha! You're right! I'm at school!"	
Message	Kotori	"How did you know?"	
Message	Shido	I can see right through ya.	
Message	Kotori	"Ah. Amazing as usual, Onii-chan. Bye!"	
Message	Shido	Hey! W-Wait... don't hang up!	
Message	Kotori	"Goodness. What is it?"	
Message	Shido	Do you have a minute to talk?	
Message	Kotori	"Hm. I'm kind of busy... what is it?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, well, it's okay. I was just wondering if you
wanted to go shopping with me."	
Message	Kotori	"Are you asking me out on a date?"	
Message	Shido	Well... yeah. I guess I am.	
Message	Shido	You seem a little busy though...	
Message	Kotori	"No, I'm fine. I'm sure I'll be good today!"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah? Did you want to meet in front of the station?	
Message	Kotori	"Got it! If you're later than me we'll play\nthe punishment game!"	
Message	Shido	What? P-Punishment game?	
Message	Shido	"Wow... Kotori, what kind of date would play
the punishment game? I've gotta hurry."	
Message	Shido	"*pant* *pant*
I somehow managed to get here before her..."	
Message	Kotori	"Out of breath in the middle of the afternoon?
You're like a little gremlin."	
Message	Shido	Seriously? That's how you greet me?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, some attitude on you. Well, maybe I should
just let you let out your pervertedness in public."	
Message	Shido	That so? Oh... I thought you had a white ribbon on.	
Message	Kotori	What? Is that a problem?	
Message	Shido	"No. When I called you, it was white. It's not a bad
thing. No matter which one you wear, you're still you."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah... that's okay then.	
Message	Shido	"Forget the ribbon. Why did you change?
I thought you were coming from school."	
Message	Kotori	"Isn't this a date? Of course I'd dress
up for this..."	
Message	Shido	Mm...? Did you say something?	
Message	Kotori	...Nothing.	
Message	Kotori	So?	
Message	Shido	So what?	
Message	Kotori	"So where are we going? This is a date, right?
Take me somewhere already."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, yeah. Right.
Uh..."	
Message	Kotori	What? You didn't plan anything?	
Message	Shido	T-That's not true! The plan today... is...	
Message	Shido	Wanna go to a diner or something?	
Message	Kotori	"I didn't have high expectations, but even
that is a bit of a let down."	
Message	Shido	Ha... haha...	
Message	Kotori	Well, let's get going.	
Message	Shido	What? You're okay with the diner?	
Message	Kotori	"You're the one who's taking me.
I have no say in the matter."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Reine	"Hey, Shin... Do you happen to be with Kotori?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Y-Yeah, but...	
Message	Reine	"I knew it. Kotori had cut off her transmission,\nso I had a feeling that was a case."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Reine	"Nothing. I wanted to get a hold of Kotori but\nI couldn't get a hold of her. I figured she had\nbusiness and that she didn't want to be bothered."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Reine	"Can you tell Kotori that Kannazuki said he\nwants you over to Fraxinus immediately?"	
Message	Reine	"I personally don't want to get in the way of you...\nbut supposedly he has something to report right away."	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it. I'll let her know.	
Message	Kotori	What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Reine just called. She said that Kannazuki-san
had an emergency report and he wants you to head
to the Fraxinus immediately..."	
Message	Kotori	I see. We're going to have to cut our date short.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I guess so.	
Message	Kotori	Well, I'll head back now. Sorry about that.	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	"We were just about to go on our date.
She's always so busy..."
