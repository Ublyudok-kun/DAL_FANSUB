Message	Shido	How's the investigation coming along?	
Message	Kotori	"Today, I tested if the Fraxinus could penetrate
the barrier. If I can't get ahold of Ratatoskr,
then it's obvious that the test failed."	
Message	Kotori	"But to tell you the truth, I couldn't get
through."	
Message	Shido	So... you couldn't break through the barrier.	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah, unfortunately not. Even the immense
energy from the Fraxinus' basic and control
realizers weren't enough."	
Message	Kotori	"Even the Mystletainn was no match.
Looks like brute force won't do it."	
Message	Shido	Is that what's been stressing you out?	
Message	Kotori	"Th-That's not all. Unlike you, women are
not simple-minded beings."	
Message	Shido	Well, excuse me for being simple-minded!	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. If you actually had any depth,
you'd be exhausting to be around."	
Message	Shido	...I'll take that as a compliment.	
Message	Kotori	"*sigh*... Anyway, for now, it seems like
we've hit a wall."	
Message	Shido	"If you say so, Kotori. I'm sure you can figure
it out, though. My sister can't be beat. There's
no way she'd give up now, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"What...? Is this your attempt to cheer me
up? Can't you be more thoughtful?"	
Message	Shido	"E-Excuse me. Unlike you, I don't have a big
vocabulary."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. It's because you're always trying to
do something outside your capacity, but
thanks anyways. I appreciate the gesture."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... You're welcome.	
Message	Kotori	"Hm? Wait... What if I were to change the
angle, then try again...?"	
Message	Shido	Angle...?	
Message	Kotori	"Just like with you, Shido, it seems that
charging in from the front is ineffective."	
Message	Shido	*grunt*...!	
Message	Kotori	"When dealing with seals, that might be
the right approach. But this time, it doesn't
look like the case."	
Message	Shido	"Well, yeah. Seems like your original plan
didn't work either..."	
Message	Kotori	"The crazy thing is, it's impossible to project
a barrier this wide and this powerful. It's
practically undetectable to any civilian."	
Message	Shido	"But you couldn't detect it with the Fraxinus
or the AST, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"Hence why it's so crazy. There must be some
sort of a trick..."	
Message	Shido	Trick, huh? Trick...	
Message	None	"(I scratched my head in confusion, but
I couldn't think of anything...)"	
Message	Kotori	"By my calculations, there's some kind of
grounding to stabilize the barrier, which
they then laid the barrier on top of...?"	
Message	Shido	I see. I guess that's one way of looking at it.	
Message	Kotori	"But if we can't find the grounding, then it's
just an empty theory, but I'm sure of it."	
Message	Shido	Gotcha... Is there anything I can do?	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm... Well, if you notice any irregularities,
just let me know."	
Message	Kotori	"But... I guess that's all you can do. For now,
at least. I've got an agent far superior to you
assigned to the case."	
Message	Kotori	"Instead, leave everything to us, and focus on
stabilizing the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	Hmm... Right. I'm on it.	
Message	Kotori	Oh? Someone's finally learned how to cooperate.	
Message	Shido	"Well, you said to leave it to you. If I can't
trust you, then what kind of brother would
I be?"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	"N-Nothing! A-Anyways, if there is a grounding,
then the barrier must enact some powerful
kind of mimesis."	
Message	Shido	"Mimesis? Oh, like how a chameleon changes
its colors?"	
Message	Kotori	"That's one example. If it's only a superficial
camouflage, though, then it should have
been detected by the Fraxinus..."	
Message	Kotori	"Maybe it can't even recognize the signature
for whatever this thing is..."	
Message	Kotori	"It's totally blended into the world. I'm willing
to bet over the entire planet, almost embedded
in the natural environment..."	
Message	Shido	Then, how can we find it?	
Message	Kotori	"Beats me. Shido, use that tiny brain of yours
and give it some thought."	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry... Hey, how am I supposed to keep
up with everything you're saying...?"	
Message	Kotori	"In any case, I wonder what compelled this
person to generate the barrier. What could
all of it mean...?"	
Message	Shido	Hmm... You think it's to trap someone?	
Message	Kotori	"You mean like... the Spirits? You might be
onto something. It's possible."	
Message	Shido	"Well, if I notice anything, I'll be sure to let
you know. Kotori, take care of yourself, okay?"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah... I know.	
Message	Kotori	Then, I'm going to call it for the evening.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Good night.	
Message	Kotori	Good night, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori seems pretty overworked, but I guess
I should sleep soon too, or I won't last.
Time for bed..."	
Message	None	"(I finally started to think of what might happen
if I don't study for the test. But it's no use.
I can't concentrate at all.)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe I'm still not fully recovered yet. Even
though I'm forcing myself, I'm still
really struggling...)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe instead of pushing myself, if I just relax
a little bit, I might be able to switch back.)"	
Message	None	(...For now, I'll go to the bathroom.)	
Message	Shido	Yaaaawn...	
Message	Shido	Gah! K-Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	...?!	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait! I didn't do this on purpose! And why
didn't you lock the door?!"	
Message	Kotori	Why, you... PERVERRRT!!!!	
Message	Shido	GAH!	
Message	Shido	"Ow, ow, ow... I told you, it was an accident!
I was just spaced out and―"	
Message	Kotori	"I know. If you did it on purpose, you wouldn't
be getting off this easily."	
Message	Shido	Urgh...	
Message	Kotori	"You'd be arrested and taken away. Your face would
be all over the news. A certain friend of yours
would probably end up very popular."	
Message	Shido	Friend?	
Message	Kotori	"I figured he'd do it eventually; being called\n'Pretty Boy Itsuka' or 'Sex Animal Itsuka'. But\nto do that to his sister..." Something like that.	
Message	Shido	That's a weirdly specific comment!	
Message	Kotori	"If you don't want to end up like that, knock.
Even an amoeba thinks a little more as it lives."	
Message	Shido	"A-An amoeba... Anyway, I'll be careful
next time. But―"	
Message	Kotori	What?	
Message	Shido	Are you okay?	
Message	Kotori	What?	
Message	Shido	"It's just... You looked pretty tired
in the bathroom."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph, it's all over for me if I'm at the point
where you're worrying about me."	
Message	Shido	Hey, I'm being serious, okay?	
Message	Kotori	I'm fine. It's something else that's the problem.
