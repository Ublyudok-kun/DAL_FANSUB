Message	Shido	"Phew. I was trying to eat so that Tonomachi
wouldn't talk to me, but I guess I ate too fast.
Urp... My stomach's gonna be full for a while."	
Message	Shido	Now then... How to spend the rest of lunch time.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Next class is physics.	
Message	Shido	"I wonder if Reine-san needs help. She seemed
even paler than usual."	
Message	Shido	"No point in thinking. As long as I'm moving,
then my metabolism will do its thing, so I'll
go help her."	
Message	Shido	Excuse me.	
Message	Kotori	"Right, I know. There was a blip in this range.
If that's the case, then the region over here
is..."	
Message	Kotori	...Oh, Shido?	
Message	Reine	...What's the matter, Shin?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well... since my next class is physics, I
thought I could give you a hand carrying
supplies."	
Message	Reine	"Oh, that's right. That's my class, isn't it?
Sorry, I totally forgot."	
Message	Reine	I'll prepare at once. Give me a moment.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	What were you discussing with Reine-san?	
Message	Kotori	"Huh? Oh. I was updating her on the
investigating I'd done at the Fraxinus."	
Message	Kotori	I was about to uncover a big hint, but...	
Message	Kotori	*sigh*... Things aren't going according to plan.	
Message	Shido	Are you okay? You must be exhausted.	
Message	Kotori	"Right. Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
tired, but..."	
Message	Kotori	"Regardless of how I feel, I can't afford to
rest."	
Message	Shido	Oh, come on.	
Message	Kotori	...Are you worried about me?	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Kotori	...Oh. Thanks.	
Message	Shido	S-Sure.	
Message	Shido	Oh, yeah. I texted you earlier.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you did? Sorry. I was busy, so I hadn't
bothered to check."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Well, it wasn't a big deal. Just wanted to
see what you were up to this afternoon."	
Message	Kotori	"Hm. I'll either be at the Fraxinus later this
afternoon, or I'll continue my work here."	
Message	Shido	I see... Seems pretty busy.	
Message	Kotori	Yeah...	
Message	Reine	"Sorry for the wait, Shin. Let's head to class
now."	
Message	Shido	Okay. Later, Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	Okay. Bye, Shido. I gotta head to class, too.	
Message	Reine	Cool. Later.
