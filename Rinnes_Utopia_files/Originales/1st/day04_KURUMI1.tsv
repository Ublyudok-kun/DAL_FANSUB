Message	Shido	"All right. Homeroom's done, so I should go
on a date with someone today."	
Message	???	...Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Shido	"I could've sworn I heard someone call my name.
Did it come from the hallway?"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, how nice of you to notice me.	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Shido	Hey, come over here!	
Message	Kurumi	Huh? Sure...	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant*...	
Message	Kurumi	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Y-You know, you shouldn't appear out of
nowhere."	
Message	Shido	"What would you do if you bumped into Tohka
or Origami...?"	
Message	Kurumi	Were you worried about me?	
Message	Shido	No, that's not it. Huh?	
Message	None	"(She's right. Why was I so focused on whether
or not she was seen? Am I worried about Kurumi?
Or did I just want to avoid another battle?)"	
Message	None	"(Argh, no good! I'm getting stuck in my head.
I did so because I wanted to.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, is something the matter?	
Message	Shido	Oh, um. Nothing.	
Message	Shido	"Anyways Kurumi, why'd you come by my
classroom?"	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, well...	
Message	Kurumi	I wanted to be the one to invite you.	
Message	Shido	...Invite?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes... Shido-san, will you go on a date with me?	
Message	None	"(Okay. Gotta go with the flow. Seems like
Kurumi's changed, and is ready.)"	
Message	Shido	Got anywhere in mind?	
Message	Kurumi	"Anything is fine with me. I will let you escort
me, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(My heart jumped. She grabbed her skirt and
curtsied, almost like a princess—)"	
Message	None	(No, no. Wait! Calm down! It's not like that!)	
Message	None	"(I can't let my guard down too much. Kurumi
said she had a "meal" in the alley.)"	
Message	None	(Wait, calm down!)	
Message	Kurumi	What's on your mind?	
Message	Shido	I-I just can't think of a good place to go.	
Message	Kurumi	"Goodness. What am I to do with you?
That place will do, won't it?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	Now, after you, escort.	
Message	Shido	Okay. Here I go.	
Message	None	"(Why does it feel like I'm letting her take
control?)"	
Message	Kurumi	My! Shido-san, look! So many dogs and cats!	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. It's a pet store. Have you never been
in one before?"	
Message	Kurumi	"I have. Not often. This one looks friendly.
Here, come hither."	
Message	Kurumi	Look how friendly it is.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it's adorable. Oh, so you don't like
zoos, but you're okay with pet stores?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it's adorable. Oh, when you think about
it, it's kind of sad, isn't it? They're stuck in
a small cage until someone buys them."	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, don't ruin a fun date with your
pessimistic musings."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	None	"(But I wonder what she's really thinking.
Outwardly, Kurumi's having fun, but...)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe the alligator was just being mistreated.
Thinking about it, I couldn't help but smile.)"	
Message	None	"(*sigh*. Sure seems like Kurumi loves animals.
She's having a blast just... petting them.)"	
Message	None	"(She's usually so... mature, but looking at her
now, she's acting so free-spirited. How
precious.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"What do you think, Shido-san? Do you think
this outfit is cute?"	
Message	Shido	Totally. I think it suits you well, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Then, how about this?	
Message	Shido	Another good choice.	
Message	Kurumi	If I had to pick one, which would you prefer?	
Message	Shido	What? They both look nice. I can't decide.	
Message	Kurumi	"Unacceptable answer. In times like these,
women want your opinion. Otherwise, she'll
think you simply don't care."	
Message	Shido	Oh, point taken. I'll be careful.	
Message	Kurumi	I like that you don't make excuses, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	...! D-Don't make fun of me.	
Message	Kurumi	I'm not making fun of you. I meant it.	
Message	None	"(I felt my heart skip a beat. I could tell that I
was beginning to blush. Kurumi's smile had
that effect on me.)"	
Message	Shido	We've sure stopped by a lot of places.	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. I had so much fun that I've lost all sense
of time."	
Message	Shido	I'm kinda hungry. Wanna grab a bite?	
Message	Kurumi	Sure.	
Message	Shido	"How about crepes from the shop? What do
you want, Kurumi?"	
Message	Kurumi	I will leave it up to you, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Got it. Hang on a minute.	
Message	Shido	"It's been a while since I had crepes.
It was so yummy!"	
Message	Kurumi	That it was. I'm glad that I left it to you.	
Message	Shido	Right? ...*nom*.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kurumi	There's some cream on your finger.	
Message	Shido	Oh...? You're right.	
Message	Kurumi	Let me see.	
Message	Shido	K...Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	You can't move... Haaa.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi, that's enough.	
Message	Kurumi	No. There's still a spot...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi's cheeks were getting rosier. Maybe
she's excited, or shy. Well, I couldn't really
see Kurumi getting shy.)"	
Message	Shido	Ah. Okay, fine. Do as you please.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi nodded with an alluring expression.
My heart was racing.)"	
Message	Shido	A-Are you done?	
Message	Kurumi	...Yes. Thank you.	
Message	Kurumi	Perhaps, I enjoyed it a bit too much.	
Message	Shido	...Your face is red.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, is that so? Hehe. I was excited.	
Message	Kurumi	"Or, would you rather that I was shy?
Would you prefer that?"	
Message	Shido	What the...	
Message	None	"(Man, she can read me like a book. It's kinda
creepy. Either that, or it's written all over my
face.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Well, I need to go soon. Hehe. Today was fun.
I even satisfied my sweet tooth."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Hey, Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	What is it?	
Message	Shido	That "meal" you mentioned...	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kurumi	I must go. Something has come up.	
Message	Shido	Something came up?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I have to hurry, so farewell for now.	
Message	Shido	Hey. Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	"The crepe was delicious. As were you,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi... I forgot to ask her about this
afternoon."	
Message	Shido	HEY! WAIT! Kurumi...
