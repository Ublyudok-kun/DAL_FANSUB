Message	Shido	Wait... that cat...	
Message	Shido	"Every time I pass by, you always come up to me,
don't ya? So... how've you been?"	
Message	Shido	"You're so friendly. Are you really a stray? I wonder
if your owner just lets you roam around."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're going already? See ya!	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	You have a way with cats, don't you?	
Message	Shido	You always show up when I least expect it...	
Message	Kurumi	"Maybe the animals can tell that you're
a good person, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	I wonder. Who knows, really?	
Message	Kurumi	"Animals can instinctively read their opponents.
I'm sure this cat doesn't feel the need to get its
guard up around you."	
Message	Kurumi	"Some humans are scheming and terrible...
but I'm sure it doesn't look at you that way."	
Message	Shido	Y-You really think so?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I feel the same.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	"I know you wouldn't do anything evil towards me.
There's a part of me that finds it easy to appear
before you like this."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. I mean, there aren't a lot of people out there
who would so casually talk to somebody who attempted
to murder them."	
Message	Shido	About that...	
Message	Kurumi	So, Shido-san. What... do you think of me?	
Message	None	(Kurumi, huh? What do I think of her...?)	
Choice		I'd be lying if I said I'm not afraid of you.	
Choice		I'm not scared of you.	
Message	Shido	"W-Well... I'd be lying if I said I'm not afraid of you.
Honestly, I have no idea what you're going to
try and do to me."	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	"But I don't hate you. I still want to save you.
That much hasn't changed."	
Message	Kurumi	After all that's happened, you sure are optimistic.	
Message	Shido	It's because I don't believe you're evil deep down.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido, you're so naïve.	
Message	Shido	You think so?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Absolutely. But I also find part of you to be
comforting, and I think that is something both
humans and animals can sense."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Well, Shido-san, I'll see you around.	
Message	Shido	She's like a ghost.	
Message	Shido	"I don't find you scary... for now, anyway.
You are just like an ordinary girl, Kurumi."	
Message	Shido	"I want to talk to you normally, and if there's
ever a problem, I want to help you."	
Message	Kurumi	You still don't get it, do you, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Kurumi	"You can label me like that, but I definitely
won't meet your expectations."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	"Our sense of justice and equality is different.
We will never see eye to eye."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Kurumi	And yet, you are so honest. It really is interesting.	
Message	Kurumi	"Well, good day, Shido-san. I pray that your
kindness won't be your downfall."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...
