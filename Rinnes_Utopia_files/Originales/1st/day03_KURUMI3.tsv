Message	Shido	"All right, now that I'm done with dinner,
I should rest a little."	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What's that sound...?	
Message	Shido	Is it coming from outside the window?	
Message	Shido	Who's outside? Rinne...? No, can't be.	
Message	Shido	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	What, Kurumi?! What are you doing here?!	
Message	Shido	"Is she inviting me out? I guess I should go...
Well, but..."	
Message	Shido	Should I stay, or should I go?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	I should ask Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"...Hello? What do you want?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kotori? You aren't home, are you?	
Message	Kotori	"What is it, Shido? What happened?"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi's outside of our house.	
Message	Kotori	"I see, so Kurumi is outside of—WAIT, WHAT?!"	
Message	Shido	"Seems like she wants me to meet her. Is it
okay for me to go?"	
Message	Kotori	"If it's Kurumi you're dealing with, it\nsounds suspicious..."	
Message	Shido	But, we can't just let her be, can we?	
Message	Kotori	"I've said this many times, but you currently\nlack the ability to heal yourself. If you go,\nyou're exposing yourself to danger!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know, but...	
Message	Reine	"Kotori, I think you should let Shin decide."	
Message	Shido	Reine-san?	
Message	Kotori	"H-Hey, Reine! Why are you butting into the\ntransmission?!"	
Message	Reine	"Truthfully, I see no issue with him going."	
Message	Shido	Reine-san!	
Message	Kotori	"Reine, what are you saying? There's no\nway I could put him in dang—"	
Message	Reine	"No. In my honest opinion, Kurumi wouldn't\nhurt Shin."	
Message	Kotori	"How did you come to that conclusion?"	
Message	Reine	"I have extrapolated my decision from recent\ndevelopments. She has had many chances to\nattack Shin, but he's still safe, isn't he?"	
Message	Kotori	"You've got a point, but—"	
Message	Shido	Um, so what should I do?	
Message	Kotori	"Hm. Well, as Reine suggested, I'll leave\nit to you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Oh, man... What should I do?	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	Okay, fine!	
Choice		Don't go.	
Choice		Go.	
Message	Shido	"I'm dealing with Kurumi here. Who knows
what she's got planned?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I shouldn't be rash. I'll just ignore
Kurumi for now."	
Message	Kotori	"Finally. I think that's a smart choice."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	She's probably left by now, right?	
Message	Shido	She's gone. Now I feel guilty...	
Message	Kotori	"Then you should've gone. I didn't stop you."	
Message	Shido	No, it's fine. Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"Whatever's fine. I'll return home shortly."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi... What could she have wanted?	
Message	Shido	...I'll go.	
Message	Shido	"It's night time. Kurumi might be full of
surprises, but I can't just stand her up
like that."	
Message	Reine	"I see. Then be sure to provide a full report."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe. Nice of you to finally show up,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, what are you doing here so late?	
Message	Kurumi	"I forgot to mention something to you this
afternoon."	
Message	Shido	"Afternoon? Like, when I bumped into you
in town?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. The time in which you helped me up,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I remember.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe. Thank you for that.	
Message	Shido	Wha-What's gotten into you?	
Message	Kurumi	I realized I hadn't properly thanked you.	
Message	Shido	Oh, well. Sure.	
Message	Kurumi	Well, I'll be on my way.	
Message	Shido	Wha... What was that all about?	
Message	Reine	"Seems as though there is nothing to report."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Hahaha...
