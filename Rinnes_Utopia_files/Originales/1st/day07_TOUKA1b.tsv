Message	Shido	"...Tohka, I'm sorry! It looks like I got a call
from Kotori!"	
Message	Tohka	A call...?	
Message	Shido	I-I'll finish up quickly, so just wait a moment!	
Message	Kotori	"...Hey, what are you dawdling for?!"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Sorry.	
Message	Kotori	"It's an emergency situation. We've found the\nenemy's location."	
Message	Shido	E-Enemy...?	
Message	Kotori	"It seems like the Neo Tengu Tower was the\ncause of the barrier."	
Message	Shido	"...Enemy? Neo Tengu Tower...?
Wait a second! What are you talking about?"	
Message	Kotori	"What? Shido, are you already going senile?\n Is something wrong with you?"	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	Ngh!	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, you okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... Sorry. Something really must have been
wrong with me. Is what you said just now true?"	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. That monument you were talking about...\nAs we guessed, it's one of the footholds of the\nbarrier. The one designed to keep us trapped."	
Message	Shido	Then, that "Guardian" was there to protect it?	
Message	Kotori	"We had trouble analyzing it, but according to the\nresults of the test, the sacred tree and the\ntower at the lake emit the same spiritual wave."	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Kotori	"The barrier was created using these three\nfootholds as an axis, and the center protected\nby this triangle—"	
Message	Kotori	"...is the Neo Tengu Tower."	
Message	Shido	"Th-The Neo Tengu Tower is the barrier's
center, but doesn't that seem strange? It's
the city's biggest landmark, and—"	
Message	Kotori	"Most likely, that's also false. It's something\nthat was made up within this barrier. That thing\ndoesn't exist in the original Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	What?! It's just like you said...	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. Our conscious minds are being\nmanipulated somehow. I was careless, maybe it's\nbecause my spiritual power isn't up to form."	
Message	Shido	Minds being... manipulated...	
Message	Kotori	"You still don't get it? The entirety of Tengu\nCity is within the enemy's control. Our minds,\nmemories, and buildings can all be changed."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, remember. I don't know why, but you're\nthe only one who felt something was off in this\nworld in the beginning. You were right..."	
Message	Shido	"I-It can't be! But how—how could such a
thing—?!"	
Message	Kotori	"In order to figure that out, we'll have to go\ndirectly and ask."	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Kotori	"Tohka's there, right?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, she's here, but...?	
Message	Kotori	"If we're going to step foot into Neo Tengu\nTower, a Spirit's power is absolutely necessary."	
Message	Shido	Th-That may be true, but...	
Message	None	"(We're in the middle of a date right now. Is it
necessary to have to throw it all away to go
right now...?)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido? Right now, the only one who's stable is...\nTohka. We don't know when we're being controlled\neither. Now's the only chance, do you understand?"	
Message	Shido	...I-I understand.	
Message	Kotori	"Please. I'm counting on you.\n ...The Fraxinus will prepare for backup.\n You absolutely shouldn't push yourself."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know!	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what is wrong, Shido? You look depressed.	
Message	Shido	"...Tohka. I'm sorry, but we need to cancel the
date..."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...? Why is that?	
Message	Shido	"You know that there's something strange happening
to Tengu City right now, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes...	
Message	Shido	Yeah. We figured out the cause, so—	
Message	Tohka	Let us go, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Tohka	"Unless we do something, we can't stay this
way, yes?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, that's right.	
Message	Tohka	"Then, I will fight. For myself... and for your
sake, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Thank you, Tohka! Let's do something together,
and surprise Kotori!"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Let's go!	
Message	Shido	"So they're here, huh? The culprit behind
everything..."	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, do you notice the peculiar lack of other
people...?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Even in the middle of the day, it's too
quiet."	
Message	Shido	Hmm, is it Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Shido? This is bad. They may have noticed us.\nThere's not a living being around Neo Tengu\nTower. They may have warded people away."	
Message	Shido	Even then, all we can do is go, right?	
Message	Kotori	"Yes, that's correct. But don't let your guard\ndown."	
Message	Shido	I got it.	
Message	Shido	All right. We're charging in!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, the enemy may have caught onto us.
Even so, are we aiming to head straight through
the front?"	
Message	Shido	"We have no other method, right?
We'll just have to persuade them forward and
openly."	
Message	Tohka	Haha! You really are you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	What does that mean?	
Message	Tohka	Nothing! Now then, let's go!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Shido	You're... from my dream...?	
Message	Tohka	Who... are you...?	
Message	???	No one desires that ending...	
Message	Shido	No one... desires...?	
Message	???	"You should have stayed like this, within the
happy slumber that I have woven..."	
Message	Shido	What are you saying...?	
Message	Tohka	"Is this person... a Spirit...?
Is she really... the same as us?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't know, but this isn't the first time I've
met her."	
Message	None	"(That's right, I've seen her many times in my
dreams.)"	
Message	???	"I am the one who controls this world, who rules
over this paradise. If you were to refer to me by
an identification name, it would be "Ruler.""	
Message	Ruler	"However, there is no use in telling you this,
for I intend to banish you."	
Message	Tohka	Shido, stay back!	
Message	Ruler	"I see... I will teach you. Just how much of
a foolish and fragile being you are."	
Message	Tohka	Urgh! At this rate—!	
Message	Shido	Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	I'll be overcome!	
Message	Ruler	Scatter.	
Message	Tohka	Aaaaaagh!	
Message	Shido	Tohka?! Hey! Listen! Listen to me!	
Message	Ruler	"...Good bye, Shido Itsuka.
I pray that next time, you have a pleasant dream."	
Message	Ruler	"Even though you promised... you said you would
only cherish Tohka..."
