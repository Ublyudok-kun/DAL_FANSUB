Message	Shido	"Huh? Where'd they go? I can't find my chopsticks.
I thought I put them together after I ate with
them."	
Message	Origami	Shido, thank you.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	Your lunch.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, don't worry. Friends always help each other.
Like when you helped me study."	
Message	Origami	I washed these.	
Message	Shido	Oh, are those my chopsticks?	
Message	Origami	Yes.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Thanks, but man, these look practically
brand new. You didn't have to do that."	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. For me, this is a treat.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Origami	Don't worry about it.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	"O-Origami, are you reading a thick reference
book on your lunch break?"	
Message	Origami	Is that a problem?	
Message	Shido	No, i-it's not, but...	
Message	Origami	I just want to use my time wisely.	
Message	None	(R-Right...)	
Message	Shido	"Do you ever read, uh, interesting books or
manga on your days off?"	
Message	Origami	"My days off are often spent observing Shido's
modus operandi, or training."	
Message	Shido	"I see...Wait, what?! Did you just say
you observe me?!"	
Message	Origami	My hobby.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Origami	I visited the Tengu Garrison.	
Message	Shido	?! D-Did they decide your punishment?	
Message	Origami	"I contacted them various times without reply,
so I decided to go there myself."	
Message	Shido	"I thought you weren't allowed to go in and
out freely."	
Message	Origami	Yes. I was reprimanded.	
Message	Shido	I-I bet. Were you okay?	
Message	Origami	Yes, however...	
Message	Shido	However?	
Message	Origami	"As I thought, there were no traces of Spirit
waves on the AST."	
Message	Shido	What?! Oh, I thought so.	
Message	Origami	"You thought so? The observation tool at the
Tengu Garrison is the best in the world. Why
would you think so, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't know much either, but it feels like the
barrier itself is well-hidden."	
Message	Shido	"Because of the barrier, we're completely cut
off from everything outside Tengu City. I heard
it affects the observation tool as well."	
Message	Origami	"Then, how were you able to find out about the
barrier?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? W-Well... haha.	
Message	None	"(I can't tell her that I know someone who's
running the observation tool.)"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"A-Anyways, what's really scary is that no one
even realizes they're trapped."	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Don't you think? We're the only ones who are
even aware of what's going on, right?"	
Message	Origami	...!	
Message	Shido	To top it off, no one can break the barrier.	
Message	Origami	No one can?	
Message	Shido	Yes. We're trying our best.	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Shido	If only we could figure out what they want.	
Message	Origami	Is it an "enemy"?	
Message	Shido	"At the very least, we know they're not our
allies. Especially if they're trapping us
because they're after the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	"Besides, because of this barrier, Tohka and
the girls could more easily go on a rampage."	
Message	Shido	"I mean, Origami, you don't want anyone to
suffer like you have, right?"	
Message	Origami	"If the enemy's goal is to destabilize the
Spirits within the barrier, then I will do all
in my power to prevent that. I will destroy it."	
Message	None	"(Whoa. Origami doesn't change her expression
much, but when it comes to the Spirits, the
anger really comes through.)"	
Message	None	"(Yet another reason I want to make Origami
smile. I hope to make a real, genuine smile
come out of her.)"
