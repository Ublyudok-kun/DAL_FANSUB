Message	Shido	"Go on a date with Spirits and stabilize their power?
Damn it, Kotori. You make it sound so easy."	
Message	Shido	Before I do that, I need to figure out something...	
Message	Shido	"So many things have been happening in the
last couple of days. I need to get it together..."	
Message	Shido	"I wonder if there's somewhere I can go
to gather my thoughts. Oh, what about...?"	
Message	Shido	"Phew... The wind feels so good. The view is great,
this is such a calming place to be."	
Message	Shido	Hm? I thought I was alone...	
Message	Shido	"Oh... you don't need to be afraid. I wanted to be
alone, but if it's just you guys, I can appreciate the
company."	
Message	Shido	I wonder if they'd want any bread.	
Message	Shido	Here you go.	
Message	Shido	"How's that? Sorry they're just scraps.
Do they at least taste good?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, they ate it. Want some more?	
Message	Shido	There, there. Go on, have some more.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Haha, there are more! Wait... isn't this
kind of a bit too much?!"	
Message	Shido	"Y-You guys... come on, give me some personal
space here. Hey?! Hey, get away! Whoa!"	
Message	Shido	T-That was pretty clumsy...	
Message	???	Hehe...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Is... someone there?	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Kurumi	Good afternoon, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Y-You...	
Message	Kurumi	My, you look so terrified.	
Message	Shido	W-What are you doing here?!	
Message	Kurumi	At ease. No need to be so alarmed.	
Message	Shido	"How can I not be?! Don't think I forget what you
did! It was just the other day..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe, really, don't be so worried. I don't plan on doing
anything with you at the moment, Shido-san..."	
Message	Shido	Are you sure?	
Message	Kurumi	Of course. Because―	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, you're empty right now.
You don't look delicious at all."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	I have no plans of eating you today, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"Today, huh? What are you doing at the school?
Besides... don't tell me you plan on coming
back to class..."	
Message	Kurumi	No... There was something that drew my interest.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. That's my business. Don't mind me.	
Message	Kurumi	Anyway, Shido-san... you like pigeons?	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Kurumi	You sure are friendly with them.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, are you being sarcastic?	
Message	Kurumi	"No, you really looked like it.
Anyone would think the same thing."	
Message	Shido	"I wasn't trying to be friendly. They were
poking at me."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. That just means they like you, right?	
Message	Kurumi	"Animals don't lie. They'd never approach
someone they didn't like."	
Message	Shido	"Lying's not the right word. They just
live according to their instincts."	
Message	Kurumi	Is that bad?	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kurumi	"To say you like what you like and hate what you
hate... I think that's a good way to live."	
Message	Shido	I guess when you put it like that, it's alright, but...	
Message	Kurumi	Right? That's what I like about you, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	What?! Y-You know what...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, are you embarrassed?	
Message	Shido	That's not the point. Back on topic...	
Message	Kurumi	Sure.	
Message	Shido	"Living only according to your instincts might make
you cross a line you're not supposed to. That can
be very troubling, right?"	
Message	Kurumi	Are you talking about humans?	
Message	Shido	No, not only that.	
Message	Kurumi	"Humans have already crossed a line they shouldn't have
long ago. Look how they're killing animals to their liking.
And it's not just to survive, but for fun..."	
Message	Shido	W-Well...	
Message	Kurumi	"How are they and humans so different? Humans try
to appear nobly, but animals have lives too."	
Message	Shido	*grunt*...	
Message	None	"(Kurumi is right. Everyone only gets one life and no
single creature has a right to take it away from another.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Wouldn't you say humans are truly selfish?
They always think they're above others."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(There really are humans like that.
That's not all of us though...)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe... I guess there's no point is saying
this to you Shido-san. However..."	
Message	Shido	However... what?	
Message	Kurumi	"Maybe that's more of a reason why someone like
me was born into the world. I'm an archenemy of humans."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(So this is what Kurumi is getting at. Just like humans
are following a natural order in killing animals...
Spirits are killing humans in the same way.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh my. Would you look at the time? I enjoyed this
conversation with you so much that I stayed here
much longer than I should've. I must go now."	
Message	Shido	You really don't plan on doing anything, right?	
Message	Kurumi	"Right. I will be quiet for a little while. Trust me.
Rather, I think you should be focusing on your
own situation, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	W-What?	
Choice		I don't sense animosity. Trust Kurumi.	
Choice		She's gotta be hiding something. Don't trust Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	I guess I'll trust you for now.	
Message	Kurumi	That is lovely.	
Message	Shido	I don't think you would lie, because...	
Message	Kurumi	I'm true to my instincts?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... something like that.	
Message	Kurumi	"Is that so? Hehe. Then, if that's the case,
I should tell you that what I'm most concerned
with is my hunger..."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey...	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm only playing. Calm down, Shido-san.
It's alright though. This is kind of why I like you."	
Message	Shido	Y-You know...	
Message	Shido	How can I trust you? What are you trying to pull?	
Message	Kurumi	My, won't you believe me? How sad.	
Message	Shido	Are you hiding something?	
Message	Kurumi	"I was just looking for something. If you're always
this persistent, you'll never get anywhere with
the ladies, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	"Like that's any of your business! You seriously
won't do something like you did the other day?"	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. I can promise you that much.	
Message	Shido	Fine.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe, Shido-san, it's nice that you're so honest.	
Message	Shido	"Sorry for being so simple-minded.
Please don't betray me."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Now what should I do?	
Message	Shido	W-What?!	
Message	Kurumi	"Well, I'll be off then. Goodbye, Shido-san.
Let's meet again soon."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	What is she thinking? I really can't read her.	
Message	Shido	"If she was vengeful at all, I wish she would just
be upfront about it... I don't like this..."
