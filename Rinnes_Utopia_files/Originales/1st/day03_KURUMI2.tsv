Message	Shido	The Neo Tengu Tower is almost complete.	
Message	Shido	"Man, it sure looks grand. Who would've
ever thought such a nice building would be
built in Tengu City?"	
Message	Shido	"It's so tall that you could spot it anywhere
in town. Truly the icon of Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh...?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...?	
Message	Kurumi	What a pleasant coincidence, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	...You're like a phantom.	
Message	Kurumi	Did you come to look at Neo Tengu Tower?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, kinda. How about you? Did you come
to check out the new hotspot?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes, well... I was rather curious about
something."	
Message	Shido	"Curious...? Wait, don't tell me you're some
kind of industrial spy."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe. Of course not.	
Message	Shido	"R-Right, thought so. I guess you wouldn't
do that."	
Message	Kurumi	Anyways Shido-san, I want to ask you something.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Kurumi	What do you think... about Neo Tengu Tower?	
Message	Shido	"Neo Tengu Tower, huh...? Hm. Everyone's
buzzing in town and at school about how
it's going to be the hottest tourist spot."	
Message	Shido	"Well. I'm sure it'll become the new symbol
of Tengu City, so I don't blame them, but..."	
Message	Kurumi	But... what?	
Message	Shido	Well, um...	
Message	None	"(Why does my heart feel funny? Almost gross.
Like, strangely uncomfortable.)"	
Message	Kurumi	You don't have to panic. I won't rush you.	
Message	Shido	Um...	
Message	None	"(But can I even say it...? It's troubling.
I just don't know how to explain it.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you can't just gift her information."	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	"Kurumi is a wild card. Be careful. She might\npull something in Neo Tengu Tower. If we mess\nup, it might involve people like last time."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	"I'm sure it's no coincidence that Kurumi\nshowed up. There has to be a reason."	
Message	Shido	Then, what do you suggest I do?	
Message	Kotori	"Beats me. Just watch what you say in front\nof her, got it?"	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it.	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	W-Well...	
Choice		I think this will be Tengu City's pride and joy.	
Choice		Something's off.	
Message	Shido	"I really think this'll be the pride and joy of
Tengu City. Having such a symbolic landmark
built... is pretty mesmerizing."	
Message	Kurumi	...I see.	
Message	Shido	Sorry. That wasn't too fun of an answer.	
Message	Kurumi	"No. As a person who lives here, it's only
natural for you to be excited about it."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you for your time. I must be going now.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Good day...	
Message	Shido	What was that all about?	
Message	Kotori	"No clue. Let's just say nothing happened."	
Message	Shido	Sure, I guess...	
Message	Shido	It's hard to explain, but something feels off.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, off you say? What ever could you be
feeling?"	
Message	Shido	"It's hard to explain, but something about
it looks out of place in this town. As if it
doesn't really belong."	
Message	Kurumi	I see. What an intriguing perspective.	
Message	Shido	"I don't know if I'm making sense, but
it came out of nowhere."	
Message	Shido	Maybe I'm just not used to it yet.	
Message	Kurumi	I think that's fine.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, don't forget that feeling.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Kurumi	"Who knows? I pray the answer comes to you
on its own."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	Well, I'll be off now. Good day, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, Shido. What are you doing?"	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry. I just can't shake the feeling that
something's off."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. If that's how you feel, Shido, then\nit must be true, but that's for you to decide."	
Message	Shido	Aw.
