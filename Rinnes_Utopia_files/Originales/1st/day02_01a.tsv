Message	None	Why...?	
Message	None	"All these memories... they're all still here?
That means the reset is becoming incomplete..."	
Message	None	"The powers of Eden are destabilizing...
Why is this happening?"	
Message	None	At this rate, I won't be able offer my protection...	
Message	None	But I can't let that happen... no matter the cost...	
Message	None	(Who are you?)	
Message	None	This... is my wish...	
Message	None	(Huh?)	
Message	None	(Not this dream again...)	
Message	None	Everything is already decided...	
Message	None	Just go with the flow...	
Message	None	(Seriously, who are you?)	
Message	Rinne	Shi...do... get up... Hey... Shido, wake up. It's morning.	
Message	Shido	Hm? R-Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Morning, Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	What's wrong? Are you sick?	
Message	Shido	"I'm okay, just a little groggy. I guess a lot
happened yesterday and I'm just feeling
a little tired."	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah. A lot happened.	
Message	Shido	"You're seriously wondering if I'm sick?
I'm really just recovering..."	
Message	Rinne	You sure looked like you were having fun.	
Message	Shido	"What? Oh... sorry. I guess it's just been
a while since something like that happened."	
Message	Rinne	"Heh. You're right. Don't overdo it, okay?
You should probably take it easy and
just watch the Sports Day activities."	
Message	Shido	Ah. Maybe that's a good call.	
Message	Rinne	Goodness, Shido... oh!	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Rinne	"I thought you'd get up sooner. I forgot
to turn off the fire on the pot. Haha!"	
Message	Shido	Fire safety is no laughing matter!	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry, Shido. I need to go turn it off, but
don't fall back asleep, okay? Get up!"	
Message	Shido	Rinne... Honestly, I'm more worried about you...	
Message	Shido	She can be a little ditzy sometimes...	
Message	Shido	I better hurry up before she starts nagging.	
Message	Rinne	The pot was okay. Did you change y—	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Rinne	Am I... supposed to scream now?	
Message	Shido	"Hold on. Cool it. You don't need to make
fun of me. And you already screamed!"	
Message	Rinne	S-Sorry.	
Message	Tohka	Was that you screaming, Rinne?	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan, did something funny happen?	
Message	Yoshino	S-Shido-san?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun... that's a big yikes."	
Message	Shido	"Hold on. There's a perfectly reasonable
explanatation for this and... wait, are you
all coming in, too?!"	
Message	Rinne	Um... Shido, do you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	W-What is it, Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	"I feel bad, but it won't be good if we can't
keep it underwraps so... sorry?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Ouch...	
Message	Rinne	S-Sorry. I didn't know I was so strong...	
Message	Shido	You don't need to apologize. It's my fault.	
Message	Kotori	"Onii-chan, did you want to show your body
to Rinne?"	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, come on. Can you not treat me like
I'm some hentai gentleman?"	
Message	Kotori	"What? Why not? Hahaha, Onii-chan,
you are the ultimate hentai gentleman!"	
Message	Shido	Don't call me a hentai gentleman!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, you have to admit that much of\nyour life resembles that of a hentai guy."	
Message	Shido	That's not fair!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, really? What do you think, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I... I'm positive Shido-san... isn't!	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, you're the only one who believes in me!	
Message	Yoshino	Of course! Thank you.	
Message	Shido	"All right... Good. Wow, Yoshino really is a good girl,
isn't she, Kotori?"	
Message	Kotori	...YAH!	
Message	Shido	What the?!	
Message	None	(An encyclopedia?! She could've taken my head off!)	
Message	Tohka	"Hey, Kotori. Isn't that a pretty dangerous thing
to throw around like that?"	
Message	Kotori	Haha, yeah, but it's totally fine. It's Onii-chan.	
Message	Rinne	Now, now, Kotori. He hasn't fully recovered yet.	
Message	Kotori	"Okaaay... Sorry, Rinne. It was worth the face
Onii-chan made, though. It was so funny."	
Message	Shido	You know what...?	
Message	Rinne	"Why don't we have breakfast now that we're all here?
Come on, everyone."	
Message	Shido	You're right. The food's gonna get cold soon.	
Message	Tohka	Oh! I thought I smelled something good. What is it?	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, well I thought it might be too early for something
this heavy, but I made your favorite, Tohka... Hamburg!
Just like I promised."	
Message	Rinne	"I'm honestly not too confident that it tastes very good
though. Please, have some before it cools."	
Message	Tohka	"Wow, it's shaped pretty oddly! Whoa, look at all
the juice coming out of it. It looks great!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ah. Rinne, that's amazing! Isn't that right, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	I'm worried that... I may not be able to eat it all.	
Message	Kotori	I'm so excited!	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, eat it before it goes cold, Yoshino. You too,
Kotori. I made you both special plates."	
Message	None	(Rinne's cooking skills are divine!)	
Message	Kotori	Oh! I'm going to eat it while it's still juicy!	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... time to dig in!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. It just makes me happy that you all like it.	
Message	Shido	Rinne, you're so considerate. I really think that's great.	
Message	Rinne	H-Hey, Shido, quit it. You're making me blush!	
Message	Shido	Haha... Sorry.	
Message	None	(But... when did Rinne get so close with everyone? Huh...?)	
Message	Kotori	Hm. What's the matter, Onii-chan?	
Message	Shido	Just... Um, Rinne? Where did you meet Tohka?	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Well... at school I guess?	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... You guess, huh?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, on the day I transferred. Right, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? I think so. Rinne was so kind to me from the
moment we met. She's super nice!"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...	
Message	None	"(I don’t get it. Something feels off. What was Rinne
doing then? I thought it was hard for Tohka to
blend into the class in the beginning...)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, why are you bringing this up? Is everything okay?	
Message	Shido	What about Yoshino?	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Rinne, when did you and Yoshino meet?	
Message	Rinne	Yoshino-chan? Um...	
Message	Yoshino	W-Where... did we meet again?	
Message	Rinne	"I think it was when you moved next to Shido's
apartment, Yoshino-chan. Remember? You dropped
by to say hi."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Oh... Yes! I-I think that's it!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah! That time you made us food because\nyou said it was a housewarming tradition!"	
Message	Shido	Is that so?	
Message	None	"(Yoshino was living in the Spirit house? I don't know
why, but I keep feeling like something happened
to my memory...)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Wow, Shido-kun. Still feeling kinda hazy?"	
Message	Shido	No, no, I'm fine. Sorry if I'm acting weird.	
Message	Rinne	It's okay, but hurry and eat. You'll be late.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	"(I still don't feel at ease about this, but I guess
there's no point in wasting time thinking about
it. I won't get the answers I want right now.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Alright then, I'll be heading out soon. You guys
take care of the rest, okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? You still have some time, don't you?
You barely touched your food."	
Message	Rinne	"Um... I have to get ready for morning practice.
Sorry!"	
Message	Kotori	Okay, Rinne! Have a nice day!	
Message	Rinne	Okaaay. Bye!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Shido, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Rinne was in a hurry... I was wondering if
everything was okay with her."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? I didn't really notice...	
Message	Tohka	"Oh... OH?! Shido, this hamburg steak is
extraordinary!"	
Message	Tohka	"The aftertaste creeps up on you with a total umami
overload! It's so tasty! What do you think, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes! It's very delicious.	
Message	Shido	Haha, I'm sure Rinne would like to have heard that.	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah. As always, Rinne's cooking is the best. Shido,
hurry up and eat! It'll be such a waste if you just
let it get cold."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	(Tohka really likes to eat...)	
Message	Shido	"Oh! I-It's amazing! This is the best hamburg
steak ever!"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! It really is, huh?	
Message	Shido	"The man who marries Rinne will be so lucky.
He'll be eating meals like this every day."	
Message	Tohka	?!	
Message	Tohka	S-Shido? Do you like girls who can cook?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What did you say, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	N-Nothing! I didn't say a thing!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Kotori, make sure to eat, okay?	
Message	Kotori	"You betcha! Ain't nobody gon' leave
a darn thing behind, I tell ya what!"	
Message	Shido	W-What kind of accent are you even trying to do?	
Message	Rinne	Forget it. Hurry up and eat or you'll be late.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Shido	Oh! I-It's amazing! This is the best hamburg ever!	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! It really is, huh?	
Message	Shido	Yeah! Wow, this makes the rice taste so good.	
Message	Rinne	Uh, Shido... You should chew your food.	
Message	Shido	"Oh come on, I know this. Hey, Kotori, you shouldn't
skip out on the rice. Eat that, too. It's great."	
Message	Kotori	"You betcha! Ain't nobody gon' leave
a darn thing behind, I tell ya what!"	
Message	Shido	W-What kind of accent are you even trying to do?	
Message	Rinne	Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, yeah. It's Sports Day, isn't it? I might play it safe
and just watch. Are you gonna go play tennis, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Yep. Are you not feeling okay, Shido?	
Message	Shido	I'm okay, but I just recovered so I'm taking it easy.	
Message	Tohka	Oh, alright. You do what you gotta do, I guess.	
Message	Shido	Rinne, you were going to play... lacrosse?	
Message	Rinne	"Yep, that's right! I'm on the lacrosse team.
I play so much I don't think I can lose!"	
Message	Shido	Alright then, good luck!	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, thanks. As long as everyone's having fun
out there, I'm happy."	
Message	Shido	Haha, such a Rinne answer.	
Message	Rinne	Really? I thought everyone thought that way...	
Message	Shido	"Now, now... anyway, this is a great opportunity
for you. Have fun out there."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah, Rinne! Do your best!	
Message	Rinne	Alright. Thanks, you two. I'll try my hardest.	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Shido	Tohka? Why are you so dazed?	
Message	Tohka	Ah, nothing. Just had something on my mind.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. If you're worried about something, you
know you can talk to me, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah... well, I'm going to school early!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	None	(She seemed a little off...)	
Message	Tamae	Good morning. Time for homeroom.	
Message	Tamae	It's finally time for Sports Day.	
Message	Tamae	"Testing is just around the corner, so make sure
to make the most of this and sweat the stress out."	
Message	Shido	Um... Teacher?	
Message	Tamae	Itsuka-kun? What's up?	
Message	Shido	"Sorry... I'm not feeling too hot.
Do you mind if I sit this one out?"	
Message	Tamae	"Whoa, really? That's unfortunate, but sure.
Go rest up at the infirmary if you need to."	
Message	Shido	"Thanks. I'll just be watching if that's okay.
If I get worse, I'll be sure to go rest."	
Message	Tamae	Sure, just don't overdo it.	
Message	Shido	Thank you.	
Message	Tonomachi	*cough*! *cough* *cough*! T-Teacher!	
Message	Tamae	W-What's the matter, Tonomachi-kun?	
Message	Tonomachi	"M-My chronic tuberculosis seems to have come
out of remission... I'm relapsing! *cough* *cough*!"	
Message	None	"(H-Hey, wise guy. Chronic tuberculosis? Really?
That is one sorry excuse, even for―)"	
Message	Tamae	"O-Oh no! That isn't good at all!
Tonomachi-kun, we need to go to the hospital right away!"	
Message	Tonomachi	W-Whaaaat?!	
Message	Tamae	"Medicine's come a long way. I'm sure we can find a cure!
I know it's an ancient disease, but if you don't deal
with it now, you'll regret it later!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"W-Well... I don't think I'm relapsing anymore...
Yeah, I think it's going away..."	
Message	Tamae	"Tonomachi-kun? You know, tuberculosis is becoming
a lot more common with the younger generations,
what with everyone refusing vaccinations now."	
Message	Tamae	"But don't worry! I'm with you! Let's get to the
hospital and finally get you the help you need!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Tama-chan?! I m-mean, Okamine-sensei...
do you really care about this student so much?!"	
Message	Tamae	Y-Yes?!	
Message	Tonomachi	I think your special care for your students is healing me!	
Message	Tamae	Huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	Look! Wow! It's a miracle! I'm totally healed!	
Message	None	"(Did he hit his head? He must be having mental issues.
To feel fine after a disease like that... it's obvious!)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Look! Thanks to you, I have courage again!
Yah! Yah! Yah!"	
Message	Tamae	B-But...	
Message	Tonomachi	I'm okay. I promise I'll visit the hospital later.	
Message	Tonomachi	"It's all thanks to you that my condition has healed.
If it's okay with you though, I'd like to play it safe
today and just be an observer."	
Message	Tamae	O-Okay... sure. Just make sure to get a check-up soon.	
Message	Tonomachi	Okay, okay!	
Message	Tamae	"Okay, everyone, we decided on which sports
we'll be playing, so make sure to check what
you're supposed to be playing today."	
Message	None	(That actually worked? Oh, Tama-chan...)	
Message	None	(Tonomachi just forced her to believe him. I feel awful.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, Itsuka! Did you see the magic old Tonomachi
just performed?! I won't let you be the only one
to play hooky today."	
Message	Shido	"Some nerve. Don't think we're doing the same thing
here. Besides, if it was anyone else besides Tama-chan,
you would've never been able to pull that off."	
Message	Tonomachi	"What's your problem, Itsuka? Are you jealous
of my sweet, sweet skills?"	
Message	Shido	"You really should think about going to the hospital.
You probably should get your head checked out."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, come on. Don't do me like that. Here, I'll let
you even use my excuse next time you're trying
to get out of doing something. It's on the house!"	
Message	Shido	"Why are you like this? Who on earth would feel
comfortable using an excuse like that?!"	
Message	Tohka	"HEYYY! *cough* *cough*! *groan*! *cough* *cough*
I said *couuugh* and *wheeze*!"	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Tamae	Y-Yatogami-san?! W-What is it?!	
Message	Tohka	"O-Oh no! Tonomachi... I must have caught his terrible
tuberculosis disease! Can I sit out, too? I don't feel well."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Tohka! You should play!	
Message	Tohka	Grr! But I want to watch with you, Shido!	
Message	Shido	!	
Message	Tamae	"Uh... Y-Yatogami-san? Are you really okay?
I mean, with all the coughing and everything..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Y-Yeah! Huh?!	
Message	Tohka	C-*cough* *cough*! *cough* *cough*! How's that?	
Message	Tamae	Oh. This isn't good at all.	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, you were fine this morning.	
Message	Tohka	Well, um... *cough*	
Message	Rinne	Don't play dumb.	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, don't put the teacher through all this.
You said you were looking forward to tennis too,
since it was your first time and all..."	
Message	Tohka	Well... that's true, but...	
Message	Tonomachi	Hm? What's the matter, Tohka-chan?	
Message	Tohka	Why can't I be the one sitting with Shido?!	
Message	Tonomachi	AH!	
Message	Origami	I am not happy with what I just heard.	
Message	Tohka	Origami Tobiichi?!	
Message	Origami	"A person who cannot even fulfill a task they were
given has no right to spend time with Shido."	
Message	Tohka	W-What are you talking about?	
Message	Origami	"Only winners can spend time with Shido.
It's Sports Day, after all."	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Rinne	Oh... I get it. That sounds fun!	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Origami	"If you choose to forego this challenge, then the one
who will be spending time with Shido is... me."	
Message	Tohka	"What?! Okay then... I will attempt this... tennis...
and try my very best to win."	
Message	Origami	"No need to try your best.
We know who will be victorious in the end."	
Message	Tohka	"Shut up! Just shut up! I'm gonna participate
in Sports Day, do my best, and be the winner!"	
Message	Origami	As you wish. I won't lose.	
Message	Tohka	Grrr... I won't be the one to lose...	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Seems like we managed to get through this.	
Message	Shido	"Easy for you to say, isn't it? And when did I become
the prize? Nobody even asked me how I felt about that!"	
Message	Rinne	It's for Tohka-chan. Give it up.	
Message	Shido	Fine...	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, just try your best at tennis, okay? I'm not sure
if I'll make it in time, but I'll try to see your match!"	
Message	Tohka	Right! Wait, really?	
Message	Shido	Yes, really.	
Message	Tohka	I'll be waiting for you!	
Message	Shido	"I'm not sure I'll make it to yours either, Origami,
but good luck with volleyball! Make our class proud,
okay?"	
Message	Origami	Anything you want, Shido.	
Message	Shido	And thanks for stopping Tohka...	
Message	Origami	"No need for that. If we let her get in the way of
homeroom any longer, it will affect today's progress."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	None	(Anyways, I'm glad Tohka didn't go rogue...)	
Message	Shido	*sigh*...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Feeling tired after being fought over by all of these
cute girls, Mr. Nice Guy? Give me a break!"	
Message	Shido	"The only reason any of this happened is because
you pretended to have tuberculosis today!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"You're right. To think Tohka-chan would use the ol'
Tonomachi Magic... I've gotta say, I'm impressed."	
Message	Shido	Can you please stop being a bad influence on Tohka?	
Message	None	(I'm seriously gonna kick your ass if you keep it up.)	
Message	Tamae	Uh... Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?!	
Message	Tamae	"So... you and Tonomachi-kun will be the ones
sitting out, right?"	
Message	Tonomachi	Yes! That's right. Thank you!	
Message	None	"(Your magic totally wore off and you're acting
way too healthy for someone who just had TB.)"	
Message	Tamae	O-Okay. Um... you two were on the soccer team, right?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes...	
Message	Tamae	"I'll contact the sports committee and get replacements
for you. Please adjust the team rosters with the
new members."	
Message	Shido	I-I'm so sorry for all of this.	
Message	Tamae	"It's totally fine. You two just focus on your health.
If you feel better, just make sure to cheer everyone on."	
Message	Tonomachi	Okay! Leave it to me!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Tamae	Class 2-4! Let's do our best and get this victory!	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! Leave it to me!	
Message	None	(Phew, Tohka finally is pumped.)	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Tohka-chan we can't lose now can we?	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah, but I'm not losing to you either, Rinne!
I'm giving it my all, so you better be, too!"	
Message	Rinne	U-Um... I'll do my best!	
Message	Tohka	Okay!	
Message	None	"(Rinne's playing lacrosse... Origami, volleyball...
Tohka's in tennis... hm. I hope I'll be able to see
everyone play, but that might be a challenge.)"	
Message	Rinne	"What?! Um... I'll try my best. I mean, I am on the
lacrosse team as it is... and that's the sport I'm
playing today..."	
Message	Tohka	Gotcha.	
Message	None	"(Oh, right. Rinne was in lacrosse, wasn't she?
I want to go cheer for everyone, but I don't think
I'll be able to go to every match.)"	
Message	Tohka	So, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Huh? What is it?	
Message	Tohka	What do I do... in this tennis thing...?	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Tonomachi	Alright, Itsuka! Let's go feast our eyes on paradise!	
Message	Shido	"No, no. We need to head to the soccer field
because there are people who have to suffer
on account of us sitting out."	
Message	Tonomachi	"You kidding me, bro? What about the girls?!
We gotta get a good look at them!"	
Message	Shido	"No, we really don't. All we need to do
is make sure we cheer them on."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, don't be such a dweeb, Itsuka.
Okay, who do you want to go watch?"	
Message	None	"(*sigh* He's always like this.
Anyway, who should I go cheer for?)"	
Choice		Cheer for Tohka	
Choice		Cheer for Origami	
Choice		Cheer for Rinne
