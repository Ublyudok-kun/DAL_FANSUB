I'll head out into the hallway..."	
Message	Shido	...Hello? Did something happen?	
Message	Reine	"I just received a call from the Fraxinus...\nYoshino has disappeared from the house."	
Message	Shido	Disappeared...? Maybe she went for a walk?	
Message	Reine	"Unfortunately the situation is\nnot quite so casual."

Message	Shido	"I understand. I'll search on my end!
I swear I'll find Yoshino!"
