Message	Shido	"Hm. I wanted to go on a date with Kotori, but
I think she might be on the Fraxinus."	
Message	Shido	Oh well. I guess I'll hit the market.	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Instead of thinking about who to date,
here I am at the station..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, well. I've got to get groceries anyway.	
Message	Shido	"Now, that should cover everything for dinner.
Hm, is that...?"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Shido?	
Message	Shido	What are you doing here?	
Message	Kotori	I... was looking up at the sky.	
Message	Shido	The sky?	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. Staring as the clouds go by. It puts my
mind at ease."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Seems like... being Ratatoskr's commander
is tough work."	
Message	Kotori	Yes, but I can't run away from it.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Reine	"Shin, are you with Kotori?"	
Message	Shido	Reine-san? Yes, I'm with her now.	
Message	Reine	"Oh, I see. Glad to hear it. There's an error in\nthe system, and I can't seem to spot her."	
Message	Shido	She seems... stressed out.	
Message	Reine	"Hm. I knew it. She's becoming emotionally\nunstable."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Despite her wearing her black ribbons,
she's awfully quiet."	
Message	Reine	"Shin... Cheer up Kotori."	
Message	Shido	What, me?	
Message	Reine	"There's a lot on her shoulders. It's important\nto show appreciation when you can."	
Message	Reine	"We're trying our best to care for her, but what\neases her mind most are your words, Shin."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but... I don't know what to say.	
Message	Reine	"It's all right. Don't think too hard about it.\nJust be yourself."	
Message	Shido	Okay. I'll try my best.	
Message	Reine	"Yes. That's the spirit."	
Message	Shido	U-Uh...	
Choice		Be positive.	
Choice		Care for her.	
Message	Shido	Um. That's not like you, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Are you feeling sentimental because you're
tired? Knowing your usual self, you usually
play it off like it's nothing, right?"	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What...?	
Message	Shido	"It's fine. Kotori, you're doing a great job. Even
now, I know you'll make it through. When it's
all over, you'll be able to relax."	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. Got me there, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Kotori	"You don't need to tell me that! Don't worry
about me. I'll be my usual self in no time!"	
Message	Shido	Hahaha! Exactly. That's the Kotori I know.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, geez... Well.	
Message	Kotori	I'm going to return to the Fraxinus!	
Message	Reine	"Amazing, Shin. Kotori already sounds better."	
Message	Shido	I hope so. I just don't want her to overdo it.	
Message	Shido	Kotori, hang in there.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, don't push yourself too hard. Things
won't end well if you pass out, so get some
rest."	
Message	Kotori	"If I could rest, then I would have done so!
I'm sighing because I can't."	
Message	Shido	...Oh, okay.	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez. You're always meddling with my
business."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry.	
Message	Kotori	I'm going home.	
Message	Shido	I wonder if I screwed up.	
Message	Reine	"Shin, women are complex creatures."	
Message	Shido	Well, uh... *sigh*.
