Message	Shido	"It gets so cold in the evenings around this
time of year. I feel my body getting cold."	
Message	Shido	Maybe I'll take a bath.	
Message	Shido	Oh? Someone left the light on?	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	Shi...do?	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...? What are you...?	
Message	Kotori	What? Why are you in a daze?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Uh... u-uh... I was just wondering if we
ran out of shampoo or not..."	
Message	Kotori	You idiot! You idiot brother!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry! It wasn't on purpose!	
Message	Kotori	You ready?	
Message	Shido	W-Wait. Can we talk about...	
Message	Kotori	Ugh. You're hopeless.	
Message	Shido	"I-I said I'm sorry. We used to bathe together
back in the day. What's the big deal?"	
Message	Kotori	Did you say something?	
Message	Shido	Nothing, nothing at all!	
Message	Kotori	Goodness...	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"Things are getting complicated already.
Can you not give me more things to stress about?
It seems like Reine-san isn't doing great either."	
Message	Shido	Is... Reine-san okay?	
Message	Kotori	"Huh? Oh yeah. But Reine is always feeling sick, right?
It's not like this started yesterday."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, we are kind of working her
to the ground due to the late incidents."	
Message	Shido	I-I see... I'm worried about Reine-san.	
Message	Kotori	Are you trying to change the subject?	
Message	Shido	N-No. That's not it. I'm just worried about Reine-san..	
Message	Shido	"And what do you mean complicated?
What's going on? Did you figure something out?"	
Message	Kotori	"Nothing. We were able to observe the Spirit reaction
throughout Tengu City, but... that's all we know."	
Message	Shido	Is there no way to look into it further?	
Message	Kotori	"We could've if it was possible, but we can't
get a hold of headquarters so there's nothing
we can really do."	
Message	Kotori	"We're in the middle of a big phenomenon though.
And I think Tengu City is in the center of this big
change. That's all I can say for sure."	
Message	Shido	I see.	
Message	Kotori	Don't give me that look.	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, your job is to go on dates with Spirits and
stabilize them. If a girl dates a guy with the face
you're wearing, they'll only feel worse."	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I looked that glum, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah, and it worries me. Shido, you need
to act normal or the Spirits won't feel at ease."	
Message	Shido	Okay...
