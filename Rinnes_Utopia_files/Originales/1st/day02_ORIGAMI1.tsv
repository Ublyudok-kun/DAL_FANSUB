Message	Shido	Where did Origami go?	
Message	None	"(I was going to ask her on a date, but
before I knew it, she was out of the classroom.)"	
Message	Shido	Um... Origami? Heh, what am I doing? She's not here.	
Message	???	What?	
Message	Shido	AHHH! O-Origami?!	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"D-Don't scare me like that. I thought I was going
to have a heart attack."	
Message	Origami	"That would have been okay. I could've given
you CPR."	
Message	None	(T-That's not the issue here...)	
Message	Origami	Do you want to practice?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	CPR.	
Message	Shido	"Uh... w-well, I-I'll save the fun for when
my heart actually stops..."	
Message	None	(What am I even saying?!)	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	Were you looking for me?	
Message	Shido	"Well... um... yeah... yes.
I wanted to talk to you again."	
Message	Origami	I wanted to do it, too.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	With you.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, yeah. Well, let's talk...	
Message	Origami	No.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Something that feels way better than that.	
Message	Shido	!	
Message	Origami	Wanna do it?	
Message	Shido	"N-No! W-W-Well... um...
I don't think this is the right place for..."	
Message	Origami	So, you're saying if it's not here... then we can?	
Message	Shido	"Um, uh, w-well... oh, I know!
What are you doing after this?"	
Message	Origami	Cleaning up. From Sports Day.	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	(Crap. I didn't even have anything planned.)	
Message	None	"(What do I do? I thought I would've just been
able to sit down and talk with Origami...)"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh, it's Kotori. Sorry, Origami, I need to take this.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"So? Are you on a date?"	
Message	Shido	Uh... I was about to... attempt one I guess?	
Message	Kotori	"You sound unsure. Stop. Who's the target?"	
Message	Shido	Origami.	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. I see. That's why the Spirits' romance\nlevel hasn't changed, huh?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, I mean, just like last time, Origami
might attack you again. I thought that might not
be good, so I..."	
Message	Kotori	"I know. I didn't say it was a bad thing, did I? Go on,\nbe friendly with her. As long as she's in a good mood,\nI'm sure something good will come out of it."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	"So, what's it like?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I wanted to invite her out, but you know how
it was Sports Day? She's cleaning up now..."	
Message	Shido	"I was just a spectator today so I don't think they
assigned me any cleaning tasks."	
Message	Kotori	"Seems like you have two options here."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Clean up with her... or play hooky together."	
Message	Shido	I see. I don't know about that second one.	
Message	Kotori	"I'm not recommending it. Origami isn't a Spirit,\nand she's hard to read. I'm not sure which option\nwould make her happier."	
Message	Shido	S-So... what should I do?	
Message	Kotori	"It's your choice to make, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"What?! You're gonna give me all that and then
not even recommend me an option?!"	
Message	Kotori	"Were you not listening to what I was saying?\nShe's not a spirit, but she definitely has feelings\nfor you. Come on, I'm at my limit here."	
Message	Shido	I see. You're right.	
Message	Kotori	"You decided to make her your date target, right?\nUse that dumb brain of yours for once and think\nabout what would make her happy."	
Message	Shido	It's way easier for you to say that, but...	
Message	Kotori	"I'm busy. I'm going now. You just make\nsure that woman doesn't attack me."	
Message	Shido	Hey! Hey, Kotori! Ugh!	
Message	Origami	Shido? What happened?	
Message	Shido	Oh! Um, nothing! It's fine. No problem here.	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	Uh... Origami? I know what we can do.	
Message	Origami	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Do you...	
Choice		Want me to help you clean up?	
Choice		Wanna play hookie?	
Message	Shido	C-Can I help you clean?	
Message	Origami	Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. As long as it's not too much trouble for you.	
Message	Origami	"I lost the game. I don't have the right to be
with you right now, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, um... I'm not a prize. And I want to be with
you right now, Origami, so... what do you say?"	
Message	Origami	Okay.	
Message	Shido	Let's clean up together!	
Message	Origami	Mmm...	
Message	Shido	So, what should I help with first?	
Message	Origami	Use this. Rake the ground over there.	
Message	Shido	Ah, the rake, huh? Got it!	
Message	None	"(Origami gave me the T-shaped rake. It's also called
a tombo I think... They use it to flatten soccer and
baseball fields.)"	
Message	Shido	Seriously, you all did great today.	
Message	Origami	It doesn't matter. It's pointless if you lose.	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Some people might think of it that way, but there
are definitely things to be learned in the process.
Results aren't everything."	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I mean, it's a competition and the point is to
win. But still..."	
Message	Shido	"Just because you lost doesn't make your efforts
pointless. That's what I think, anyway."	
Message	Shido	"It makes me feel sad to think that the results are
the only thing that matters in something like this."	
Message	Origami	I understand what you mean. It's so like you.	
Message	Shido	"Y-You think so? Kotori would just call me naïve
for saying something like this. She'd probably
just laugh at me."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Oh... sorry.	
Message	Origami	It's okay. You two are close siblings.	
Message	Shido	!	
Message	Origami	"And.... so long as it wasn't Efreet who killed my
parents."	
Message	Shido	W-Well, we haven't figured that out yet.	
Message	Origami	I'm done on my end. Thanks for helping me, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Sure...	
Message	Origami	I'm going to go return this equipment.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami...	
Message	None	(Crap, I thought things were going well, too...)	
Message	Origami	If you say so, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Are you sure?	
Message	Origami	Whatever you tell me is my top priority, Shido.	
Message	Shido	I see. Then... let's go!	
Message	Origami	This way.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Come.	
Message	Shido	W-Wait a minute! Where are we going?	
Message	Origami	The AV room or the mechanical rooms are empty.	
Message	Shido	Huh? W-Wait, what are we going to do there?	
Message	Origami	CPR practice.	
Message	Shido	W-We don't have to practice that!	
Message	Origami	Huh? You want to do something more... intense?	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh... um... today, um... I...
I remembered I had to do something! Bye, Origami!"	
Message	Origami	Oh...
