Message	Tohka	Shido!	
Message	Shido	Whoa! T-Tohka?! What's up all of a sudden?	
Message	Tohka	"C-Could you let me help with what you call
"dish-washing"?!"	
Message	Shido	H-Huh? But your specialty is eating...	
Message	Tohka	"T-Today is different!
Th-This is a woman's castle, so to speak!
It is important to keep the castle clean!"	
Message	None	"(I don't really know what she means, but I do
know that I will probably not win this one.)"	
Message	None	(I suppose it's not too big of a deal...)	
Message	Shido	"A-All right, Tohka. Then for today, you can wash
them, Rinne can dry them, and I can put them back
in the cabinet. Is that okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Leave it to me!	
Message	Rinne	Let's do our best, Tohka-chan.	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Let us work together, Rinne!	
Message	Tohka	By the way Shido, what exactly is "dish-washing"―	
Message	Shido	"It's fine, say no more. Rinne, I'm sorry, but
could you please teach Tohka how to do it?
Which soap and sponge to use...?"	
Message	Rinne	Of course. Leave it to me!	
Message	Tohka	Hm, thank you for your help.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe, you're welcome.	
Message	Rinne	That's right, Tohka-chan. Just like that.	
Message	Tohka	H-Hmm. I-Is this all right?	
Message	Tohka	Hm?! I-I'm sorry!	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's fine. I'll clean it up.	
Message	Tohka	"My hands were slippery because of the bubbles...
I apologize."	
Message	Shido	It happens to everyone, so don't worry.	
Message	Rinne	"It really does happen quite a bit. If you scrub
the dishes too hard, you'll end up breaking
them... I've shattered a few, too."	
Message	Tohka	"You too, Rinne?! I can't believe it... But I
understand! I just have to not put in so much
strength! All right―"	
Message	Tohka	―Gah!	
Message	Rinne	D-Don't worry! Are you hurt?	
Message	Tohka	I-I'm fine, but the dish...	
Message	Shido	Y-You don't have to move, Tohka! I'll clean it up.	
Message	Tohka	I-I apologize...	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, anyone would be like this their first
time. There are some dishes that are really
fragile, too."	
Message	Tohka	R-Right... Maybe I can do the bowls correctly.	
Message	Tohka	Oof...!	
Message	Rinne	T-Tohka-chan...	
Message	Shido	"I-I know! Even if you drop chopsticks they won't
break, so we can have you wash the chopsticks―"	
Message	Tohka	"I-It's fine... It seems I don't have enough
strength right now... I apologize, Shido,
Rinne... I'll be right back..."	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?	
Message	Rinne	T-Tohka-chan... Is she okay?	
Message	Shido	"She looked pretty down in the dumps... Well,
I'm sure she'll recover by tomorrow. I think..."	
Message	Rinne	"I'm not here tomorrow, Shido... So, could you
make sure to support Tohka-chan and the others?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's right... Um, yeah, I'll be fine!
I can't keep relying on you, so I'll just
do my best!"	
Message	Rinne	Goodness... I'm worried...	
Message	Shido	Hey now, am I that unreliable?	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, I don't mean it like that, but you were
unconscious until just a little while ago..."	
Message	Shido	I'm pretty much recovered now. I'm fine!	
Message	Rinne	"If you insist, I'll leave it to you...
But if it seems like too much, tell me, okay?"	
Message	Shido	"All right, I'll do my best for it
not to get to that point."	
Message	Rinne	Well, then I'll be heading home now.	
Message	Shido	"All right, be careful on your way back...
Well, you're next door, so I guess it's fine."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, you don't have to worry.	
Message	Shido	Thanks for everything, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"See you tomorrow, Shido.
I hope you wake up to a happy morning!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Happy and noisy.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Good night.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, good night!	
Message	Shido	"Now then... I really have to do
my best tomorrow..."
