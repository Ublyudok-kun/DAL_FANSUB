You...unning out of...ime..."	
Message	Shido	Mm... Mmmm.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... You awake?	
Message	Shido	Mm, Rinne... Morning.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... Morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm? You seem down.	
Message	Rinne	"Not at all! You're one to talk, Shido.
You were groaning in your sleep.
How are you feeling? Can you get up?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, I'm totally fine! I'll get up now.	
Message	Rinne	"Good. I've made breakfast, so come down
after you change, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Nothing. Just thinking about how
amazing you are..."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... You finally up?	
Message	Shido	Mm, oh... Rinne. Morning...	
Message	Rinne	Good morning, Shido. Another beautiful day.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Seems like it.	
Message	Rinne	"You were tossing and turning all night.
You okay? Think you can get up?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm fine... I'll get up.	
Message	Rinne	"Good. I've made breakfast, so come down
after you get changed, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Rinne... You're really one-in-a-million.	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. Thanks. Be careful, though. Someone
might think you're trying to flirt with me."	
Message	Shido	"No, I'm serious. I wish that... I could be
like you."	
Message	Rinne	I'm flattered, but the praise is undeserved.	
Message	Rinne	"Besides, you shouldn't want to be anyone
else. Just focus on being yourself."	
Message	Shido	Mm, but I'm as average as can be...	
Message	Rinne	"Not at all. I can think of plenty likeable
things about you."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	"?! Oh, um... I was just talking to myself...
Nothing to see here."	
Message	Shido	Uh... Okay?	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	...Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"H-Hey, if we talk too much, you'll be late.
Shido, hurry up and get ready!"	
Message	Rinne	"?! Oh, um... I was just talking to myself...
Yeah."	
Message	Shido	Uh... Okay?	
Message	Rinne	"H-Hey, if we talk too much, you'll be late.
Shido, hurry up and get ready!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh yeah, huh? Guess I'll get dressed
right away then."	
Message	Rinne	"Aah! Hey Shido! Don't start stripping down!
I'm still here!"	
Message	Shido	Oh... R-Right. Sorry Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	"I-It's okay. Just make it quick, okay? I'll go
on ahead!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rinne!	
Message	Shido	"...Rinne sure is acting weird.
Or am I imagining things?"	
Message	None	"(Crap, I did it again...
I guess old habits die hard.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, anyways... I'd better hurry up and get
dressed.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shidoooo! How much longer do you plan on
sleeping?!"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Oh!! Shido! Are you already awake?!	
Message	Tohka	Grr...	
Message	Shido	Why do you look so upset?	
Message	Tohka	"It came to my attention that you enjoy
being dropkicked awake!"	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	None	(Kotori, what have you been telling her?!)	
Message	Tohka	Grr... Seems as though I was too late...	
Message	Shido	No, Tohka. You heard wrong.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? How do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"Uh, you see... It's because I prefer to be woken
up gently."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. Understood. Then I'll be sure to do so
next time."	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san... Good morning!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey hey, Shido! You're up!"	
Message	Shido	Oh. It's Yoshino and Yoshinon. Mornin'.	
Message	Yoshino	Y... Yes!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Heeeeey. Real sorry to see that happened to\nyou, Shido. If you slept for just a bit longer,\nYoshino might've been the one to wake you."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	"R-Right. At least I'll have that to look forward
to next time."	
Message	Tohka	Mm...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's up, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Shido... I want you to tell me something.	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Tohka	"What exactly is a "dropkick"?
How does dropping come into play?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Tohka... What were you planning to do if I
had still been asleep...?"	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Well, you see, there's the dilemma.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Tohka	"Well, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to suck
on a gumdrop while kicking you, or if I was
supposed to shove one in your mouth first."	
Message	Shido	Uh... Well... Hm...	
Message	Tohka	"If you're so hesitant to answer... Is it because
a real dropkick is far more dangerous?!"	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not like that. Uh, how do I put this?
I think it's a different kind of danger than
the one you're thinking of, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...? What do you mean?	
Message	Tohka	"*gasp*! Don't tell me they poisoned
the gumdrop?!"	
Message	Shido	"No... It's not like that either! Simply put, a
dropkick is a two-footed kick delivered in
mid-air."	
Message	Tohka	Hm... Is that so?	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Tohka	"I see. It makes sense that one would be easily
awoken from that!"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, that wasn't an invitation
to do it, though!"	
Message	Tohka	H-Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Anyway, Tohka and Yoshino...
I'm going to get dressed, so would you two mind
going on ahead?"	
Message	Tohka	Be quick about it, okay? Breakfast is prepared.	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	Uh... Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes?!	
Message	Shido	Would you mind joining her downstairs?	
Message	Yoshino	...Okay.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Gosh, Shido. You're so shy."	
Message	Shido	"Finally, they're gone... When everyone's here,
the mornings are pure chaos."	
Message	None	"(But there's some comfort to be found in
this kind of chaos, I suppose.)"	
Message	None	"(Neatly laid out on the dining table was the
breakfast Rinne had prepared.)"	
Message	None	"(White rice, miso soup with tofu and green
onion, fried fish, and an omelette. She even
had natto, seaweed, and pickles as sides...)"	
Message	None	"(All the makings of a traditional Japanese
breakfast. I could never whip up a meal this
elaborate by myself.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Seems like everyone's seated. Now, let's
dig in!"	
Message	Tohka	Okay! I shall dive right in!	
Message	Tohka	Delicious! Today's breakfast is exquisite!	
Message	Tohka	"Mmm! This omelette... So fluffy on the outside.
Yet, the warm broth flows out once you take a
bite!"	
Message	Tohka	"Add in some of the rice, and... *nom*...
Mmm. You've outdone yourself this time!"	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... Oh, Tohka-chan. You won't get anything
from flattering me."	
Message	Tohka	"R-Rinne... Does that mean seconds are out of
the question?"	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Seconds...	
Message	Shido	"You said, "You won't get anything."
That's what Tohka's worried about."	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, I see what you mean. No need to worry,
Tohka-chan. I've prepared seconds. Just make
sure to chew before you swallow, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Okay! Another helping, please!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka... You know...	
Message	Rinne	Ahahahaha...	
Message	Yoshino	Um. Thank you... for the meal!	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Yoshino-chan, eat up, okay?	
Message	Yoshino	Okay!	
Message	Rinne	"Oh. You aren't good with hot food, right?
I tried cooling the miso soup beforehand.
Is it all right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank... you...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Boy, Rinne. You're so thoughtful. You'd make\nthe ideal wife!"	
Message	Shido	"You can say that again. Who knows where I'd
be without her housework."	
Message	Tohka	"Indeed, and she sure knows her way around the
kitchen."	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh... What's with all the compliments today,
you two...? You're going to make me blush..."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm. Onii-chan has been hitting on Rinne
since this morning! Rinne's not gonna like that!"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, it's not like that, Kotori! I'm flattered.
Not upset."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ahahaha! Rinne, you're adorable. Looks like\nyou'll be Yoshino's biggest rival!"	
Message	Yoshino	...Yoshinon?!	
Message	Shido	Rival? Are you two gearing up for battle?	
Message	Yoshinon	"*Sigh*... What am I to do with you, Shido?\nGoodness. I fear what's to come..."	
Message	Kotori	Hahaha! That's just Onii-chan being Onii-chan.	
Message	None	"(I may not know what's going on, but I can tell
when I'm being mocked. Wear that ribbon all
you want, little sister. You're still evil...)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey Kotori, you'd better not be a bad influence
on Tohka."	
Message	Kotori	What do you mean, "bad influence"?	
Message	Shido	"If I get dropkicked while I'm sleeping, then
there'll be hell to pay."	
Message	Kotori	Whaaaaat? You could totally handle it.	
Message	Shido	Jeez...	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Shido, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Nothing! Don't mind us, Tohka. Just enjoy
your breakfast."	
Message	Tohka	Hm, if you say so.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Rinne. Your miso soup is just delightful!	
Message	Rinne	Really? I'm so happy you like it.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, Onii-chan! If you don't want your omelette,
then could I have it?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, sure... It's all yours, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Ohhhh. Thank you, Onii-chan! I love you!	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, but then that wouldn't be enough food for
you, Shido. You can have one of mine."	
Message	Shido	But then you'll be hungry, won't you, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	It's fine. I want you to have mine.	
Message	Shido	B-But...	
Message	Rinne	Here you go, Shido. Say, "Aah."	
Message	Shido	Ahhh...	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Thanks.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? No fair, Rinne! I want to feed Shido, too!	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... I'd like to... feed him, as well...	
Message	Kotori	Oh? Then let me have a go, too!	
Message	Yoshinon	"You're amazing, Shido."	
Message	Rinne	"H... Hey guys? What do we do, Shido? I...
I might have made a mistake."	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, we can all take turns next time, okay?
If everyone gets a turn, I'll be late!"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh... I can't risk being tardy, so we will have
to table it for next time. Promise!"	
Message	Kotori	Same here!	
Message	Yoshino	M-Me too...	
Message	Shido	Okay. If—and only IF—the time comes...	
Message	None	"(Thank God... Seems like those girls really
went for it...)"	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, next time, how about being mindful of
where you're looking next...? It's so obvious
you were trying to play it off."	
Message	Shido	Grr... I'll be careful.	
Message	Rinne	Good.	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha... Come to think of it, I haven't checked
the weather yet today."	
Message	Rinne	Gosh, Shido... Fine.	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"You're welcome. Stop blabbering, and make
sure to eat, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, yeah. I know.	
Message	Newscaster	"—An owner of the zoo in Tengu City..."	
Message	None	Hm...?	
Message	None	"(My ears couldn't help from perking up,
as I'd recognized the name of the city on
the news.)"	
Message	Newscaster	"...Three days have passed since the 56-year-old\nman was first reported as missing."	
Message	Shido	Ah... Looks like they haven't found him yet.	
Message	Rinne	"Without the owner, who knows how bananas
the zoo must be..."	
Message	Newscaster	"It is believed that foul play could be\ninvolved, and so the authorities are continuing\ntheir investigations..."	
Message	None	"(Apart from the spacequakes, I figured this
town was pretty peaceful, but lately, it seems
like we've gotten nothing but depressing news.)"	
Message	Newscaster	"Onto our next story, multiple reports of\nmissing pets have been popping up\nthroughout Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	"Man, first a missing zookeeper, and now pets?
What's going on?"	
Message	Kotori	"Aah. Don't tell me they're being abducted
by aliens or something..."	
Message	Shido	I'm sure that's not the case.	
Message	Rinne	"Weird... Maybe it's like the Pied Piper of
Hamelin?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't know. It could be an omen...
Sure seems like one."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh! The curtain for battle will soon rise...
It's the fate of the world!"	
Message	Tohka	Battle?! Is there an enemy coming, Kotori?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Tohka's said it, so it's bound to happen!\nYippie!"	
Message	Shido	Don't say stuff like that!	
Message	Rinne	Tohka, it's a joke. Calm down, okay...?	
Message	Tohka	Oh... It was a joke?	
Message	Shido	"Well, at least we won't have to worry about
being attacked... I think."	
Message	Tohka	Hm... Got it! Rinne, seconds please!	
Message	Rinne	"Suuuuure. Tohka, you eat so much that I never
hesitate about making big portions."	
Message	Tohka	"Your cooking is just too good, Rinne.
I can't help myself."	
Message	Rinne	Teehee... Tohka, you're not so bad yourself.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? But I didn't cook...	
Message	Rinne	"No, that's not what I meant... Never mind.
Forget it... Tohka, do you want a large helping?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! PLEAS—	
Message	Shido	Tohka?!	
Message	Rinne	Tohka?!	
Message	None	(Is she having a spiritual rampage?!)	
Message	Tohka	I... I'm fine!	
Message	Kotori	"MMM! Are you all right? Did you choke on
your food?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah. Sorry for worrying you, Kotori. I'm fine.	
Message	Kotori	Mm. Goodie. Right, Onii-chan?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(I think it was Kotori's way of telling me to
keep my cool. Rinne doesn't know Tohka's a
Spirit, and if we overreact, her cover's blown.)"	
Message	Shido	I was just caught off-guard, is all...	
Message	Yoshino	M-Me too...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Tohka-chan, you okay? Even Yoshinon was\nstartled by that."	
Message	Rinne	"You sure you're all right? Did you cut your
hand or anything?"	
Message	Tohka	Well, I'm fine, but...	
Message	Shido	What's the matter, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Sorry, Shido... I broke the bowl!	
Message	Rinne	"What are you talking about? Who cares about
the bowl? Your well-being is more important.
I'm just glad you weren't hurt."	
Message	Tohka	"B-But Rinne! Th... This bowl... Shido bought
it for me! I promised him I'd take good care
of it..."	
Message	Rinne	"S-Sorry... I didn't mean it like that...
What do we do? What can we do?"	
Message	Shido	"It's fine, Tohka. We can buy another one
together."	
Message	Tohka	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	Of course. Anyways, how are you feeling?	
Message	Tohka	Like I said earlier, I feel totally fine.	
Message	Rinne	...Shido, you're so great.	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What makes you say that?	
Message	Rinne	No reason. That's just so like you.	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Tohka	All right, moving on... Rinne, seconds please!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?!	
Message	None	"(Held in Tohka's right hand was a brand new
bowl, raised high for seconds. After everything
that happened, Tohka still wants to eat?!)"	
Message	Yoshino	T-Tohka-san... D-Don't push yourself!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Why would you say that?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Now now, Tohka-chan. Take it easy, and\nmaybe go for a smaller portion, okay?"	
Message	Rinne	"Yoshino-chan has a point. If you overeat
and become sick, that wouldn't be good."	
Message	Shido	She's right... Tohka, maybe hold off on seconds?	
Message	Tohka	GRRRRRRR!	
Message	Rinne	"Tohka, I'll prepare your favorite dish tomorrow.
How about that?"	
Message	Tohka	Really?! What are you going to make for me?!	
Message	Rinne	"It's a secret, but I guarantee you that it'll be
extra delicious, so get ready."	
Message	Tohka	OHHH! You promise, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Yup! Promise!	
Message	Tohka	Okay! Then, I'll be a good girl today!	
Message	Yoshino	Tohka-san... You're always a good girl!	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	Rinne	"With that said, everyone's finished eating
so why don't we start clearing the table?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, let me help.	
Message	Rinne	Don't worry. Leave it to me.	
Message	Shido	"That's no fair. It'll be faster if we all do it
together."	
Message	Tohka	Allow me to help, too!	
Message	Rinne	"Thanks, Shido and Tohka-chan, but I'm more
than willing to handle it myself."	
Message	Shido	"I don't mind at all! Let's all clean up and
head for school!"	
Message	Rinne	"Okay. Thank you. Tohka-chan, just don't
push yourself too much, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, of course! Leave the rest to me.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe...	
Message	Kotori	Mmm... Rinne-oneechan? Are you sure you're okay?	
Message	Rinne	"Yes. I always do this.
In fact, I'm in my element."	
Message	Kotori	"No, I was talking about clearing the table...
Don't you need to leave soon? Won't you
be late for practice?"	
Message	Rinne	Huh?! WHAAAAAT?! Is it already that time?!	
Message	Shido	Practice...? What are you talking about?	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, Onii-chan. Rinne-oneechan is one of the
star players on the lacrosse team! Did you
forget again?"	
Message	Shido	Oh... Really?	
Message	None	"(I dug into the deep recesses of my mind for
any kind of confirmation... Oh, yeah. I guess I
somewhat recall Rinne heading out early...)"	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry, Shido! I feel terrible because I was the
one who insisted upon clearing the table, but
could I leave the rest to you?"	
Message	Shido	"Yup! You can count on me. Besides, it's my job.
Rinne, you really do spoil us."	
Message	Rinne	"Like I said, I enjoy doing it,
but thanks anyway."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, don't worry about it. Get going.	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, just make sure not to push yourself!	
Message	Tohka	Noted. Don't worry!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Okay, see you later!	
Message	Shido	All right. Later.	
Message	Rinne	Okay.	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! Hurry up! Rinne has been waiting
outside for you!"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Come on, get a move on!	
Message	Shido	Okay! I'll be right out.	
Message	Kotori	Shido, wait a minute.	
Message	Shido	"Hm? What is it, Koto—wait, when'd you put that
ribbon on?"	
Message	Kotori	"Forget the ribbon. I wanted to tell you
something."	
Message	None	Huh? What do you want to tell me?	
Message	Tohka	Shido, hurryyyyy!	
Message	Shido	"Actually, Tohka, go outside without me and
wait with Rinne. I'll be right out."	
Message	Shido	"Actually, Tohka, go on ahead and wait outside.
I'll be right out."	
Message	Tohka	"Grr... Fine. Just make sure not to take too
long, understood?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, got it.	
Message	Shido	So, what's up?	
Message	Kotori	Shido... You know what you have to do, right?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but... Wait. Don't tell me a new Spirit's
emerged."	
Message	Kotori	No.	
Message	Shido	Then, what do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	You saw how Tohka was earlier, didn't you?	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"She's appeared fine for a while, but I'm
starting to see signs of instability. Not just
Tohka, either. Even Yoshino or I might go rogue."	
Message	Kotori	"I know it's you... but you know what you have
to do, right?"	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	"There's no other way. Ratatoskr is going through
some issues, so there's no way to manage the
Spirits. Ratatoskr's an island in the sky, now."	
Message	Shido	What's going on over there?	
Message	Kotori	"We're currently looking into it. As long as
we've got the Fraxinus, we can manage, but I
need your cooperation to stabilize the Spirits."	
Message	Kotori	"Didn't I tell you? The Spirits seem the most
stable when they're with you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	Kotori	"Especially when they're on a date. The results
are remarkable. That's why, Shido, I need you
to go on more dates."	
Message	Shido	"I know that, but why does it feel like I'm
getting déjà vu..."	
Message	Kotori	"Hello, are you really concerned about that?
As we speak, Tohka and Yoshino could explode
at any minute. So, it's your job to save 'em."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. We all have to do our part.
If there's anything I can do, then you bet
I'll do it."	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. That's the spirit! I'll leave them to you,
but..."	
Message	Kotori	"Be extra careful this time. You're not
invincible. If you make any mistakes,
you're dead. Be mindful of that."	
Message	Shido	"Even so... I'm the only one who can save you,
Tohka, and Yoshino, right? Guess I have no
choice."	
Message	Kotori	Well... It's for your benefit, too.	
Message	Shido	How so...?	
Message	Kotori	"Stabilizing Spirits helps prevent your body
from going rogue as well, Shido. This is our
best method of limiting that chance."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	"But... Listen carefully. Next time you're in a
situation where you feel out of your depth,
don't think twice. Just run for it."	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	Kotori	"You promised, remember? That you wouldn't
overdo it."	
Message	Shido	Right... I'll do my best.	
Message	Kotori	"Good. Now, if you keep those girls waiting
any longer, I'm sure Tohka will be concerned.
Go ahead."	
Message	Shido	"Got it. Kotori, try not to overdo it too,
okay?"	
Message	Kotori	"Who do you think you're talking to?
Unlike my stupid brother, I'm aware
of my own limits, so don't worry."	
Message	Shido	Urgh... Oh.	
Message	Kotori	Good. Anyways, take this.	
Message	Shido	...Keys?	
Message	Kotori	"I've given a set to Tohka as well, so please
give the other one to Rinne."	
Message	Shido	Okay, sure. What do they unlock, though?	
Message	Kotori	"They're for our house. Duh. I changed all of
the locks yesterday for added security."	
Message	Shido	...But why?	
Message	Kotori	"Man, use your brain. They might be Spirits, but
it's still a bunch of girls living in a house
together. Anything could happen."	
Message	Kotori	"Consider the fact that the patriarch of
the house is a useless wimp whose only
redeeming quality is his harmlessness..."	
Message	Shido	"Only redeeming quality is his harmlessness"...\nHey, are you talking about me?!	
Message	Kotori	Who else???	
Message	Shido	"Gah... Huh? Wait... These keys look awfully
cutesy."	
Message	Kotori	"It's intentional. It's harder to lose track of
them that way, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Guess you have a point there. They're not
really my style though, are they?"	
Message	Kotori	"Quit complaining. I had Ratatoskr make them,
so they're practically indestructible."	
Message	Shido	Wow... Okay, got it.	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways, if we keep Tohka waiting, you'll
be in big trouble. Get going. Now, let the
dates commence!"	
Message	Kotori	Okay, Shido. Let's begin our (war) date.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, here he is!	
Message	Tohka	GEEZ! You're so late, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Tohka and Rinne! Let's hurry, or we'll
be late!"	
Message	Shido	Sorry! Let's hurry, or we'll be late!	
Message	Tohka	Shido... What did you discuss with Kotori?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh... Nothing important.	
Message	Tohka	Oh. My interest is piqued.	
Message	Shido	"Well, there's nothing to be interested in. It
has nothing to do with you, Tohka."	
Message	None	"(Not like I could tell her that she's unstable
to her face.)"	
Message	Tohka	You sure? You'd better not be lying to me.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Trust me, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	Very well! If you say so, I'll trust you.	
Message	None	(Why am I feeling sentimental all of a sudden?)	
Message	None	"(It's not just for Tohka's sake—it's for mine,
too. Don't worry, Tohka. I promise to save
all of you.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Come on, you two! Get a move on. We're
going to be so late!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, wait a second, Rinne. Let me give this
to you."	
Message	Rinne	Huh? A key? What for?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. We decided to change the locks at home.
Don't you want to enter the house on your own?"	
Message	Rinne	What? Is it okay for me to have this, though?	
Message	Shido	"Haha. What do you mean? You're like family,
Rinne. If you have a spare key, then you can
come in whenever you like, right?"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh... Right. Yes. You have a point.
Thank you, Shido. I'll take good care of it."	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Shido	"Tohka, make sure to hold onto yours too,
okay?"	
Message	Tohka	"HEY! I'm well-aware! I'll take care of mine
as well!"	
Message	Shido	I see. All right, then! Let's be on our way!	
Message	Tohka	Right!	
Message	Rinne	Okay!	
Message	None	"(As I sped down the street towards my school,
Tohka and Rinne followed me from behind.)"	
Message	None	"(Not even five minutes had passed, and my shirt
was stuck to my back from sweat. Cicadas buzzed
all around me as if to confirm the summer heat.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido... I'm feeling hot!	
Message	Shido	"Don't say that; it'll make it even hotter.
Welcome to summer in Japan."	
Message	Tohka	Summer in Japan?	
Message	Rinne	"That's right, Tohka. This is Japan's hottest
season."	
Message	Shido	Actually, it'll get even hotter than this.	
Message	Tohka	"Aw... Could it really get much hotter?
That sounds awful."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's only June, so I'm afraid of what's
to come."	
Message	None	"(As I sped down the street towards my school,
Tohka was right behind me.)"	
Message	None	"(Not even five minutes had passed, and my shirt
was stuck to my back from sweat. Cicadas buzzed
all around me as if to confirm the summer heat.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido... I'm feeling hot!	
Message	Shido	"Don't say that; it'll make it even hotter.
Welcome to summer in Japan."	
Message	Tohka	Summer in Japan?	
Message	Shido	"That's right. It's this country's hottest
season. Well, at least the start of it.
It'll only get hotter from here."	
Message	Tohka	"Aw... Could it really get much hotter?
That sounds awful."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's only June, so I'm afraid of what's
to come."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Is that true?!	
Message	Rinne	Did you find something?	
Message	Shido	"Tohka! Rinne! Wait up for me, you guys!
I'll be right back!"	
Message	Tohka	HEY! Where do you think you're going?! SHIDO!	
Message	Rinne	What?! Shido, what's gotten over you?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Is something wrong, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Tohka! Wait right here! I'll be back!	
Message	Tohka	HEY! Where are you going?! SHIDO!	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant* *pant, pant*!	
Message	None	"(That's weird... I know I saw her...
But she's gone...)"	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, are you looking for something, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Aaaah!	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Sorry, did I scare you?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! I knew it was you...	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, did you recognize me? What an honor
to have Shido-san recognize me."	
Message	Shido	Urgh!	
Message	Kurumi	"I apologize, though. Today, there's someone
else I'm looking for."	
Message	Shido	Who are you looking for?	
Message	Kurumi	Phew...	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Did you think it was you? Well, I
suppose I wouldn't mind looking for you."	
Message	Shido	"I was just—! But you're... looking for someone
besides me."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. As much as I wish to continue speaking
with you, Shido-san, I must excuse myself."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Tohka	HEY! Shido!	
Message	Kurumi	Very well then, Shido-san. Until next time...	
Message	Shido	Hey! Waaaait!	
Message	Tohka	What happened, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh... Nothing...	
Message	None	"(Should I tell Tohka that I bumped into Kurumi?
No, that'd just stress her out unnecessarily...
She didn't seem like she wanted to hurt me.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? You okay, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah! See, I used to have this childhood cat,
but it got out and never came back. I thought
it was my cat, so I decided to run after it."	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really? How did that go?	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Tohka	"What? You said you ran after the cat, right?
Were you able to catch it?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well... Uh... Yeah, I did! But...
It wasn't the same cat."	
Message	Tohka	It wasn't? Oh. How unfortunate.	
Message	Tohka	"However, the cat may return to you someday.
Don't let it get you down too much, okay, Shido?"	
Message	None	"(Ugh... Maybe I shouldn't have lied.
Now I feel sorta guilty...)"	
Message	Rinne	Hey, you guys! Don't leave me behind!	
Message	Shido	Oh? Rinne!	
Message	Tohka	Oh, that's right!	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh. The heck was that about... Even Tohka ran
off."	
Message	Tohka	Sorry, Rinne...	
Message	Shido	"I'm sorry, Rinne! I saw a cat... Enough about
that! This is no time to be side-tracked, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Huh?! What's the matter?!	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Well... This time... It's time.	
Message	Shido	"If you don't want to be late, stop asking
questions! Let's sprint to school!"	
Message	Tohka	WHAT?!	
Message	Rinne	Okaaaay. I'll do my best.	
Message	Shido	Okay, right.	
Message	Tohka	Huh? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"If you don't want to be late, stop asking
questions! Let's sprint to school!"	
Message	Tohka	WHAT?! That's right! Let's go, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Right!
