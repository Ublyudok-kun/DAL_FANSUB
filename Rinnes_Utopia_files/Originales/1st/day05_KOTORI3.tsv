Message	None	"(Kotori works day in and day out without a
break as commander of the Fraxinus. It's such

Message	None	(Kotori, what can I do for you? Hm...?)	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	"What are you doing here...? You must be exhausted.
Shouldn't you be resting at home?"	
Message	Kotori	"I-I just wanted to organize my thoughts, so
I came outside. I'm fine... Totally fine."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but...	
Message	Kotori	"I said I'm fine! There's nothing for you to
worry about. I..."	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori...	
Choice		Isn't there something I can help you with?	
Choice		I know it's tough, but hang in there.	
Choice		You seem busy.	
Message	Shido	"Isn't there something I could help you with?
If I can do anything to alleviate your stress,
I..."	
Message	Kotori	No. Not a single thing.	
Message	Shido	"What? Come on. I'm sure there's something
I can do."	
Message	Kotori	Nope.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...	
Message	Kotori	I'm the only who's able to do what I can do.	
Message	Kotori	"It's not something I can defer to someone,
even you."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, there is something you should be able
to do. That is your role."	
Message	Shido	...Right.	
Message	Kotori	But...	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Kotori	Could you give me the energy to keep going?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sure. As much as energy as you want.	
Message	Kotori	I knew you'd say that.	
Message	Kotori	"So for now, just a little, could you lend me
a shoulder to lean on?"	
Message	Shido	Kotori, I'll be right by your side.	
Message	Kotori	Mm...	
Message	Shido	"This is all I've got for now, but hang in there.
I know it's tough."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, I didn't need you to tell me that.	
Message	Shido	Oh. R-Right, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"I'll do it. My duty, that is. For myself, and for
everyone."	
Message	Shido	Okay, that's the Kotori I know.	
Message	Kotori	And for you too, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kotori	Shido, you're always you.	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Nothing. Now, let's go home. We can't be here
all day."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Shido	You seem busy.	
Message	Kotori	Yup.	
Message	Shido	"I'll do the best I can with what I've got to do,
so hang in there too, okay?"	
Message	Kotori	Okay, I'll do that.	
Message	Shido	"For now, I guess I have to decide whom to ask
on a date."	
Message	Kotori	What do you mean by that?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Isn't that my job? You told me yourself.
In order to stabilize the Spirits, I need to date
everyone..."	
Message	Kotori	"I KNOW THAT! But... do you have to say it in
front of me?! That's what I'm asking!"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are you mad about?!	
Message	Kotori	...You really don't know?	
Message	Shido	"I don't get it! I'm doing exactly what you've
told me to do!"	
Message	Kotori	"Y-You're right, huh? Haha... Hahaha... It was
just me. I was the only one... who felt that way.
To think that... you and I were... connected."	
Message	Shido	...Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Was I imagining things? Were you nicer to me
than usual because you were trying to kiss up?
This... This is so... cruel!"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, Kotori! What's the matter?! Why are
you acting so weird?!"	
Message	Kotori	Don't come near me! I... I...!	
Message	Shido	Wait! Wait...?! Kotori! Kotoriiiiii?!	
Message	Newscaster	"Vast wildfires are erupting throughout Tengu City,
but the cause is still unknown. Neither the fire
department nor the police can stop the flames."	
Message	None	"(Was what I said to Kotori wrong? She was
stable up until now, but she's suddenly gone
rogue.)"	
Message	None	"(The entire town was burned to the ground, and
its original splendor was lost.)"	
Message	None	"(Eventually, the spacequake engulfed all
of Tengu City.)"	
Message	Shido	"Kotori insists that she's fine, but she must
be stressed to the bone right now."	
Message	Shido	I should cheer her up more.	
Message	Shido	"Of course, I should date her too. I'm going to
take her out to help her relax."	
Message	Shido	"Not just to prevent her from going rogue. I also
want to be there for Kotori as much as I can."	
Message	Shido	So, Kotori, let's go on a date tomorrow!	
Message	Shido	...Go ahead?	
Message	Rinne	Sorry, I'm not Kotori-chan.	
Message	Shido	"...Rinne? Oh, it's fine, but... what's the
matter?"	
Message	Rinne	I wanted to ask you something, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Ask me something?	
Message	Rinne	"Yes, that's right. Shido... you've made up your
mind, huh?"	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Rinne	You said... you wanted to support Kotori-chan.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I... don't want to see Kotori suffer the
way she has. I want to see her smile."	
Message	Rinne	I see. So that's what you've decided, huh?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. That's what I've decided.	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido. Promise me something.	
Message	Shido	Promise...? What for?	
Message	Rinne	"That you'll take good care of Kotori from now
on. No matter what happens, you won't let her
go. Promise me."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's gotten into you? You don't need
to tell me that..."	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise. Promise me
that you will think only of Kotori-chan, or
else your heart will drift away some day."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Please...	
Message	Shido	"Okay, I promise. Man's word. I promise... to take
good care of Kotori."	
Message	Rinne	"Okay, I knew you'd make that promise with
me."	
Message	Shido	Haha, seriously? What's gotten into you?	
Message	Rinne	"I have faith in you. I trust you, Shido. Don't
forget your promise. Don't break it either, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Rinne	If you break it, then you must pay.	
Message	Shido	I-I know.	
Message	Rinne	I see. As long as you understand.	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's the big deal? Why are you threatening
me?"	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	But...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	"You'll be fine, right? I'm sure if it's Shido,
he'll be fine."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What was that just now?!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne... Did you just see―	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Rinne's gone?
When did she...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is pretty late...
I should head to bed as well."	
Message	???	"...In this dream... no one can become happy...
Shido Itsuka... I hope your next dream will be
a happy one..."
