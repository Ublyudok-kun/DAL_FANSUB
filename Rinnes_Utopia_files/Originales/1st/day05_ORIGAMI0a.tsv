Message	Shido	Zzz...	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Mm...mmm...	
Message	Kotori	Shido, wake up.	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Huh? Kotori...? Why are you waking me
up so early?"	
Message	Kotori	"I need to tell you something, so let's talk
before breakfast."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Got it. Give me a moment.	
Message	Shido	"So what is it? Is it... about the monument?
Or about the thing that attacked me?"	
Message	Kotori	Both.	
Message	Shido	Both?	
Message	Kotori	"When you and Origami approached the monument
is when that entity appeared, right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Kotori	"Then, I think it's reasonable to assume they're
related."	
Message	Shido	S-Sure, that's true. So, what was that thing?	
Message	Kotori	"We don't have enough information to say for
sure. But based on what you describe, it has
to be a Spirit."	
Message	Shido	It was a Spirit?	
Message	Kotori	Well, not exactly, but pretty close.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that?	
Message	Kotori	"It gives off similar readings to a Spirit, but
judging from its movements, it's separate from
the Spirits like Tohka, who act with free will."	
Message	Shido	You think so...?	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, even though your brain is smaller than
a Megaphragma mymaripenne, as a normal
person, I'm sure you can imagine it."	
Message	Shido	Wh...What is this insect?	
Message	Kotori	"Whatever. Forget it. All I know for sure is that
it was created by Spirit powers."	
Message	Kotori	"If you were to describe it with video game
terms, it would be like a ""Golem"" or a
""Guardian"". Think like that."	
Message	Shido	That's so unrealistic.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, don't you realize that you have no
room to judge until you know what it is
you're facing?"	
Message	Shido	Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"If you're to be believed, then I assume this
""Golem"" is guarding something."	
Message	Shido	G-Guarding?	
Message	Kotori	"In other words, it means someone is going
to great lengths to protect that monument."	
Message	Shido	I see... But you don't know for certain, yet.	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. That's the extent of what we know.
At the very least, it is related somehow to
the barrier."	
Message	Kotori	"I tried analyzing the Spirit waves surrounding
the monument around the time you told me you
were there."	
Message	Shido	Well, did you catch anything?	
Message	Kotori	"The pattern of the Spirit waves near the monument
correspond with the barrier covering Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	"The waves move at different speeds, so I nearly
missed it. But if you align them, they match."	
Message	Shido	Which means...?	
Message	Kotori	"The barrier and monument are linked somehow.
Most likely, the barrier, the monument, and this
Guardian all come from the same place."	
Message	Kotori	"That's the most logical conclusion. The monument
has to support the barrier."	
Message	Shido	"It's being supported by the monument? So if
we destroy it..."	
Message	Kotori	"If it works that way, I would have done so
already. Unfortunately, it's not that easy..."	
Message	Shido	Wait, are you saying... There's more than one?	
Message	Kotori	Sharp. Next you'll tell me pigs are flying.	
Message	Shido	SHUT UP!	
Message	Kotori	"Listen. There has to be something like the
monument somewhere in Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	"We just need to figure out what it is, right?
We're only getting started."	
Message	Kotori	"Yup, we've got a long way to go. But Shido,
it's our job to figure it out. You need to
prioritize your dates."	
Message	Shido	B...But at this rateâ€”	
Message	Kotori	"Of course, if you notice anything, then tell
me. But nothing more than that, got it?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	"If our analysis yields results and we determine
the enemy's base, it'd be simple, but..."	
Message	Shido	"The enemy...? Like that Guardian thing from
before?"	
Message	Kotori	"I'm talking about whoever created it. The one
who's got us locked in this barrier."	
Message	Shido	You think the barrier is a trap of some kind?	
Message	Kotori	"Hm? Oh, you're talking about theory. It's true,
we're still learning what the motive for creating
the barrier was, but..."	
Message	Kotori	Whatever it is, we're still trapped inside of it.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Kotori	"Whether it's to kill or protect someone, or to
lock the Spirits in, whoever's responsible does
not want the barrier broken. That's for sure."	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"Anyone who tries touching the barrier will be
hurt. You figured that out when you checked
out the monument, didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, I did...	
Message	Kotori	"What I don't get is how I detected two of those
Spirit wave patterns when I scanned the monument."	
Message	Shido	Two?! What does that mean?!	
Message	Kotori	There may be more than one barrier...	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kotori	"If I were scanning one wave at a time, I wouldn't
have noticed. But if you layer the waves together,
one plays in reverse, same frequency."	
Message	Shido	Plays in reverse...	
Message	Kotori	"My first thought is that it's an error, but Reine
brought this to my attention, so it has to real."	
Message	Shido	Oh, um, sorry... Can you explain it again for me?	
Message	Kotori	"No need! Enough chit-chat! Just focus on
what needs to be done!"	
Message	Shido	"Whaaat? Well, okay. Sorry. I'll do whatever
I can. We need to figure this out as soon as
possible. I'm sure it's tough on everyone."	
Message	Kotori	"Just a reminder. You're not invincible. So
please, don't overdo it."	
Message	Shido	Okay, I promise.	
Message	Kotori	"Seriously... I'm getting even less sleep than
Reine because I'm worried sick."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	N-Nothing!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay!
