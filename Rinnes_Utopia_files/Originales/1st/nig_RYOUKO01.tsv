Message	Shido	"Hey... I've seen this machine before...
Wait, is this Origami's?!"	
Message	Kusakabe	"Origami?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, uh... N-Nothing!	
Message	Kusakabe	"Hm? Who... are you?"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... My name is Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Shido Itsuka... Oh, wait. Gosh... That girl, how\ndare she forget her device at her boyfriend's..."	
Message	Shido	"What?! W-Wait, I'm not her boyfriend! Besides, it
just happened to be on the floor... This is some
kind of device for the Ground Self-Defense Force, right?"	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh... So you know that Origami is in the\nGround Self-Defense Force, do you?"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Kusakabe	"Well, it's fine that you know. So long as she's\nokay with it. I'm... Ryouko Kusakabe. I'm\nSergeant Origami Tobiichi's superior officer."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I feel like I've heard of you before...	
Message	Kusakabe	"Well, don't worry about it."	
Message	Shido	...Have you gotten any word from Origami?	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh, a lot happened... I wanted to talk to her,\nbut..."	
Message	Shido	Understood. I'll take this to her.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh thank you, I'd appreciate that, Itsuka-kun."	
Message	Shido	No problem...	
Message	Kusakabe	"...I know I shouldn't be saying this, but please\ncontinue to be friends with Origami. I know she's\nunfriendly and stubborn, but she's a kind girl."	
Message	Shido	Yes. I am aware of that.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Hehe. Thank you. Oh... Also, please don't tell\nOrigami that you spoke with me."	
Message	Shido	Huh... Oh... Okay. G-Got it.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Well, I'll be off now. Goodbye."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Is that... the AST?	
Message	Kusakabe	Hm? Who is it?!	
Message	Shido	I-I was just passing by!	
Message	Kusakabe	"Oh, I see... I'm sorry. I heard they found
something dangerous around here, so
this place is off-limits."	
Message	Shido	Dangerous...?	
Message	Kusakabe	"Uh... Y-Yes... It's just a little while, so do you
think you can hold on a moment?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, um, don't worry! I'll be going home!	
Message	Shido	Damn it, Origami, she's forgetting again...	
Message	Kusakabe	"...Origami, can you hear me?"	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry, you've got the wrong person!	
Message	Kusakabe	"Hm...? Oh, you must be Itsuka-kun. Origami hasn't\nbeen calling at all lately... How is she at\nschool?"	
Message	Shido	"Well... She's the same as usual. Meaning to say
she's doing well."	
Message	Kusakabe	"I see... That's a relief."	
Message	Kusakabe	"You see, her bickering partner is currently\nhospitalized. Origami seemed to be a little\nbummed."	
Message	Shido	I see... I hope her partner gets out soon.	
Message	Kusakabe	"Mm, thank you... Oops, sorry I took your time.\nI'll call Origami again later."
