Message	Shido	*yawn*...	
Message	Kotori	"What's your problem? You look like
an idiotic mouth-breather."	
Message	Shido	Oh. I think I've just been feeling sleepy...	
Message	Kotori	"If you're sleepy, then go home and rest.
You've got another long day tomorrow."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... You're right.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(I'm alone in this room with Kotori...
What if she gets cuddly with me like
she did this afternoon?)"	
Message	Kotori	What...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Nothing. I was just wondering if you
were too tuckered out."	
Message	Kotori	Not really...	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	"...Was everything that happened earlier a fabric
of my imagination?"	
Message	Kotori	...Of course not.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	"...You think you know someone, until they're
acting like an idiot in your living room."	
Message	Shido	...Are you embarrassed?	
Message	Kotori	"It's not that. I feel like you should be taking
your responsibility more seriously, don't you
think?"	
Message	Shido	Responsibility...	
Message	Kotori	"We're in a position where our responsibility
matters, so we can't dilly dally forever."	
Message	Kotori	"As such... We need to clearly distinguish when
we're on a date, and when we are not. That is
the scope of our responsibility."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	So, because of that...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	...Brace yourself for our next date.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...
