Message	Shido	...So this is the shrine?	
Message	Shido	"I know it's late, so should I have been more
careful? Kotori told me..."	
Message	Shido	"For some reason though, I felt compelled to
come here on my own. I wonder why. It's
not like I'm lacking in suspicion."	
Message	Shido	I wonder where Kurumi is.	
Message	???	Shido-san...?	
Message	Kurumi	So, you've come.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	"That's unfortunate. Had you not arrived,
I would have given up."	
Message	Shido	Hm? What do you mean?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, nothing. Don't mind me.	
Message	Kurumi	"Anyway, were you planning to invite me
on a date today?"	
Message	Shido	Yes, I planned on it.	
Message	Kurumi	"Then, why don't we spend some time
wandering around this shrine today?"	
Message	Shido	Here...?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. It is a quaint, peaceful place.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, sure. I'm sure going somewhere else
would only eat up more time. Let's hang out."	
Message	Kurumi	Besides, we'll be alone here.	
Message	Shido	...What?	
Message	Kurumi	Tee hee... Nothing.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, don't tell me this is where you sleep.	
Message	Kurumi	That's... a secret.	
Message	Shido	A secret?	
Message	Kurumi	Girls who keep secrets are more alluring.	
Message	Kurumi	Wouldn't you agree, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Y-You think so?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes.	
Message	Shido	Well, you are like a phantom, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Is that what you would call a compliment?	
Message	Shido	I'd be happy if someone told me that.	
Message	Kurumi	Happy...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. However wary I may be of you, I find
it fun to talk and spend time with you."	
Message	Kurumi	...I see.	
Message	Shido	How about you, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Tee hee... That's also a secret.	
Message	Shido	Sounds like secret is your favorite word.	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, I agree.	
Message	Kurumi	Anyway, tell me about yourself, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	About myself?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. The home you grew up in, your childhood,
or the school you attend."	
Message	Shido	It's not very interesting, though.	
Message	Kurumi	"No, don't fret. I want to hear more about you,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Okay, if you say so.	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you.	
Message	Shido	Well, why don't I start with my school?	
Message	Kurumi	Sure. I can't wait.	
Message	Shido	Oh, look at the time.	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, the sun is starting to set.	
Message	Shido	I should head home, or it'll be late.	
Message	Kurumi	You're going home already?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I gotta make dinner.	
Message	Kurumi	I'd love to try your cooking, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"Then, would you like to visit sometime for
dinner?"	
Message	Kurumi	"No doubt my presence would be cause for
controversy. Is that okay with you?"	
Message	Shido	Urgh... That wouldn't be ideal.	
Message	Kurumi	"How unfortunate. Oh! Then why don't we have
lunch here?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, good idea. We could do that. Okay, I'll
prepare us lunch for tomorrow."	
Message	Kurumi	...Really?	
Message	Shido	Of course. I'm going to head out now, okay?	
Message	Kurumi	Okay. I shall wait here for you tomorrow.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, Shido-san. Watch your step.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Whoa!!	
Message	Shido	Oh, s-sorry...	
Message	Kurumi	It's fine. I'm glad you didn't trip.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	...Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh... Sorry.	
Message	Shido	U-Um...	
Message	Kurumi	I'm terribly sorry.	
Message	Shido	Well, this time, for real...	
Message	Kurumi	U-Um!	
Message	Kurumi	"Do you think you could spend just a little
more time with me?"	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	"I wanted to tell you... more about myself,
Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Really?	
Message	Kurumi	So, I would hate to part ways so soon.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Please.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	So, I wish to tell you what my purpose is.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kurumi	What...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... I see. That's what you wanted to talk
about. Hahaha."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, you are awfully forward.	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about? I don't even
know what's going on."	
Message	Shido	A-Ahem. So, your purpose...	
Message	Kurumi	Well...	
Message	???	"My, this is harder than I anticipated. Opening
up, I mean."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	...!	
Message	Kurumi?	"Like last time, this proves to be more your
forte, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	Th-There are... two Kurumis?!	
Message	Kurumi?	"Hehe, hehehehe. Surprised, Shido-san?
Now you see I'm not alone."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Shido	"That's right. You have the ability to clone
yourself. So, this Kurumi is a...?"	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Terrible, Shido-san! You hadn't forgotten, but
you never tried to remember. Maybe that was
your intention?"	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Hahahahaha. How did your dreams taste?
Having them scrambled like that."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about...?	
Message	Main Kurumi	Hee hee. I'll show you everything!	
Message	Shido	What in the world?!	
Message	Kurumi	...?!	
Message	Shido	What's happening here?!	
Message	Kurumi	Can't you see?!	
Message	Shido	I-Is this... another Tengu Tower?!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?!	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Kihihihi! You must protect him, or Shido-san
will dieeeee!"	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Kurumi	I won't... let it happen!	
Message	Shido	K...Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	Please run away! I can't hold on much longer!	
Message	Shido	What's going to happen to you?!	
Message	Kurumi	"I assume, I will disappear. My life will be
forfeited if I betray myself."	
Message	Kurumi	But... I can't let any harm come to you!	
Message	Shido	There's no way. I can't leave you behind here!	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Main Kurumi	I tire of this drama. Come on, hurry up.	
Message	Kurumi	Aah... Rngh!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, forgive me. I didn't think it through.	
Message	Main Kurumi	Oh, my. Don't tell me...	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Kiihiihi. You're totally falling for Shido-san's
spell, aren't you? Hee hee, hehehehe. Just
watching you is vexing. Now, begone already."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kurumi? You've protected me so many
times in the past."	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... I still am.	
Message	Shido	"I want to protect you, too. With something
greater than power... With heart."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	I won't let you be erased! I'll protect you!	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Hehe. Hehehe... I want to hurl! Shido-san...
You want to die that badly? You'd risk your
life for a clone?"	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Now that you're empty, Shido-san, you are not
worth eating, so I'll exterminate you here.
Hihi. Kihihihi!"	
Message	Kurumi	I won't let that happen!	
Message	Main Kurumi	Get out of my way!	
Message	Kurumi	*cough*!	
Message	Main Kurumi	"A person who has lost her sense of purpose...
is worthless."	
Message	Kurumi	Aah!	
Message	Main Kurumi	Kihihihi! Completely useless!	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	(Why isn't it working?!)	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Besides, all of the energy I expended
to make you has been spent, eh?"	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Not like you've consumed anyone to make
up for that time. Time to cut my losses."	
Message	Kurumi	...?!	
Message	Shido	"Wait, does that mean Kurumi hasn't attacked
anyone?!"	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Yes, that seems to be the case. She needs to
let go of this charade. That's why you're so
weak!"	
Message	Shido	But in the alley...	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, I was feeding a cat. I didn't think... that
was much like me."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	None	"(Did Kurumi listen to me? Is that why she can't
use her powers... Damn it!)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...! You...	
Message	None	"(I see. That's why she isn't at full strength.
Damn it!)"	
Message	None	"(What should I do? How can I save Kurumi?!
How can I save her?!)"	
Message	Shido	"Is it... impossible? Is it because of me that
she can't be saved?"	
Message	Shido	No... I don't want Kurumi to disappear like this!	
Message	Shido	"Someone. Someone please, help me! Help me
save... Kurumi!"	
Message	Main Kurumi	"What the... Why can't I move? Is someone...
intervening?"	
Message	Kurumi	What is... this?	
Message	Shido	What is going on...?	
Message	Main Kurumi	What is... this power?!	
Message	Main Kurumi	"Hihi. Hihi. Kihihihihi! Wonderful! Truly
wonderful!"	
Message	Main Kurumi	Yes, this is it! If I can channel this power...!	
Message	Main Kurumi	"I see. So you miscalculated. Don't tell me you
plan on using this power on Shido-san."	
Message	Main Kurumi	It's fine. I think I have to retreat for now.	
Message	Main Kurumi	But next time, I'll get you!	
Message	Main Kurumi	Kihihihi! Hihi, hihihihi! Kihihihi!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! Are you okay?!	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, I believe so.	
Message	Shido	What's going on?	
Message	Kurumi	Let me explain. I'll tell you everything I know.	
Message	Kurumi	"You've noticed, haven't you? That something
abnormal is occurring in Tengu City."	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. This whole city is surrounded by a barrier
someone has created. A barrier that alters time
and space. You know this, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know.	
Message	Kurumi	"In this barrier, everything is being manipulated.
That's right. Even people's memories..."	
Message	Kurumi	"The world you believe to be real, all of your
memories. There is a chance they have been
altered and placed into your mind."	
Message	Shido	"What...? Is that why my memories have been
so hazy?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Whoever is responsible possesses a great
power. They and they alone."	
Message	Kurumi	"My body... The "nightmare" you know as me,
has noticed this manipulation."	
Message	Kurumi	"If I am able to absorb whomever holds this
power, then I will attain this power as well."	
Message	Kurumi	"The other me has been searching for their
location. She appeared to us as a clone,
just as she has appeared to you before."	
Message	Kurumi	And... I am one of them.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	"As a result, this "nightmare" has approached
the core."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, but will YOU be okay? You're a clone,
but you've fought against your main body."	
Message	Kurumi	"*giggle*... It's all your fault, Shido-san.
Now I'm a mess."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	"But... I regret nothing. Because I've come to
realize the importance of spending time with
you."	
Message	Shido	"But Kurumi, if... your main body has disappeared,
does that mean you're free?"	
Message	Kurumi	No.	
Message	Shido	Huh? But there's no one else tied to you.	
Message	Kurumi	"That's not it. Ultimately, I am a clone, a
fragment of the real Kurumi. When my time
expires, I will disappear."	
Message	Shido	You're kidding, right?!	
Message	Kurumi	Unfortunately not.	
Message	Shido	No!!	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, wait! Where are you going?!	
Message	Kurumi	I'm so glad to have met you...	
Message	Shido	Kurumiiiiiii!
