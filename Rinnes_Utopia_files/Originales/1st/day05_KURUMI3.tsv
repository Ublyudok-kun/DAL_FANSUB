Message	Shido	"Kurumi, what are you thinking? Are you trying
to eat me? Is she the enemy, or...?"	
Message	Shido	The more I think about it, I don't get it...	
Message	Shido	...Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	What are you doing?	
Message	Kurumi	I have been doing some thinking.	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kurumi	What do you think of me?	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	Would you mind telling me?	
Message	Shido	Where is this coming from?	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	I...	
Choice		Want to seal you.	
Choice		Consider you as an "enemy".	
Choice		...Don't know.	
Message	Shido	"...want to seal your powers, so you can be a
normal girl like the others. That's what I want."	
Message	Kurumi	I see.	
Message	Shido	"If we don't do that, then you will bring sadness
to many people. Including yourself."	
Message	Kurumi	"You may have a point. Happiness and I are
not too well acquainted."	
Message	Kurumi	"The past few days have been fun. Like
something out of a dream."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...?	
Message	Kurumi	Good-bye, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey!	
Message	None	"(And that's how... Kurumi disappeared into
the night.)"	
Message	None	"(Ever since that evening, I never saw Kurumi
again. I don't think I'll ever see her again...)"	
Message	None	"(Was I in the wrong...? Maybe if I had said
something better in the moment...)"	
Message	None	(It was a decision I'd have to live with...)	
Message	Shido	"...probably still think of you as an enemy.
I mean, you're still after me, aren't you?"	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, I am.	
Message	Shido	Then I can't trust you fully yet.	
Message	Kurumi	...Very well.	
Message	Shido	"So what's on your mind? What are you trying
to do?"	
Message	Kurumi	"It's unfortunate. I believed that being with you
would allow me to distract myself from those
things, but I suppose I was wrong to think so."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...?	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, you are currently hollow. You
don't look too delicious, but... oh well."	
Message	Kurumi	"You've become too much a part of me.
So... never let yourself escape from me."	
Message	Shido	What? What do you mean?!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, stop! If you continue this, you'll—!	
Message	Kurumi	You still have me wrong.	
Message	Kurumi	I haven't been able to return for some time.	
Message	Shido	K-Kuru—	
Message	Kurumi	"We can be together forever like this, Shido-san.
I must return to where I am needed."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hey Shido-san, please hold onto the memory
of me. All of it, okay?"	
Message	Kurumi	KIHIHI HIHIHIHIHIHIHIHI!	
Message	Shido	"Honestly, I don't know. I have no idea what
kind of person you are."	
Message	Shido	I guess you'd be... an enemy.	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	But you're not a bad person. That, I trust.	
Message	Shido	"So, I still don't know. Those are my honest
feelings."	
Message	Shido	So, would you tell me more about yourself?	
Message	Kurumi	Well...	
Message	Shido	"I'm not going to force it out of you now. You
can tell me when you decide to open up to me."	
Message	Kurumi	There is one thing I can tell you.	
Message	Kurumi	"The shrine on the outskirts of this town.
If you ever need to speak with me, I will
be there."	
Message	Shido	...I see.	
Message	Kurumi	I will be on my way now.	
Message	Shido	All right. You gonna be okay on your own?	
Message	Kurumi	Haha, how comical. I'm a Spirit, remember?	
Message	Shido	Spirit or not, you're still a girl.	
Message	Kurumi	"Someone who needed to be escorted home
last night needn't lecture me on the matter,
but I appreciate the sentiment."	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, I've decided to trust you.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, I trust you.	
Message	None	"(I wonder if Kurumi is opening up to me. I've
been thinking about it, but I have yet to find
an answer.)"	
Message	Shido	In the end, is there nothing I can do?	
Message	None	"(All I can do for now, is bring down Kurumi's
walls.)"	
Message	Shido	...I'll go on a date.	
Message	None	(That's how I'll learn more about Kurumi.)	
Message	Shido	"Taking my time is fine. There are days when...
even Kurumi may appear sad. She's an ordinary
girl."	
Message	Shido	All right, I'm going to go to the shrine tomorrow.	
Message	Shido	...Who is it?	
Message	Rinne	Sorry for visiting so late.	
Message	Shido	"Rinne? Oh, don't worry about it.
Um, is something wrong?"	
Message	Rinne	I wanted to ask you something, Shido.	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Rinne	Yes, well... It appears that you've decided.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Rinne	"You said, you wanted to know more about
Tokisaki-san."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I do.	
Message	Rinne	I see. So, that's your answer then, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it is.	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido. Promise me something.	
Message	Shido	Promise...? What for?	
Message	Rinne	"That you'll take good care of Tokisaki-san from
now on. No matter what happens, you won't
let her go. Promise me."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's gotten into you? You don't need
to tell me that..."	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise. Promise me
that you will think only of Tokisaki-San, or
else your heart will drift away some day."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Please...	
Message	Shido	"Okay, I promise. Man's word. I promise... to take
good care of Kurumi."	
Message	Rinne	"Okay, I knew you'd make that promise with
me."	
Message	Shido	Haha, seriously? What's gotten into you?	
Message	Rinne	"I have faith in you. I trust you, Shido. Don't
forget your promise. Don't break it either, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Rinne	If you break it, then you must pay.	
Message	Shido	I-I know.	
Message	Rinne	I see. As long as you understand.	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's the big deal? Why are you threatening
me?"	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	But...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	"You'll be fine, right? I'm sure if it's Shido,
he'll be fine."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What was that just now?!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne... Did you just see―	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Rinne's gone?
When did she...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is pretty late...
I should head to bed as well."	
Message	???	"...In this dream... no one can become happy...
Shido Itsuka... I hope your next dream will be
a happy one..."
