Message	None	(...Sorry, Kotori. I'll call you back later.)	
Message	None	"(Right now, I want to treasure the time with
Yoshino and Yoshinon. I'm sure even a few
days apart were unbearable for them.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Now then, Shido-kun... are you ready?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Is around here good?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Maybe a little to the right?"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I think, a little more left!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whaaat? Wouldn't that mess up the balance?"	
Message	Yoshino	No... It wouldn't!	
Message	Shido	"Good grief, you two are stubborn...
Can't you compromise?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Nope, this can't be compromised."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes! I drew the picture myself, after all!	
Message	Shido	Haha! You two really are peas in a pod.	
Message	None	(This way, Yoshino and I regained our friend.)	
Message	None	"(I believe, at long last, Yoshino, Yoshinon and I
had entered a sort of kinship.)"	
Message	None	"(Compared to before, Yoshino depends on
Yoshinon far less.)"	
Message	None	"(Despite being friends, Yoshino often relied on
Yoshinon far too much; unable to do anything
herself, unable to speak with others. No longer.)"	
Message	None	"(In her own way, Yoshino is becoming more
independent. Yoshinon seems to support her well,
so that Yoshino doesn't fall on old habits.)"	
Message	None	"(As for myself, I wish to watch over Yoshino from
now on, ever close to her.)"	
Message	None	"(Forever and ever, always. No matter how much
time passes, surely our friendship will remain.)"	
Message	Shido	Are you done yet?	
Message	Yoshino	P-Please... Wait a moment...	
Message	Shido	Roger that.	
Message	Shido	Um, still not ready yet?	
Message	Yoshino	"N-Not... yet, but... Sh-Shido-san...
P-Please help meee..."	
Message	Shido	What's wrong?!	
Message	Yoshino	A-Augh...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, I'm coming in, okay?	
Message	Shido	Are you okay...? Wait, h-hey! What's going on?!	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I'm sorry... I-I can't...
put this on, by myself..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoohoo, Shido-kun, what a lucky lecher you are!\nGood grief. Always need to be on guard with you."	
Message	Shido	Hey now...	
Message	None	(Just what in the world is Yoshinon suggesting...)	
Message	Yoshino	Um. Could you please... help me wear this?	
Message	Shido	E-Err, but...	
Message	Yoshino	You can't...?	
Message	Shido	Oogh. Aah... All right then.	
Message	Yoshinon	"It's an emergency, it can't be helped."	
Message	Shido	I-I get it already! Here, give me a hand.	
Message	None	"(It does seem pretty tough for Yoshino to
put on this outfit by herself.)"	
Message	None	"(But if the two of them tell me they want to
see how cute they look now, I can't refuse.
As if I didn't want to see them either.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"I thought Yoshino would've shaped up by\nnow, huh?"	
Message	Yoshino	"B-But... I've stopped... relying on Yoshinon...
haven't I?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yup, yup. You're right, but... to that extent,\nyou've gotten pretty clingy with Shido-kun,\nhm?"	
Message	Yoshino	It's all fine... with Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	I-Is it...?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Boy golly, you sure like to fawn when it\ncomes to Shido-kun, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	Aah... Oogh.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, maybe this won't turn out so bad\neither way."	
Message	Shido	Jeez. You just say whatever you like, don't you?	
Message	Shido	Here, all finished.	
Message	Yoshino	H-How's it look?	
Message	Shido	...Huh? Ah, yeah! I-It really suits you, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	Eh hee hee...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aw gee, Shido-kun. Getting all embarrassed like\nthat! How cute. You two are so cute. *whistle*!"	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon, stop teasing!	
Message	Yoshino	...Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	...Hmmm?	
Message	Yoshino	I'm... very happy...	
Message	Shido	Mm, yeah...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino is here, and so is Yoshinon. Now, we
can all laugh and spend time together. Good
times will roll. As long as I never let them go.)"	
Message	Shido	I was about to say the same thing.	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes!
