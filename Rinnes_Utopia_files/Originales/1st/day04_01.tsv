Message	???	"Shido...et up... How much longer do you plan
on sleeping?"	
Message	Shido	Rinne... Sorry, just a little longer.	
Message	???	...!	
Message	Shido	OUCH!	
Message	Kotori	Who you calling Rinne?	
Message	Shido	Ouchhhh. Hm? K-Kotori, why?	
Message	Kotori	"How long do you plan on sleeping? Weren't you
the one who was making breakfast today?"	
Message	Shido	Oh! That's right. Rinne's not coming, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Not coming? You're the one who told her not
to come, remember? Jeez, you're trying too hard
to act cool in front of Rinne."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I mean she may be our childhood friend, but
we're relying on her too much. Yesterday, she came
over to make us dinner even though she was busy."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Rinne's the type of person who would break
her back for other people, and wouldn't say
no even if she wanted to."	
Message	Kotori	...Sounds like someone I know.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Kotori	"Nope. So, why are you just standing there?
Who do you think you are, not even changing?"	
Message	Kotori	"Or, do you want your adorable little sister
to help you? Shido, you're a piece of work."	
Message	Shido	"WHAT?! It's only because I was talking to you
about Rinne."	
Message	Kotori	"I know that. She's my childhood friend, too.
Anyways, isn't there something you need to
do right now?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. I'll make something right now.	
Message	Kotori	That's the way... HEYYYY!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's wrong, Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, you're such a slacker. Don't you know that
it's starting?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?! What's starting?!	
Message	Kotori	The morning horoscope, DUH!	
Message	None	"(Despite being in her black ribbon state,
Kotori's still Kotori...)"	
Message	Shido	All right. I'll whip up something good.	
Message	Shido	"Hmm, what do we have? I guess I'll use
whatever."	
Message	Shido	All right. This looks good.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, were you able to watch the horoscope?
How's your luck looking today?"	
Message	Kotori	Hmm... It's all right.	
Message	Shido	"I see. HEY! Are you eating candy before
breakfast again?!"	
Message	Kotori	Who cares? I'll eat breakfast, too.	
Message	Shido	*sigh*...	
Message	Kotori	"You know, if you want your brain to work,
you need sugar. I'm just getting the proper
sugar intake."	
Message	Kotori	Unlike you, Shido, I have much to think about.	
Message	Shido	I have no idea what you're talking about.	
Message	Kotori	You just lack the ability to understand.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Then, why didn't you say so from the
get-go?!"	
Message	Kotori	"Yappy men aren't attractive. You know that,
right? Oh, look. The Tengu Tower is on TV.
How strange."	
Message	Shido	"Tengu Tower, huh? You're right. Ever since the
Neo Tengu Tower was built, no one ever mentions
the original."	
Message	Kotori	"Man, talk about stolen thunder. Not like it
was much of a tourist spot to begin with."	
Message	Shido	"Right. I think I went back in the day, but
I don't even remember what was there."	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Tengu Tower is a monument, right?	
Message	Shido	What? Was it?	
Message	Kotori	"It used to be popular, remember? There was
the myth that if you confess your love in front
of the monument, you'll be together forever."	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	None	"(Something feels off. That monument. Hmm...
I guess I can find the time to check it out
soon.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh. The water is boiling. I'll prepare
breakfast in no time."	
Message	Yoshino	G...! Good morning, Shido-san...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yooo-hooo Shido-kun! Morning!"	
Message	Shido	"Yo, good morning Yoshino, Yoshinon. I'm
preparing breakfast, so take a seat."	
Message	Yoshino	U...Um! L-Let me help!	
Message	Shido	What? You?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Rinne isn't coming over today, right?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, right...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino thought you might have difficulty, so\nshe's been worried all morning. You just\nrecovered, so we didn't know if you'd be okay!"	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Then, I guess it'd be nice if you can
help me."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay! I-I'll try my best!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Isn't that nice, Yoshino? I'm sure Shido-kun's\nheart will melt when he sees how adorably\nyou cook!"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, Yoshinon! When you say that, it makes
it harder for Yoshino to help me."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Mmm, I wonder. I don't think so."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh, let's get started. Yoshino, could you pass
me the soy sauce?"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay!	
Message	Yoshino	Oh!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yikes!"	
Message	Shido	"A-Are you okay, Yoshino?! Did it get on your
clothes?!"	
Message	Yoshino	I... I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	"This is nothing. Were your clothes stained?
It's pretty tough to remove soy sauce."	
Message	Shido	"Good, seems like you're fine. It's okay to be
nervous now and then."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino! Don't worry!"	
Message	Yoshino	I... I'll wipe it now!	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry. Let me. Yoshino, would you mind
grabbing some plates for me?"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay!	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yoshino?! Are you okay?! A-Are you hurt
at all?!"	
Message	Yoshino	W...Waaaah!	
Message	Yoshinon	"OHHH! Shido, now you've done it!"	
Message	Shido	What?! Is it my fault?	
Message	None	"(I guess it is, huh? Yoshino can only use one
hand. I shouldn't have asked for her help.)"	
Message	None	(Oh, seems like the pot's boiling.)	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, I know! Hey, Yoshino...?	
Message	Yoshino	Wha...?	
Message	Shido	"This pot seems to be boiling, so could you open
the lid and check?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh. Th...The lid over there?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Oh! It's hot. I turned off the fire, but be
careful, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	O...Okay...	
Message	None	"(This pot is made of metal, which means
you need an oven mitt to take the lid off, but
if my assumption is correct...)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"HOT! IT'S HOT! YOSHINO! HURRY HURRY!"	
Message	None	(All right! Yoshino used Yoshinon as a glove!)	
Message	Yoshino	O...Okay!	
Message	Shido	"Good job, Yoshino! You can just place the
lid there!"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay! OOOOO...Over here?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah! There is fine!	
Message	Yoshino	...! I-It seems to be boiling well!	
Message	Shido	Oh! Good job, Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	It's all thanks to Yoshinon... for being there!	
Message	Shido	"I think it was a good team effort between
you and Yoshinon."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ahahaha. Yoshino can do whatever she\nputs her mind to. Ahh, that was so hot."	
Message	Yoshino	"S...Sorry, Yoshinon! Shido-san... Th-Thank
you... so much."	
Message	Yoshinon	"I guess this is what Yoshino and Yoshinon\nare made of, right? Aren't we amazing?"	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... It was amazing. I'm glad you didn't
get burned. Good job, Yoshinon!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aw, shucks. You sure know how to flatter.\nWhat do you want, since you're egging me on\nso much?"	
Message	Shido	"Hm. Well, if this is what you're made of, do
you think you could put all of the food into
the bento box? Can you do it, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes! I-I will do my best!	
Message	Yoshinon	"I gueeeess. Well, I guess Yoshino and\nYoshinon will go all out and work hard\nin Rinne's absence!"	
Message	Shido	All right! Thanks!	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay!	
Message	Yoshinon	"You got it!"
