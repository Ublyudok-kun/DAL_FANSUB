Message	Shido	It's already lunchtime. Time is flying.	
Message	Shido	Hm. I wonder where everyone's gonna eat...	
Message	Tohka	Ah! You're late, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Oh, there you all are!	
Message	Tohka	Sorry, Shido. I was hungry, so I started without you.	
Message	Shido	"I don't blame you. Eating after all that activity
probably makes it taste that much better, too."	
Message	Tohka	Exactly! Rinne's bento tastes really good, too!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe, thank you. That makes me so happy.	
Message	Origami	Shido... ah....	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Ahhh.	
Message	Shido	Oh... uh...	
Message	Tohka	Hey! What do you think you're doing?!	
Message	Origami	"I have nothing to explain to you.
Ahhh..."	
Message	Tohka	"GRR! You can't "Ahh" him before me!
Origami Tobiichi, that is not fair at all!"	
Message	Origami	"I'm just sharing my lunch with Shido.
You have no right to "ahh" him as you are
eating Rinne Sonogami's bento."	
Message	Tohka	W-What?! Rinne's bento is my bento!	
Message	Origami	"Your logic makes no sense. If you were to
"ahh" him and he was to be satisfied, this
achievement would be Rinne's, not yours."	
Message	Tohka	"Shut up! Shido, this food is better!
Just hurry up and "ahh!""	
Message	Shido	O-Okay! Come on, you two need to calm down!	
Message	Shido	W-Why don't I eat them one at a time?	
Message	Origami	I was the one that did "ahh" first. Shido, ah.	
Message	Tohka	Grr...! H-Hurry up and eat it, Shido! Ahhh!	
Message	Shido	"MMM! Tohka, you're pretty much shoving it
in my mouth at the same time!"	
Message	Origami	Ah.	
Message	Tohka	GR! AHH AHHH!	
Message	Shido	Hey! MBB! I still have some in my m―	
Message	Origami	AH. AHH. Ahh.	
Message	Tohka	GAHH! AHH AHH AHH AHHHH!	
Message	Shido	Hey! BLRG?! Urgpgh! *grunt*!	
Message	Origami	...?!	
Message	Tohka	MM...?!	
Message	Rinne	Oh?!	
Message	None	(T-They gave me too much! I can't breathe!)	
Message	Rinne	S-Shido?! Have some tea!	
Message	Shido	...MMM!	
Message	Tohka	"Are you okay, Shido?! GRR! Origami Tobiichi!
It's all your fault Shido choked!"	
Message	Origami	"Impossible. That makes no sense.
This happened because of your impatience."	
Message	Rinne	"Let's make sure to chew carefully and enjoy
all of this food we're eating. Come on. I won't
be happy if you all waste your food."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yeah. You're right.	
Message	Shido	Ah... I-I was spared...	
Message	Rinne	Shido, you need to be careful.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Sorry. Thanks for saving me, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"Goodness, Shido. Okay. Let's start over
and get through this meal peacefully."	
Message	Tohka	O-Okay.	
Message	Origami	Rinne Sonogami... a powerful enemy.	
Message	Tamae	Hi, everyone... Good job with Sports Day!	
Message	Tamae	"Thanks to everyone for all their hard work!
We scored very well, but unfortunately we
couldn't win the overall competition."	
Message	Tamae	"It was maybe a little bit of a letdown, but we
tried our best out there, so don't be too down, okay?"	
Message	Tamae	"You got some fresh air and had a nice break from
our regular day, and that's the most we can ask for, yeah?"	
Message	Tamae	Uh...	
Message	None	"(What she's saying makes sense, but everyone
worked so hard to win. They must be sad.)"	
Message	None	"(Who am I to say anything? I just stood on the
sidelines... but everyone really was trying their
very best...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, was it my fault because I lost?
Ugh. I wish I practiced more..."	
Message	Shido	It's not your fault, Tohka. Don't let it get to you.	
Message	Tohka	Yeah? You really think so?	
Message	None	"(I know why she'd think so. Origami and Tohka both
lost their matches... and Rinne didn't.)"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(I usually can't read Origami, but it seems like she's
a little sad about it. I wonder if losing the match
was a big shock to her.)"	
Message	None	"(When the people who are usually smiling aren't...
everyone can tell the mood goes down a little, huh?)"	
Message	Shido	Rinne, are you alright?	
Message	Rinne	We lost... I'm really sorry.	
Message	Shido	Huh? But, you won, Rinne. It's definitely not your fault.	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Oh, but... well, I just thought if I tried my hardest,
everyone would have tried their best, too."	
Message	Shido	"Well, all I know is that you gave it your all.
That's worth something."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, Shido. That really makes me happy.	
Message	Shido	O-Of course...	
Message	Rinne	Oh, sorry. Did I say something weird?	
Message	Shido	No, not at all...	
Message	Rinne	I'm just tired. I'm really okay.	
Message	Shido	All right. I just like to see you acting like yourself, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	What?	
Message	Shido	Well... I mean, you look the best when you have a smile on...	
Message	Rinne	Oh, okay... thank you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Tamae	"Alright, everyone! Now that you've got your exercise
in, it's almost time to start your exams! Let's switch
gears and try just as hard in your studies."	
Message	Tamae	"I know, I know. No matter how much you hate it,
exam day is quickly approaching so prepare yourselves!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, sensei! Where's Tonomachi?	
Message	Tamae	Oh, don't worry. I took him to the hospital.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. I see.	
Message	Tamae	"I'm sure they're treating him to a physical right now.
He'll be in great shape before you know it."	
Message	Shido	G-Got it. Thank you...	
Message	Tamae	"It's my job to be concerned about the health
of my students, too!"	
Message	Shido	"(This is karma, isn't it? I guess that's a fine
medicine for old Tonomachi.)"	
Message	Tamae	Oh? Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?	
Message	Tamae	"I don't see Tonomachi-kun. Weren't you guys
going to be spectating together?"	
Message	Shido	Oh. Uh...	
Message	Guy Student A	"Tonomachi seemed like he got over his chronic illness,
so I tried to get him to play some soccer but then
he just ran away!"	
Message	Guy Student B	"I'm sure he's still running around somewhere.
If I find him, I'll give him a good talking to."	
Message	None	(That bastard! He ran for it!)	
Message	Tamae	U-Uh... was Tonomachi-kun looking okay?	
Message	Guy Student A	I'd say he was looking pretty good to me!	
Message	Tamae	I-I see. Just as long as he's in good health.	
Message	Tamae	"Um... w-well that concludes homeroom for today.
Please have a safe trip home."	
Message	None	(*sigh* He really doesn't learn...)	
Message	None	"(I guess I'll just try my best not to get too
involved with Tonomachi's schemes...)"	
Message	Tamae	Oh? Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?	
Message	Tamae	"I don't see Tonomachi-kun. Weren't you guys
going to be spectating together?"	
Message	Shido	Oh. Uh...	
Message	Ai	"Oh, sensei! Tonomachi-kun said he felt sick
and so he just went home."	
Message	Tamae	R-Really?	
Message	Mai	Sorry, he told me to tell you but I forgot.	
Message	Tamae	"Ah, is that so? Maybe I should have taken
him to the hospital when I had the chance..."	
Message	Mii	"It's okay. He was breathing normally when I saw
him last. He can probably get himself to the
hospital if he needs to."	
Message	Shido	W-What did you girls do to Tonomachi?	
Message	Mii	If you tell anyone about us, you're next...	
Message	Shido	Ah?!	
Message	Tamae	U-Uh... so Tonomachi-kun was really looking okay?	
Message	Tamae	"I never thought a boy as healthy as him could
develop such a chronic condition.I hope he gets
it treated quickly."	
Message	Ai	"Yes, I'm sure the professionals will be able to make
sure he gets broken in real well... I mean, treated real
well! He'll be fine by tomorrow!"	
Message	Tamae	I-I see. Okay...	
Message	Tamae	Well, that's all for today. Everyone get home safe!	
Message	None	(I didn't see or hear anything...)	
Message	None	(Now... who to ask out on a date today?)
