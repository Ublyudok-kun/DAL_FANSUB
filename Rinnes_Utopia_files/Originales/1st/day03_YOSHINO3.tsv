Message	Shido	"Yes?
...Come in."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Yoshino...
You're back again. What's wrong?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Yoshino...
What's wrong? Did something happen?"	
Message	Yoshino	W-Well... Today, um... Yoshinon wants to...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Yoshinon wants to talk...? To me...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, what's with that tone?! Is it not okay for\nYoshinon to want to talk to you, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No, of course not... I just thought
it was a rare event."	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon... What do you... want to talk about?	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's... a secret～!"	
Message	Yoshino	A... secret?	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right! Yoshinon and Yoshino, we're each\ngoing to have a secret conversation with you!"	
Message	Shido	A secret conversation... Why so suddenly?	
Message	Yoshinon	"You're gonna make me say it, Shido-kun?\nAww gee, even though you know already?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"...Just between you and me, a secret between two\npeople has the effect of deepening their\nrelationship!"	
Message	Shido	D-Deepening our... relationship?!	
Message	None	(What the hell is Yoshinon saying?!)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aww, good grief, Shido-kun. You just imagined\nsomething pervy, didn't you? That's not it,\nI meant in a platonic way!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"You want to get closer to Shido-kun,\nright Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Yeah... I-I want to... become closer friends...
with Shido-san."	
Message	Yoshinon	"If you share secrets during a secret\nconversation, it has the effect of\nstrengthening your bond."	
Message	Yoshino	Let's... have a secret conversation...	
Message	Shido	Er, well... I don't mind, but...	
Message	Yoshinon	"All right, it's decided! Now then, let's begin\nthe Nighttime Secret Conversation Tournament!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well then, let's start first with Yoshino.\nI'll cover my ears!"	
Message	None	(Covering his ears? My, how skillful...)	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... my, secret is...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well... you don't have to push
yourself to say it, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	N-No... I-I can tell you...!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Then, I'll listen.	
Message	Yoshino	"My... secret is... um... I'm shy, and...
I'm scared of... people I don't know..."	
Message	Shido	A-Ahh... right...	
Message	None	"(Of course, that's something one could tell just
by looking. I don't really feel that’s on the
level of a secret...)"	
Message	Yoshino	"And then... in the city... you know?
Um... there are people... who talk to you..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you mean the people who give out street
surveys and tissue packs? It does seem like you
wouldn't do well with them, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	"Th-That's it...! Um... I'm scared, of being talked
to... so when I see tissues, I end up
running away..."	
Message	Shido	"Just from looking at tissues?
Hmmm... Is that some sort of
post-traumatic stress?"	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I don't know. But... I need to overcome this...
Somehow..."	
Message	Shido	I see. Good for you. Do your best, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	...Yeah!	
Message	Shido	"Your secret is over now, Yoshino.
Heeey, Yoshinon. It's your turn next!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"It's over? Is it over?! How was it?!\nYoshino's secret... Was it juicy?"	
Message	Shido	Who knows... It's a secret.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ooohh, you're such a meanie, Shido-kun!! But,\nit's fine. Yoshinon will respect Yoshino's\nsecret!!"	
Message	Yoshino	Thank you, Yoshinon...	
Message	Shido	"So, now I have to listen to your secret,
right Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yes, that's right～! Now then, you have to cover\nyour ears this time, Yoshino!"	
Message	Yoshino	"My ears... Oh... because Yoshinon's here...
I can't cover... with both of my hands..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, of course. Then... I think if you put these
headphones on, it should be all right."	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Shido	"Listen to some music for a while.
...All right, Yoshinon. Go ahead and tell me."	
Message	Yoshinon	"......"	
Message	Shido	"...Hmm?
What's wrong, Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"......"	
Message	Shido	What on earth are you...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Okay! Is it okay?!"	
Message	Shido	Whoa, you surprised me!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, you're listening, right? I'm gonna\ntalk, okay? I'm gonna tell you my secret now,\nokay?"	
Message	None	"(That's right, Yoshino's covering her ears, so
Yoshinon can't hear me, either. For now,
I guess I'll respond to her with a gesture.)"	
Message	None	(*Nod.*)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Okay! Then, Yoshinon's Full-Disclosure Talk Show\nwill now begin!!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"The secret that Yoshinon will tell you...\nis about Yoshino～"	
Message	Shido	So it really was about Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun, Yoshino really trusts you a lot."	
Message	Yoshinon	"It might be pretty obvious, but I know that when\nyou're around, Yoshino keeps growing in a good\ndirection～"	
Message	Yoshinon	"It really makes your heart grow quickly when\nthere's someone that's important to you～"	
Message	Yoshinon	"But, on that topic, Yoshinon sometimes thinks...\nWhat kind of effect does Yoshinon have\non Yoshino?"	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshinon always did things while thinking of\nYoshino. But... Yoshinon wonders if what Yoshinon\ndid for Yoshino was really for her sake..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"......"	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"......"	
Message	Shido	...Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshinon	"...Shido-kun."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah?	
Message	Yoshinon	"...When the time comes, take\ncare of Yoshino, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"...If, possibly... when the time comes that\nYoshinon can't be by Yoshino's side... I'm sure\nthat Yoshino is going to be lonely and cry."	
Message	Yoshinon	"So... during that time... if that ever happens...\nI want you to comfort Yoshino, Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, what does that...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"...Okay, secret talk is over!!\nIt's okay for you to listen again, Yoshino～!!"	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What did you, talk about...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whaaat, you're gonna ask?\nAll this hush-hush will be\nfor nothing if I tell you!"	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh, th-that's right...
I-I'm sorry..."	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san? Is... something wrong...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, er... It's nothing, really...	
Message	None	"(Yoshinon seemed to be acting somewhat different
than she usually does... Was it just me...?)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, sorry to keep you all waiting! Now, for\ntoday's main event! It's time for Shido-kun\nto reveal his secret!!"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshinon wants to hear your secret, Shido-kun!"	
Message	Yoshino	M-Me too... I'd like... to hear...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Give us a real good one! If it's boring,\nwe'll have to start all over!"	
Message	Shido	Er, ah... Th-That's a little... I'd rather not...	
Message	Yoshinon	"No, no! After hearing Yoshino's and Yoshinon's\nsecrets, it's not fair for you to run away.\nRight, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	That's not... fair...	
Message	Shido	D-Do I really have to...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Of course! Yeah!!\nSe—cret!! Se—cret!!"	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	None	"(Once again, another part of my dark history
is going to be revealed, huh...?)"
