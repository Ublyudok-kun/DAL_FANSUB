Message	None	"(I somehow ended up on a walk alone... I should
have invited Tohka out so we could have
gone together.)"	
Message	None	"(It seemed like Tohka was kind of
depressed, too...)"	
Message	None	(All right, I guess I'll turn around.)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka! Could you please come here a second?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is it, Shido? Are you going out?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, just taking a walk. If you're up for it,
would you like to go together? It'd be a good
change of pace."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! If you are going, Shido, then I will go too!	
Message	Shido	Then let's go wander around.	
Message	Tohka	Yes.	
Message	Shido	"Now then, we've headed out in no particular
direction. Where should we go?"	
Message	Tohka	Is there any place you'd like to go, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Somewhere I'd like to go, huh...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, do you want to go to that park over there?	
Message	Tohka	The park?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it's surprisingly quiet and nice.
I used to come here a lot with Kotori to play."	
Message	Tohka	I see. Let's try going, then.	
Message	Shido	All right.	
Message	Shido	Now that we're here, what should we do?	
Message	Tohka	How did you used to play with Kotori?	
Message	Shido	"Let's see. We used to build sandcastles, sit
together on the same swing and get in trouble,
or slide down the slide upside-down."	
Message	Shido	"We did so much, I can barely remember it all.
I'm feeling really nostalgic..."	
Message	Tohka	"I see. Then today, the two of us
can play together!"	
Message	Shido	A-All right. Then...	
Choice		Ride the swings.	
Choice		Slide down the slide.	
Message	Shido	Let's get on the swings.	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, are those the swings?	
Message	Shido	"What? Is it your first time, Tohka?
Ah, I suppose that's right..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm! D-Do you not like that it is my first time?	
Message	Shido	"No! It's nothing like that!
A-Anyway, try getting on.
It's easier than it looks."	
Message	Tohka	Hm, I sit here, right?	
Message	Shido	"Er, ummm... Tohka? It's not like
riding a horse, so you don't straddle it;
you look this way and sit on it like a chair."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, then like this.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's right. So first, I'll push you from
behind. Once you get enough momentum,
I'll let go, okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, I understand!	
Message	Shido	Here we go! Ready, set...	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! This is a wonderful feeling, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Then I'll push a little harder! Here!	
Message	Tohka	"Ooohh! It feels even better than before!
It almost feels like I'm floating in the air!"	
Message	Shido	Haha, it's fun, right? I'll let go now, okay?	
Message	Shido	"After that, you can gain more momentum with
your feet. I'll sit on the one beside you. Let's
see who can swing higher!"	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	Shido	Hm? T-Tohka... what's wrong?	
Message	Tohka	"Sh-Shido, you and Kotori used to sit on this
together, didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? Er, well, that was when Kotori was still
small... If two high school students were sitting
on the same swing together, it―"	
Message	Tohka	"Y-You could swing with Kotori,
but you can't with me?"	
Message	Shido	Oof...	
Message	None	"(Hm... neither of us is that heavy so... maybe
it'd be okay?)"	
Message	Tohka	"Grrr... Why is it with Kotori, and not me??
C-Could it be that you don't want to sully
the memory with anyone else?!"	
Message	Shido	W-Wait just a sec! Where'd you get that from?!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph! If that's not the case, then you wouldn't
mind riding it together like you did with Kotori,
right?"	
Message	None	"(At this rate, even though it was a nice date,
Tohka's mood might get worse if I don't go
along with it...)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm? Kannazuki-san?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"Shido-kun, it seems as though you're in a\ntough spot. Am I right?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Pardon my intrusion. I was observing Tohka-san\nfrom the monitor over here. Is there some sort\nof trouble?"	
Message	Shido	Actually...	
Message	Kannazuki	"What's the big deal? Couples use swings all the\ntime to spice things up! I hear it's terrific when\nused as a reward. Wouldn't you agree, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"If possible, I would wish to effectively utilize\nthe chain portion of the swing while riding\ntogether, but―"	
Message	Shido	"No, Kannazuki-san, please stop talking about that!
I'm just not sure whether I should ride together
with Tohka..."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Ah, right. Still, I see no reason to worry over\nit. It should be a simple, 'Hey you, ride\nwith me.'"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Her stress levels have risen in the time you've\nkept her waiting. If you refuse now, you should\nprobably prepare yourself for the rampage."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	(That has to be a joke, right?)	
Message	Kannazuki	"You don't have much time, you know."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Now, then... It's become necessary for me to\ndevise a plan to get the commander to swing with\nme in such a fashion, so I will take my leave."	
Message	Kannazuki	"One last thing, Shido-kun... Know that the\nimpossible can become possible."	
Message	None	(M-Maybe I should stop asking him for advice...)	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, who was that? No, that doesn't matter...
If you're finished talking, then hurry and get on!"	
Message	Shido	Ummm...	
Choice		All right! Let's ride it together!	
Choice		We'd better not.	
Message	Shido	All right. Then... Let's try it.	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! Really?! Then here, you sit down first!	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Message	Shido	―Urgh! T-Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	Y-You idiot! H-Hurry, move the swing!	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Hold on tight, okay?	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka, are you okay? Are you scared?	
Message	Tohka	No, I'm not scared. Even faster is fine!	
Message	Shido	All right, just don't get thrown off, okay?!	
Message	Tohka	R-Right!	
Message	None	"(With each swing, a smell of shampoo came from her
hair. Her soft weight on my thighs and the warmth
between our chests increased our heartbeats...)"	
Message	None	"(It was strange, I felt both nervous and
reassured. I suppose... it felt like I became one
with Tohka. It was a very comforting feeling...)"	
Message	None	(I hope Tohka feels the same way...)	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, swinging on the swing was quite a
wonderful feeling, wasn't it? Let's come
here to ride it again."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. If you had fun, Tohka, then I'm glad.	
Message	Tohka	Hm... W-Was it not fun for you, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"N-No, it's not like that. It's been a while since
I've ridden a swing, so I felt like a kid.
It was fun."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm. I see. Then I'm glad, too!	
Message	None	"(Whew... It looks like Tohka is happy. It was a
good thing I went all in and rode it with her...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm! Let's head home; I'm starting to get hungry.	
Message	Shido	"Haha. That time already, huh?
All right, let's go home."	
Message	Shido	"W-We probably shouldn't. The swing is for
children, so if high-schoolers like us got on it
together, it might break..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm... I see. Then it can't be helped...	
Message	Tohka	"I will ask just in case. It's not like you don't
want to ride it with me, yes?"	
Message	Shido	"Of course! If we could, I would totally want to!
ASAP! Now!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm! Then it is fine!	
Message	None	(Whew...)	
Message	None	"(After that, we got on different swings, and had
fun competing to see who could swing higher.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, swinging on the swings was quite a
wonderful feeling, wasn't it? Let's come
here to ride them again."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. If you had fun, Tohka, then I'm glad.	
Message	Tohka	Hm... W-Was it not fun for you, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"N-No, it's not like that. It's been a while since
I've ridden a swing, so I felt like a kid.
It was fun."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm. I see. Then I'm glad, too!	
Message	None	"(Whew... It looks like Tohka is happy. It was a
good thing I came here with her...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm! Let's head home; I'm starting to get hungry.	
Message	Shido	"Haha. That time already, huh?
All right, let's go home."	
Message	Shido	All right! Let's play on the slide!	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! The one where you slide upside-down!	
Message	Shido	"No... That's not actually the way you're supposed
to slide. In fact, good girls and boys shouldn't
do it like that."	
Message	Tohka	"Why is it wrong? You slid that way with Kotori,
didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, yeah, but. That was when we were kids...
And we were still little..."	
Message	Tohka	"All right, I will slide the same
way you and Kotori did!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Tohka! Just wait a sec!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. I just have to be upside-down from this point,
correct?"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka! Stop! It's dangerous!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm! I said I will slide, so I will slide!
You can stay there and watch, Shido! Here I go!"	
Message	Shido	―Whoa, hey!	
Message	Tohka	W-Whooooa!	
Message	Tohka	Gah...!	
Message	Shido	"Tohka! Whoa! Hey, are you okay?! Y-You're in a
pretty rough position...!"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Tohka	Wh-Wh-Wha-Wha-What are you thinking, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	No! I-I'm not thinking anything!	
Message	Tohka	"R-Really?! Y-You're not thinking of
anything indecent..?!"	
Message	Shido	I-I promise I'm not!	
Message	Tohka	"If you really insist, Shido,
then I'll believe you."	
Message	Shido	L-Let's... go home for today.	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...
