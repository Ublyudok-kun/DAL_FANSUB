Message	None	"(No good... No good... No, no, no, no...!
Am I really different?
Does it mean I can't be the same as them?)"	
Message	None	(At this rate... Eden... my paradise, will...)	
Message	None	(I must do whatever it takes at this point...)	
Message	None	(With my own hands...)	
Message	???	...do...wake...rning.	
Message	???	Shido? Are you awake?	
Message	Shido	Hm? R-Rinne...?	
Message	Rinne	Good morning, Shido.	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	"What's wrong, Shido? Is there something
on my face?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, no... It's nothing. It's just, um...	
Message	Rinne	"Goodness, are you still half asleep? Come on,
wake up and wash your face. Breakfast is ready."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(No matter how many times I try to shake it off,
what Kotori said yesterday won't leave my mind.)"	
Message	None	"(I was thinking that as I stared
at Rinne's face...)"	
Message	None	(That must have creeped her out...)	
Message	None	(I wonder... why I'm so bothered by Rinne...)	
Message	Rinne	Shido? Are you ready?	
Message	Shido	Ah! Y-Yeah! I'm going now!	
Message	Shido	Sorry for keeping you waiting, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	No, it's all right.	
Message	Shido	Th-Then, let's go?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	U-Ummm...	
Message	None	"(Why am I even trying to start conversation?
My mind's completely blank...!)"	
Message	Shido	E-Errr...	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?	
Message	Rinne	Are you free after school today, too?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I am... In fact, I'll make sure I am since
you're the one asking, Rinne."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks. Then, after school?	
Message	Shido	G-Gotcha!	
Message	None	(It's already after school...)	
Message	None	(I feel like today passed by so quickly...)	
Message	Rinne	Shido? You're not getting ready to go home?	
Message	Shido	Oh, R-Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"Come on, we don't have much time, you know?
Hurry, hurry!"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, wait, Rinne! We don't have
to rush so much..."	
Message	Rinne	"Didn't I just say time's ticking?
We can't slow it down, so hurry up and get ready."	
Message	Shido	Roger that.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Hmm?	
Message	Shido	Um... Yesterday's date... I'm sorry.	
Message	Rinne	No. I'm the one at fault... Everything's my fault.	
Message	Shido	"No, to be honest, I wasn't able to concentrate
fully. Or more like, my head was somewhere else..."	
Message	Rinne	"If you say so, Shido... I know!
Let's say we're even, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, we're even. Ahaha...	
Message	Rinne	Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	"Um, n-now that I think of it, we used to play
at this park a lot, didn't we? With Kotori."	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Oh, yeah. On the swings and the slide...
Scribbling messages on the bench. Right?"	
Message	Shido	"That's right. Kotori begged me to ride on the
swing with her, even though I told her it was
dangerous."	
Message	Rinne	Yup.	
Message	Shido	"I was worried about it at the time, but now
I suppose it's a precious memory."	
Message	Rinne	"That's right. As we get older, there are some
things you can't do together anymore."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... So, what did we do together?	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I mean, what did you like
doing here in the park?"	
Message	Rinne	Th-That’s... You know, I think...?	
Message	Shido	Hmm? Hmmm... I can't remember.	
Message	Rinne	It really might be no good anymore...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	"Nothing... You're pretty forgetful, Shido.
And it was a long time ago... It can't be helped."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... I-I'm sorry... I guess I'm lacking in the
childhood friend department. At this rate,
you could even say I'm a failure."	
Message	Rinne	"That's not true.
Goodness... You keep apologizing today, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry― Er, wait...	
Message	Rinne	See, just as I was saying it. Hehe...	
Message	Shido	I-I can't help it. I do it without thinking.	
Message	Rinne	"I know, I know. Hehe... It really is fun
being with you, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Thanks...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	"It's nothing. There's somewhere I'd like to go
today. Will you come along with me, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Of course!	
Message	Shido	...Is this the place you wanted to go?	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	"Th-There's absolutely no one around. Haha...
When it's this quiet, I feel a bit nervous..."	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	Rinne...?	
Message	Rinne	Hey Shido, can I ask you one thing?	
Message	Shido	Huh? What is it?	
Message	Rinne	"Just now at the park, you said that during our
date, your mind was somewhere else... Why?"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... About that...	
Message	Rinne	I thought that... maybe I did something bad.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no... Actually, when I was on the date with
you, Rinne, something floated in..."	
Message	Rinne	Floated in...? Like what?	
Message	Shido	"Lately, I've been feeling the usual déjà vu... But
when I really think about it, I have memories of
going on the same kind of dates before..."	
Message	Rinne	The same...?	
Message	Shido	"I mean, I know what I'm saying sounds weird,
but... It had been bothering me for a while, and―"	
Message	Rinne	I see...	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. It was inconsiderate to you, Rinne.
Jeez, I really am apologizing a lot today. Haha..."	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Rinne	"When you realize that you buttoned something up
the wrong way... What do you think you should do?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?	
Message	Rinne	"Once you've done it, no matter how well you try to
line everything else up, that part is still left
open... And the gap just gets bigger and bigger."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	So... That's why I'm thinking of this.	
Message	Rinne	"It might be better to give up on everything for
once... and start over from the beginning."	
Message	Shido	Umm... Rinne...?	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, I'm sorry. Forget about what I just said...
It's nothing."	
Message	Shido	A-Are you sure...?	
Message	None	(It sounded pretty serious to me, but...)	
Message	Rinne	Shido, could you wait a moment?	
Message	Shido	Wait... Where are you going?	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, it's a secret.
You shouldn't ask a girl things like that."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...!	
Message	Rinne	Goodness, still apologizing?	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry. It might be good to try and
be a little careful."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'll do that. I have to watch out...	
Message	Shido	"Haha, you're apologizing too, Rinne...
It's just nothing but apologies..."	
Message	None	(Hm? Wait. Why did Rinne apologize...?)	
Message	Shido	Rinne's pretty late... Hmm?	
Message	Shido	Wha―?! What the?!	
Message	Shido	What is this?! Huh?	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Shido	Th-That was...!	
Message	Shido	Y-You're... from my dream...?!	
Message	???	Yes... You and I were sharing a dream...	
Message	Shido	Who are you?! Are you... a Spirit?	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Why are you targeting me?	
Message	???	"There is no need for you to know.
You will soon forget everything, after all..."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait! Stop!	
Message	???	"Goodbye, Shido Itsuka. Return once more to those
days. I wish you pleasant dreams next time―"	
Message	Shido	―?!	
Message	None	(A stream of massive light is heading toward me.)	
Message	None	"(I can't dodge it.
Is it all over...?)"	
Message	None	"(When I felt death approach, what passed through
my mind was―)"	
Choice		The days spent with Rinne.	
Choice		The dates I spent with everyone.	
Message	None	"(That's right. Tomorrow I'll be woken up by Rinne,
and she'll make bento... And we'll laugh together
about small things, and...)"	
Message	Shido	Uwaaaaaaah!!	
Message	None	"(Within my hazy mind, a large shock passed
through, and my consciousness faded.)"	
Message	None	"(I can't... I don't want to leave precious people
behind. I decided I would save everyone... I said
I would! For things to end here― They just can't!)"	
Message	Shido	DAMN ITTTTT!	
Message	???	...?!	
Message	Shido	H-Huh...? What...?	
Message	Kotori	"That was a close call. Jeez, don't
scare me like that!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmhmhm... You're always getting into danger.
I simply can't stand by and watch."	
Message	Yoshino	...I-I'll... protect you, Shido-san!	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right!"	
Message	Tohka	"I've never seen you before, but if you hurt Shido,
then you and I are enemies!"	
Message	Origami	Correction. Shido's enemy is my enemy.	
Message	Tohka	Ngh...!	
Message	Shido	E-Everyone...?! Kurumi, too―!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, am I just an afterthought?	
Message	Shido	No... That's not what I meant, but...	
Message	???	"How did you get here...?
There shouldn't be anyone besides me who can
interfere with Eden...!"	
Message	Tohka	"So you are behind everything, are you?
Then, let us defeat her and return to the
real world, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	W-Wait, Tohka! Could you let me talk to her?!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... She is trapping us here, is she not?
Wouldn't it be easier to defeat her here?"	
Message	Kotori	"It's like Tohka says, Shido. As long as we're
under the influence of the barrier, the threat
of the Spirits rampaging won't disappear!"	
Message	Shido	"I-I know that... but if there's even a small
possibility that she'll listen to me, I...
I don't want to give up! Please, Tohka! Kotori!"	
Message	Tohka	Hm! If you say so Shido, then it can't be helped!	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, you're so stubborn when it comes
to these things!"	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry! But I can't let things end without
knowing anything!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, please tell me! Who are you?
Why are you targeting me?"	
Message	???	"I am... the Ruler.
I am the one who controls Eden.
I am a godly existence..."	
Message	Shido	G-Godly...?	
Message	Ruler	"Correct. A god. My mission is to protect this
world, Eden, and maintain it. I must fulfill
that mission now."	
Message	Tohka	"What is this...? This terrible feeling is
getting stronger. Be careful, Shido!"	
Message	Kotori	Like I said, any more than this is too dangerous!	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait a second! You said you're the Ruler, right?
Do you know everything?!"	
Message	Shido	"T-The memories I have... Did they really happen?!
If you're really the culprit behind everything,
then tell me! Tell me the reason you must do this!"	
Message	Ruler	"Culprit...? Are you denying this?
This Eden, your paradise... Are you denying it?"	
Message	Shido	P-Paradise... Are you saying this is paradise?	
Message	Ruler	Yes. You may do whatever you wish here.	
Message	Ruler	"You can make a vow to Tohka, walk beside Kotori,
promise to stay by Origami's side, spend your
days with Yoshino, live with Kurumi, anything."	
Message	Shido	Wha―?! That's... Uh...	
Message	None	"(I don't know why I have all these memories...
But I do. I have them.)"	
Message	None	(And looking at everyone else, they too―)	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What does this mean?!
It's true that Shido and I came
to understand each other..."	
Message	Kotori	Shido chose me? This memory is...	
Message	Origami	"How strange. I feel as if Shido's
warmth is still with me."	
Message	Yoshino	I... tried my hardest... with Shido-san...	
Message	Kurumi	"Hmmhmm, Shido-san, you gave me... so many things,
didn't you?"	
Message	Shido	You all... remember...?!	
Message	None	"(But it's strange. That can't be possible, right?
Because there's only one of me.)"	
Message	None	"(Being with everyone―That's not possible.
But then, what are these memories?)"	
Message	Ruler	"What you are thinking of isn't unusual within
Eden. This paradise promises eternal happiness.
It can show you any dream; grant you any wish."	
Message	Shido	"These memories, then...
Are they all your doing, too?"	
Message	Ruler	"You could have done anything here. Everything was
allowed. Everything, except to touch the Forbidden
Fruit―the truth."	
Message	Shido	The truth...?	
Message	Ruler	"You have learned too much. You have gotten
too close. And so... I must erase you."	
Message	Shido	"But why... Why?! Are you telling me this is
what paradise is?! Targeting me, killing me...
What would that accomplish?!"	
Message	Ruler	"That is something you needn't know. You need only
be within Eden's peace. If you do, I will grant
you everything. Any wish, any future, any ending―"	
Message	Shido	What are you saying?! That's not―	
Message	Ruler	Here in this paradise, it is not fantasy.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(This should all be opaque nonsense, but I feel a
strange power in those words. It's as if I were to
keep listening, I'd end up believing... But, no!)"	
Message	Shido	"If that paradise you speak of truly existed...
Then, both good and bad things would end up
unfolding the way I'd want them to."	
Message	Shido	"But... Can you really call that a paradise?!
Can you really be satisfied with such a
superficial, convenient happiness?!"	
Message	Ruler	"Is there a problem with such a thing? People seek
happiness and dislike regrets. Even though I can
grant you what you wish, you would still deny it?"	
Message	Shido	"All my wishes coming true, that'd be great! But at
the cost of a false happiness given by an unknown
entity... I wouldn't have earned any of it myself!"	
Message	Shido	I won't accept that this is paradise!	
Message	Tohka	Shido...!	
Message	Origami	As expected, Shido. A wise thing to say.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...san!	
Message	Kurumi	My... Now you've said it.	
Message	Kotori	Hmm, so you actually understand pretty well.	
Message	Shido	Everyone...!	
Message	Ruler	"Shido Itsuka... You will deny this?
This paradise... This Eden?"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Ruler	If this world is desired by no one...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Ruler	Eden no longer fulfills its role...	
Message	Shido	Role? What is―?!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the?! I-Is it a spacequake?!	
Message	Ruler	This paradise, Eden... is crying...	
Message	Shido	What do you mean...?	
Message	Ruler	At this rate, this world will soon meet its death.	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Ruler	"The end is approaching... Think carefully, one
last time... If even then, you will deny this
world... Then... come and kill me."	
Message	Ruler	Before Eden meets its death.	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido!	
Message	Kotori	Rgh...!
