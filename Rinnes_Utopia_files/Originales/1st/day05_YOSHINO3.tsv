Message	Shido	"Yoshino is becoming an adult, huh...
Even if that's true, what can I do for
Yoshino's sake?"	
Message	None	"(I know that an answer won't come easily no matter
how much I think about it, but I can't help but
think about it.)"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Someone's coming...	
Message	Shido	Is it Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon... Let's talk... okay...?	
Message	Yoshinon	"......"	
Message	Yoshino	"Why are you... staying quiet...?
Please answer me... Please answer...!"	
Message	Yoshino	...! ...!!	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, let's stop.	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...san?	
Message	Shido	"I understand that you're worried about Yoshinon.
But even if you do that, Yoshinon won't come back."	
Message	Yoshino	I... know that. But... But...	
Message	Shido	"It's painful for me, too. It's even more
painful for you, Yoshino. I understand that...
She's your important friend, after all."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Shido	But Yoshino... Listen to me.	
Choice		I'm here for you, Yoshino.	
Choice		Let's both wait for Yoshinon.	
Choice		Just pretend she wasn't there from the beginning.	
Message	Shido	"Until Yoshinon comes back, you won't be alone,
Yoshino. I said this yesterday too, but I'm
here for you."	
Message	Yoshino	...!!	
Message	Shido	"Even with Yoshinon gone, please don't think you're
alone. You have so many friends around you that
care about you."	
Message	Yoshino	Friends...?	
Message	Shido	"That's right. Tohka, Kotori, Rinne...
Even Reine-san and Kannazuki-san...
Everyone thinks of you as important."	
Message	Shido	"We might not be a replacement for Yoshinon...
but we're always thinking about you. Yoshino...
You're not alone."	
Message	Yoshino	...Ah... Aahh...	
Message	Shido	"A little at a time. A little at a time is fine.
So you can welcome Yoshinon back with a smile...
Let's do our best... together."	
Message	Shido	Right, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes...
Thanks to you, I... feel a little braver."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino gave me the best smile she could at the
moment. Her smile seemed happy, but I also felt a
hint of loneliness as well.)"	
Message	Shido	"It might take some time.
But I'm sure Yoshinon will return to normal.
After all, Yoshinon's your friend, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	...!!	
Message	Shido	"So I'm sure that she'll return.
Until then, I'll wait with you. I promise."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...! Thank you...	
Message	None	"(As she said this, Yoshino gave the best smile she
could... She still seemed sad and worried, but she
was still able to smile somehow, in gratitude.)"	
Message	None	"(That's why, I decided... I would continue to stay
by Yoshino's side like this.)"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino... You don't have to be sad anymore.
Why don't you think instead... that Yoshinon
wasn't here to begin with?"	
Message	Yoshino	...!!	
Message	Shido	"If you keep obsessing over Yoshinon, it'll end up
breaking your heart... If that's the case, then
it's better to..."	
Message	Yoshino	Wh...Why...! Wh-Why... Why would I...?!	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Yoshino	I can't pretend... that Yoshinon was never here!!	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(What the... There's a sudden chill...
This is bad...!)"	
Message	Yoshino	Just... forget it...	
Message	Shido	Y-Yoshino...?!	
Message	Shido	Wait, Yoshino!!	
Message	None	"Did I say the wrong thing...? An unseasonable
snowfall turned into a snowstorm and covered
the city."	
Message	None	"Yoshino's sorrow could not be stopped, and the
snowstorm continued to rage ever stronger."	
Message	None	Eventually, everything froze over...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's sadness is too great. The more I talked
to her, the more pain she felt. Right now, she's
like I was long ago, when I was abandoned...)"	
Message	Shido	"At this rate, no matter what I try, it'll only be
a temporary fix. Isn't there anything I can do...?"	
Message	None	"(Even if I say it out loud, there's no way an
answer would come. There were no answers
that would help.)"	
Message	Shido	Let's... date.	
Message	None	"(In the end, I realized that was all I could do.
But even if something that small could support
Yoshino, then...)"	
Message	Shido	"It's not because she's unstable, or to prevent her
from losing control. I personally want to support
her."	
Message	Shido	"That's why tomorrow...
I'll go on a date with Yoshino...!"	
Message	Shido	Is that you, Yoshino?	
Message	Rinne	Sorry, I'm not Yoshino-chan.	
Message	Shido	"Rinne?
No, it's fine, but... What's wrong?"	
Message	Rinne	There was something I wanted to ask you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Something you wanted to ask?	
Message	Rinne	"Yes, I wanted to ask you.
Shido... You've decided, haven't you?"	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Rinne	"You decided that... You want
to support Yoshino-chan."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... I don't want to see Yoshino as she is
right now. I want her to be able to smile again."	
Message	Rinne	I see. So that's your answer, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. That's what I've decided.	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido... Can you promise me something?	
Message	Shido	Promise...? What...?	
Message	Rinne	"Promise that from now on, you'll cherish
Yoshino-chan. No matter what happens,
you won't let her go... Promise me."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you talking about?
You don't have to ask me to do that..."	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise me. That you'll only
think of Yoshino-chan... Otherwise, I'm sure that
your heart will one day distance itself from her."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Please...	
Message	Shido	"I understand... I promise.
As a man, I won't take back what I've said.
I'll... cherish Yoshino, absolutely."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... I knew you would promise me, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Haha, what do you mean by that?	
Message	Rinne	"I believe in you, Shido...
Don't forget your promise... Don't ever break it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course.	
Message	Rinne	If you break it, you won't get off easy, okay?	
Message	Shido	I-I know!	
Message	Rinne	I see... Then it's good.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it? Why do you have to threaten me?	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	But...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	"You'll be fine.
If it's you, you'll be fine... I'm sure of it."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What was that just now?!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne... Did you just see―	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Rinne's gone?
When did she...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is pretty late...
I should head to bed as well."	
Message	???	"...In this dream... no one can become happy...
Shido Itsuka... I hope your next dream will be
a happy one..."
