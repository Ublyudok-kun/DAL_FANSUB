Message	Shido	"All right. I've got a date today with Yoshino.
How should I meet up with her? I could ask
Reine-san for help, or I could pick her up."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san!	
Message	Shido	...Huh? What, Yoshino? Wh-Why are you here?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I thought... I could cheer everyone on.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, makes sense. Thanks.	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yeah... I-I was just... watching from the
corner, though..."	
Message	Shido	Haha. You could've said something to us.	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	Hey there, you don't have to apologize.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino is pretty shy, after all. She's keeping\nher eye on what everyone's doing today."	
Message	Shido	Ha. Haha... I see. Thanks.	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Yoshinon	"More importantly, Shido-kun, isn't there\nsomething you'd like to say?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino was waiting a long time for you\nat the front gates, you know? Don't you\nhave something you wanna ask?"	
Message	Shido	Ahh. Umm...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ya know, that thing! You gotta ask her if she\nwants that fun thing that starts with a 'D'!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh... Ah, right. I get it. Actually, the thought
just crossed my mind."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Really?!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. In fact, your timing couldn't be better,
Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	...?	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, since you're here, let's go on a date.	
Message	Yoshino	...!!	
Message	Shido	"You're not attending school, so you don't
get out much, do you?"	
Message	Yoshino	Get out much...?	
Message	Shido	"Like, on the way home from school, eating
and playing around, or talking. Stuff like that.
Does that not sound fun?"	
Message	Yoshino	N-No... It does.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, of course. All right. If you're up for it,
Yoshino, then it's decided! Let's have a blast!"	
Message	Yoshino	Okay!	
Message	Yoshinon	"A date! It's a daaate!"	
Message	Shido	"Now, then. Yoshino, do you wanna eat?
Or we can play some games at the arcade?"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Ummm...	
Message	Shido	"There are plenty of other places, too. We
could go shopping. I mean, I'm a little short
on cash, so nothing too expensive, but..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kuuuun! You shouldn't rush a lady!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to. Yoshino, please
take your time and decide."	
Message	Yoshino	Ah, y-yes. Thank you.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh boy. Yoshino, I'm pretty excited.\nWhat should we do? Hey, whaddya think?!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, hey. Now you're the one rushing her,
aren't you, Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshinon's fine! Right, Yoshino!"	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon is always like this...	
Message	Yoshinon	"So many people! It's so lively! Look\nat all the different shops!"	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'd like... to try eating that...	
Message	Shido	That...? Oh, an ice pop, huh?	
Message	Yoshino	Ice... pop?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, it's like frozen juice on a stick. Kinda
hard to explain, I guess. For now, why don't
you try it for yourself?"	
Message	Yoshino	Okay...	
Message	Shido	"All right, I'll buy one. Yoshino, what flavor
would you like?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... U-Um, well...	
Message	Shido	What's wrong...?	
Message	Yoshino	Um, I-I want to try...	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino, use your outside voice, or Shido-kun\nwon't be able to hear you."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I... I'd like to try and order—"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ooooh! Yoshino, so energetic!"	
Message	Shido	I-I don't mind, but why all of a sudden?	
Message	Yoshino	"I think I need to be more active... so
that I don't cause you any trouble."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, it seems less like a date and more like\na guardian taking a child out, huh?"	
Message	Shido	"...Got it. Well, I wouldn't mind being a
guardian, but..."	
Message	Yoshino	I don't... want that...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ah geez, you still don't get it, do you\nShido-kun? You've still got so much to learn."	
Message	Shido	I-Is that so...? I'm sorry.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino is working up the courage to enter\na shop all by herself! Show some support,\nwhy don't you?!"	
Message	Shido	You're right...	
Choice		Experience is everything. Cheer her on.	
Choice		It's still worrying. Buy them yourself.	
Message	Shido	"All right! Go ahead! Experience is
everything after all! If that's what you
want, then I'll cheer you on!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Just don't run off with any strangers!
After you buy it, come right back here!"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Haha, Shido-kun. You're such a helicopter\nparent."	
Message	Shido	No, I'm still worried... I'll come with.	
Message	Yoshino	Wha? B-But...	
Message	Shido	"I thought that maybe going together would
keep you from being overwhelmed. Do you
disagree?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Tsk tsk, this is textbook bad parenting,\nShido-kun."	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Listen, Shido-kun. Right now, Yoshino is trying\nto buy something by herself, right?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"If you joined her, wouldn't that sap Yoshino's\nconfidence?"	
Message	Shido	U-Urgh...	
Message	None	"(The puppet's right. Yoshinon's got a good
point.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Wouldn't it be better to respect Yoshino's\nwishes, and perhaps watch warmly from the\nback?"	
Message	Shido	"Ugh. Y-You're right. I... was wrong. All right,
Yoshino. Don't worry about me. Go ahead!
I'll keep an eye out from back here!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes!	
Message	Yoshino	All right... I'll go...!	
Message	Shido	R-Right... D-Do your best, Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	Okay...!	
Message	Yoshino	*deep breath, deep breath*...	
Message	Yoshinon	"You can do it, Yo～shi～no～!"	
Message	None	(Do your best, Yoshino...!)	
Message	Kotori	"Look at you... Seems like you're getting\nalong."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kotori. I'm surprised. Yoshino's really
coming into her own."	
Message	Kotori	"You're right. She's changed quite a bit.\nJust don't push her, got it? If anything\nhappens, you'd better support her."	
Message	Shido	I know.	
Message	Kotori	"Then that's settled. Okay, do your best\nout there."	
Message	Shido	Right. See ya.	
Message	Clerk	Welcome! May I take your order?	
Message	Yoshino	...! U-Um... E-Excuse me!	
Message	Clerk	Yes, how may I help you?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm... I-I'd like an ice pop...	
Message	Clerk	Of course. What flavor would you like?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm... A-Any recommendations...?	
Message	Clerk	"Yes. Today, the tropical banana is quite
popular!"	
Message	Yoshino	Um, one of those, please...	
Message	Clerk	Okay, one tropical banana, coming up!	
Message	None	(Ohh, Yoshino... You did it!)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Way to go, Yoshino! You ordered all by\nyourself!"	
Message	Yoshino	...Yeah!	
Message	Clerk	Is there anything else you'd like to order?	
Message	Yoshino	...Huh? ...Huh?	
Message	Clerk	"If you have someone with you, I'd recommend
our summer special, which is limited."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm...	
Message	Clerk	"Also, our pineapple fruit mix has been
popular as well."	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm... Aah...	
Message	None	(Oh dear...)	
Message	Clerk	Thank you very much!	
Message	Shido	Ahh... Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm... W-Well...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Uh oh, we maaay have bought too many."	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Shido	"No, it's all right. You did your best, Yoshino.
Good job."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Shido	"Well, it doesn't look like one person could
eat all of this..."	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	"For now, since you bought it and everything,
why don't we eat it before it melts?"	
Message	Yoshino	...Y-You're right.	
Message	Shido	Hey, sure looks good!	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...!	
Message	Shido	Oooh... It's cold and delicious!	
Message	Yoshino	Yesh... Ish very ghood...	
Message	Shido	"Sometimes if you eat ice pops, you can get
brain freeze, so watch out, okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yesh...	
Message	Shido	Here. This one looks good, too.	
Message	Yoshino	Ohkay!	
Message	Yoshino	I-It's starting to get difficult...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Keep going, Yoshino! Ice is your field of\nspecialty, so it'll work out!"	
Message	Shido	"Ahh, this one's melting, too! Gotta hurry and
eat it!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeshf!!	
Message	Shido	Whew. We managed to eat them all somehow...	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah... It was hard...	
Message	Shido	O-Oogh!	
Message	Yoshino	A-Are you, okay?	
Message	Shido	"M-My head... I ate too many cold things at once.
I've got an intense headache all of a sudden..."	
Message	Yoshino	A-Are you okay?	
Message	Yoshinon	"This is an emergency, Yoshino! We have to\n do something, or Shido-kun's in a jam!"	
Message	Yoshino	U-Ummm... Umm... Oh!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oooh, did you think of something?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yah...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Bwah?!"	
Message	Shido	"(Hmm, huh? For some reason, the side of
my head is warm...)"	
Message	Shido	U-Umm... Yoshino? What is...?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I thought I could... warm up your head.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hee hee, Yoshino's warm, isn't sheeee?"	
Message	Shido	Umm... Y-Yeah... Thanks. So warm.	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah. I'm glad I can... be of help.	
Message	Shido	"I guess it's hazardous to eat too many
cold things at once."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah... I'll be careful, too...	
Message	Shido	But, it was delicious.	
Message	Yoshino	Yes... it was!	
Message	Shido	All right, let's head home.	
Message	Yoshino	...Yeah.	
Message	Shido	"By the way, do you know about the
Neo Tengu Tower, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	Neo Tengu... Tower...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's got a somewhat strange design.
It's taller than the Tengu Tower, and lately
it's been noted for being a symbol of the city."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yahooo! That sounds super interesting!\nIt'd be neat to climb it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'd like to check it out, too.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Okie dokes. Let's go, let's go!"	
Message	Shido	Go... You mean, right now?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah! Tall skyscrapers are practically\nasking to be climbed, aren't they?! Am\nI wrong? Whaddya think, Shido-kun?!"	
Message	Shido	"I understand how you feel, but...
I don't think it's open yet..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Shido-kun. If you keep sweating the details,\nyou'll never be popular!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, that's none of your business! Well,
I'm unsure if we're allowed inside, but
we can stop by on our way home."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, what do you want to do?	
Message	Yoshino	Let's... go!	
Message	Shido	All right. Then let's stop by for a bit.	
Message	Shido	"This is Neo Tengu Tower...
Just as I guessed, it looks closed."	
Message	Yoshinon	"It's sooo biiiig! I wanna reach the top so\nbadly! It's a shame we can't climb it!"	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes, it's tall.	
Message	Shido	"If we can't go inside, then there's no point in
being here, so we should just head home.
Let's come back again when it's open."	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah...	
Message	Yoshinon	"You promise, right?"	
Message	Shido	Yup. It's a promise.
