Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Tohka	"Did you... refuse to eat my bento... because
I am a poor cook?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No! I-It's not like that. You see, I have
my reasons..."	
Message	None	"(I was honest, and I told Tohka about
Rinne's bento...)"	
Message	Shido	"That's why I thought if I chose one bento
over the other, I would hurt the other person."	
Message	Shido	"Because I couldn't come up with a way not
to hurt either of you, I ran away..."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, I see. I feel relief now that I understand
your reasoning. Shido... I forgot you were
like that."	
Message	Shido	"I know you worked so hard to make this,
Tohka. I'm sorry that I didn't eat it."

Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Tohka	"I know that I may not be as good as Rinne,
but... would you eat my bento someday...
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I'd love to eat anything you made for
me, Tohka. Actually, today's bento... I can
eat it after school."	
Message	Tohka	"No... You took way too long to come back, so...
I ate it myself. Sorry."	
Message	Shido	No, it's fine. It's all my fault.	
Message	Rinne	Shido, you're back.	
Message	Shido	Oh Rinne! Um... Er...	
Message	Rinne	*giggle* I know, it's okay.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	"I heard that Tohka-chan made bento for
lunch today. I made one too, which made
for a predicament, right...?"	
Message	Shido	You see right through me... Sorry Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"Don't worry about me. You have to be the
kind of person you want to meet."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...
