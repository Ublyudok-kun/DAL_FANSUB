Message	None	"(All right! I'm gonna eat Tohka's lunch. I'm
sure Rinne would understand.)"	
Message	Shido	"Thanks, Tohka. You took the time to make
lunch, so I'm gonna dig in."	
Message	Tohka	"Okay! Don't hold back. If you like it, I can
make it every day."	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. Well, then you'd be pushing yourself
too hard..."	
Message	Tohka	Hey?! How do you know that?!	
Message	None	"(Well, if you're sleeping in that much, then
it's not too hard to figure out...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Don't tell me! You hired a spy to observe me,
didn't you?!"	
Message	Shido	"I didn't hire a spy, nor was I observing you,
so don't worry. You just looked sleepy, so I
figured it was the case."	
Message	Tohka	Oh... I-I see.	
Message	Shido	Anyways, let's grub. Can you give me a moment?	
Message	Tohka	Sure. What's wrong?	
Message	Shido	Nothing, I need to talk to Rinne.	
Message	Tohka	I see. Hurry up then.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	(But... it's hard for me to bring it up.)	
Message	Rinne	Shido?	
Message	None	—?! R-Rinne!	
Message	Shido	U-Um! Rinne, you see...	
Message	Rinne	Don't look so troubled.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan brought lunch, right?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, so today—	
Message	Rinne	"Okay... It's fine. Don't worry about me. You
should hurry off to her."	
Message	Shido	B-But...	
Message	Rinne	"Don't tell Tohka-chan I made lunch, okay?
I don't want her to feel bad..."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. Don't worry about it. Be sure to eat it
all though, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Got it!	
Message	Tohka	Shido, you done?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Let's move and start eating.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Will this place suffice?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, I'm eating the lunch you made, so it's
just the two of us, right?"	
Message	None	"(If I eat Tohka's lunch here, God knows what
anyone would say. I feel bad eating it in front
of Rinne, too...)"	
Message	Tohka	"I-I see. If you give the word, I will go wherever
you need me to."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Let's get going then.	
Message	Tohka	Okay!	
Message	None	"(Phew. It's hot, but we're in the shade, so it
should be fine. Finally, I can eat in peace.)"	
Message	Shido	Let's eat here then.	
Message	Tohka	It may not compare to Rinne's cooking, but...	
Message	Shido	"I'm just happy to eat something you made,
Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	I-I see.	
Message	Shido	Thanks for the meal.	
Message	Tohka	Go on then.	
Message	Shido	Let's see...	
Message	None	"(There's rice, stewed potatoes and beef...
some sausage and pickles. Oh, and there are
some apple wedges, too.)"	
Message	Shido	"I see. Rinne's showed you how to make meat
and potatoes?"	
Message	Shido	"*nom, nom*... OH! Tohka, this is delicious!
Great job!"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really?! Then try the others!	
Message	None	"(And so, I devoured the entire lunch she had
prepared for me.)"	
Message	None	"(The potato and carrots were diced rather
oddly, but it added to the charm of the meal.)"	
Message	None	"(The sausage was cut like tiny octopuses, but
the cuts were so deep, they were practically
starfish. Lots of salt and pepper used, too.)"	
Message	None	"(There were other peculiarities, but I could
tell that Rinne had taught Tohka well. The
meal was made with lots and lots of love.)"	
Message	Shido	"Thanks so much for lunch! Everything was
delicious!"	
Message	Tohka	"Mm... Th-Then, would you like me to do so
again tomorrow?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I appreciate the gesture, but I wouldn't
want to take you away from your studies. It's
almost time for testing, so maybe after."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, very well. Then, let me know when you'd
like me to resume, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Sure, got it. Anyways, where's your lunch?	
Message	Tohka	Mine...?	
Message	Tohka	"OH! I was so busy preparing your meal that
I forgot to make my own."	
Message	Shido	WHAT?!	
Message	Tohka	Awww. My stomach...	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you gonna do?! We gotta hurry
before lunchtime's over—OH!"	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What's the matter...?	
Message	Shido	There is! I have a lunch for you, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Let's hit the classroom, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	O-Okay.	
Message	Rinne	Here you go, Tohka-chan.	
Message	Tohka	WOOAH! MY LUNCH?!	
Message	Tohka	Thank you so much, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. You're welcome.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? The portions look large enough for two, eh?	
Message	Rinne	"Oh. You see, I made too much food in a rush.
Right, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Tohka	So I can eat it all?	
Message	Rinne	"It'd be nice if you could, but don't force it,
okay?"	
Message	Tohka	Okay! Leave it to me!	
Message	Rinne	Go on ahead.	
Message	Shido	Rinne. Um, thanks for everything.	
Message	Rinne	"No problem. I'm pleased the lunch didn't
go to waste."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. We're lucky to have you.	
Message	Rinne	Why, you won't get anything for praising me.	
Message	None	(No, you've given enough.)
