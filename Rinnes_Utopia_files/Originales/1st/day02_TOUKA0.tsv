Message	Tonomachi	"Oooh, they're going at it!
Just when Tohka-chan's out there, too!
It was the right choice to choose tennis, huh Itsuka!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ah maaan!
Tohka-chan's super cute!!"	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi, you're ditching in order to be here, so cheer properly.	
Message	Tohka	Hrngh!	
Message	Shido	"Tohka... For someone who claims not to be good at
tennis, she's doing pretty well."	
Message	None	"(Tohka's reflexes are amazing, so I suppose
it makes sense.)"	
Message	Tohka	Hah!	
Message	Referee	Deuce!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh? Tohka-chan's caught up!
I'm kinda getting really excited!"	
Message	Shido	It looks like she's slowly learning the ropes.	
Message	Tonomachi	Kyaaa! Tohka-chwaaaan! You're amaziiiiing!	
Message	None	"(Can't Tonomachi cheer more normally...?
Jeez, this guy...)"	
Message	None	(Still... I wonder why. Tohka's really dazzling for some reason.)	
Message	None	"(Tohka's so dignified and beautiful while earnestly chasing the ball...
It's not an exaggeration to say it's like a work of art.)"	
Message	Ai	――Huh, if it isn't Tonomachi-kun and Itsuka-kun?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Are you here to cheer Tohka on too?	
Message	Mai	"Huh, the two of you cheering together so chummy and such,
is that rumor about you going out with Tonomachi-kun true?"	
Message	Mii	That's so gross.	
Message	Shido	"Hey! Don't spread weird rumors like that!
Where the hell did that information come from!?"	
Message	Tonomachi	I won't deny anything.	
Message	Shido	No, deny it!	
Message	Ai	"――Oh, wait a second!
Then what would happen to Tohka!?"	
Message	Mai	"It would be too cruel of an outcome for her to have
her lover stolen by the dual-wielding Tonomachi-kun."	
Message	Mii	No, if she got rid of one of them, the ending could still be changed...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Ai	"In any case, you're pretending to be sick, so shouldn't
you not be cheering at a time like this?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hm? Wait, what? What do you mean?
Is it spring? Has spring finally come for me...?"	
Message	Mai	"Why don't you leave cheering Tohka-chan to Itsuka-kun,
and come to the back of the school building with us?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ohhh!? So finally, my time to be popular has arrived!
Ha ha ha, I'm getting embarrassed!"	
Message	Mii	It looks like this guy wants the "method" where no bones'll remain.	
Message	Tonomachi	Hm? That's a pretty aggressive method of courting.	
Message	Ai	Whatever, just shut up and follow us.	
Message	Tonomachi	Right right! See ya Itsuka! I'll be gone for a bit!	
Message	None	"(Tonomachi...I hope you're happy until the very end.
I won't recover your bones.)"	
Message	Ai	"Itsuka-kun...if you take your eyes off Tohka-chan for even a second,
you won't get off with just being paraded around the city, you got it?"	
Message	Mai	"If you betray Tohka-chan, you will definitely be crucified
and tortured, alright?"	
Message	Mii	"When it comes to that, we won't kill you easily.
To start things off, we'll prepare a triangle stool and an iron maiden."	
Message	Ai	That's how it is, so cheer Tohka-chan on!	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	(Umm...yeah! Just gonna get back into things and cheer!)	
Message	None	"(Huh? Tohka's suddenly got the advantage!
...Which means, if she gets one more point, she can turn it around?)"	
Message	None	"(Just one more ball, if a weak ball comes that's the chance, but...
Wait, just as I was saying it, an easy ball!?)"	
Message	None	"(――A ball with the best trajectory is heading
where Tohka is waiting!)"	
Message	Shido	TohkaAA!! GOOOOOOOOO!!!!	
Message	Tohka	Teeei!!	
Message	Referee	O-Out...!?	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm...?
Was I not supposed to knock it far upwards in this instance?
I saw it somewhere once before, but..."	
Message	Shido	I-It would have been better for Tohka to do softball...
