Message	Shido	Kannazuki-san...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Well, if it isn't Shido-kun. Do you have business
on the Fraxinus?"	
Message	None	"(B-Business... I'd like to take a good hour to
grill him on just who teleported me here of their
own accord! ...But that can wait for now.)"	
Message	Shido	"I just thought I'd ask about the current
situation... Is Kotori here?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"No, the commander is currently away from her
chair. If you are all right with me, I can answer
your questions."	
Message	Shido	Um. Then, Kannazuki-san, what are you doing?	
Message	Kannazuki	I am currently in the middle of a simulation...	
Message	Shido	"A simulation...? Just now, I thought I saw a girl
wearing frilly clothes in the middle of your
monitor, but..."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Hahaha, how ridiculous, Shido-kun. It's merely
an optical illusion..."	
Message	Shido	...I see, I'll pretend I didn't see that.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kannazuki-san?	
Message	Kannazuki	Oh, Shido-kun. Out shopping as well?	
Message	Shido	"Well, yeah. Are you running errands,
Kannazuki-san?"	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, I'm replenishing necessary supplies.	
Message	Shido	"Huh, I thought replenishment would be more
systematized. I didn't think you'd be shopping
so close-by..."	
Message	Kannazuki	"The majority of goods are supplied via Ratatoskr,
but there are some items I simply have to
purchase on my own."	
Message	Shido	Like what...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"This, of course! A limited-edition first print of
the new romance game, ""School Detective Club
Scanties,"" just released today!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see...	
Message	Kannazuki	"In particular, with the shop's limited clear
folder illustrations, it's quite possible that
I wouldn't be able to pick this up after today!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Oh, how careless of me! If I waste time, the
line will only grow longer! Now then, Shido-kun,
I'll be taking my leave!"	
Message	Shido	...*sigh* Good luck.	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Huh? This place is...	
Message	Kannazuki	Why hello, Shido-kun.	
Message	Shido	"I-I knew it, it's Kannazuki-san. What on earth
is this guy thinking, summoning me to the
Fraxinus without warning...?"	
Message	Shido	"Hm? What are you doing? Everyone's
gathered here."	
Message	Kannazuki	Well, we were all just having a little bet...	
Message	Shido	A bet...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes, on what pattern the commander's
underwear is today..."	
Message	Shido	"Gah! What do you think you're doing, making
another person's younger sister a target of a
bet?!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Intuition tells me she's wearing a striped
pattern, but... Shido-kun, as her brother,
what is your guess?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't care! First of all, even if you are
making a bet, how the hell do you plan
on proving it?!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Of course, the hero will honorably put his
life on the line for everyone's sake..."	
Message	Shido	You wouldn't come back alive, you know?	
Message	Kannazuki	...What a blessing that would be!	
Message	Shido	It's no use. This guy's hopeless.	
Message	Shido	"...Huh, Kannazuki-san? Not often that I run
into you on the ground."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Oh, Shido-kun. Actually, there was an urgent call
from the commander..."	
Message	Shido	"Kotori doesn't seem to be back yet. You'd
probably meet her if you waited on the Fraxinus?"	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, I suppose that is true...	
Message	Kannazuki	...	
Message	Shido	...Is something wrong?	
Message	Kannazuki	"The commander's room is located in this house,
correct?"	
Message	Shido	Well, yeah. That's pretty obvious, I think...	
Message	Kannazuki	Would you allow me to peek inside a little?	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you saying?!
Of course you can't!"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Please, could you let it slide? It's simply a
natural thing for the vice commander to
understand the commander's regular lifestyle!"	
Message	Shido	I said no way! Just go back already!	
Message	Kannazuki	Shido-kun, how unkind...	
Message	Shido	Why am I surrounded by these sorts of people?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	None	(Rgh! This is Kannazuki-san's doing, isn't it?!)	
Message	Shido	Hmm, does the bridge seem a little noisy?	
Message	Shido	Kannazuki-san, what's wrong?	
Message	Kannazuki	Ahh, Shido-kun... There's been a little incident.	
Message	Shido	An incident...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes, in regards to the tower that has been
newly built within Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you mean the Neo Tengu Tower...	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes, actually. Last night, I was investigating the
records of that tower, but something's amiss."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What did you find?!	
Message	Kannazuki	No, it's just the opposite.	
Message	Shido	Excuse me...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Within the Fraxinus' computer, data not only
on Tengu City, but on structures worldwide
exist. But records of the Neo Tengu Tower do not."	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! Is it because it's just been built, so
they may've forgotten to enter the record,
or something like that?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"At first, I suspected that too. However, it's
not possible that we would make such a simple
mistake..."	
Message	None	"(Hmmm, I wonder. Now that he says that,
I have a hazy feeling that they might...)"	
Message	Kannazuki	If I were to hazard a guess...	
Message	Shido	A guess?	
Message	Kannazuki	"There was a time when I may have gotten too
excited when editing a photo of the commander, and
spilled coffee on the console. But I'm unsure."	
Message	Shido	"That's suspicious to me! Besides, why the hell
were you editing pictures?!"	
Message	Kannazuki	Ah ha ha. It was nothing fancy.	
Message	Shido	That's not the issue here!	
Message	Kannazuki	"Well, I will show them to you another time.
Please look forward to it."	
Message	Shido	No, thank you...
