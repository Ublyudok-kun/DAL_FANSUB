Message	Shido	―Ow!	
Message	Rinne	Shido! What's wrong?!	
Message	Shido	I-I'm okay... Just sore muscles.	
Message	Rinne	"I see, thank goodness.
I'll bring a compress, so sit down."	
Message	Shido	All right... Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	Here, it should be okay now.	
Message	Shido	Ah, thank you.	
Message	Rinne	"Are you okay? You were in a deep sleep, and
then you tried to go to Takadai Park..."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, yeah. It's just as you say...
Oh, that's right..."	
Message	Shido	Rinne, have you ever gone to the top?	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Um... I got lost halfway and turned back
around. Ahaha... but sometimes I think about
seeing the view from up there."	
Message	Shido	"Huh, I see. I know how you feel. Being able to
look down at the entire city is... I guess it's
kinda nice."	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. To be able to see what the city we live
in looks like. I like that thought."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, but Rinne? It's probably best that you don't
go near there for a while."	
Message	Rinne	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	Well you see, um, it's not normal, and...	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, if you're talking about sore muscles, I'm
all trained up from lacrosse, so it's fine."	
Message	Shido	No, that's not what I mean...	
Message	None	"(How do I explain it to her? The only way
to put it is that it's... strange.)"	
Message	Rinne	"You don't have to worry, Shido. It seems like we
won't be able to go there for a while anyway."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Rinne	"We can still go to Takadai Park, but the viewing
point past it will be under reconstruction,
so it'll be off-limits for a while."	
Message	Shido	Really?!	
Message	Rinne	"Seems like it... Oh, there―on the news. Isn't that
what they're talking about?"	
Message	Newscaster	"Construction of the viewing platform began\nearlier today; a result of City efforts to prevent\nany accidents caused by falling off of the..."	
Message	Shido	Today...?!	
Message	None	"(It was too much of a coincidence. The TV
practically echoed what Rinne said just now.)"	
Message	None	"(The mayor of Tengu City was shown on screen
speaking to a crowd of residents in front of the
train station.)"	
Message	Shido	"There weren't any signs that they'd be doing
construction up there."	
Message	Rinne	"That's not true. They had it fenced
off and everything."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Really?	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. Not as many people visit because the view's
obstructed. I guess the view itself will change
from now on."	
Message	Rinne	"You should watch local news once in a while. They
talk about some pretty important things that end
up being useful information."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you're right. I'll be careful from now on.	
Message	Rinne	"But it's kind of a shame that we can't go up
there... Yesterday you wanted to take Tohka there,
right?"	
Message	Shido	"Umm, yeah. I thought we could go see the
whole city together."	
Message	Rinne	I see...	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's not like we'll never
be able to go again..."	
Message	Rinne	"But... If that were the case...
What would you do, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	What would I do...? Would that even be possible?	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, I'm just kidding. I'm sure there's no way
that would happen."	
Message	Shido	Yeah...
