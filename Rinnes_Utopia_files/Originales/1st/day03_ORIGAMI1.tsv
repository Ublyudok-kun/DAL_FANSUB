Message	None	"(Where did Origami go? Once homeroom was
over, before I knew it, she was gone...)"	
Message	None	"(Tama-chan told us about the AST, so
maybe she got worried and headed back
to base.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey. Is that Origami over there with our
teacher?"	
Message	Shido	What are they talking about...?	
Message	Tamae	"I apologize for bringing this up out of the
blue, but please consider it."	
Message	Origami	Okay.	
Message	Tamae	Get home safely, okay?	
Message	Origami	Okay...	
Message	None	(Oh. Is Origami going somewhere?)	
Choice		Call out to her.	
Choice		Follow her.	
Message	Shido	Origami!	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	What were you talking to Tama-chan about?	
Message	Origami	About the choir club.	
Message	Shido	C-Choir?! You're in choir club?	
Message	Origami	"No, I haven't joined yet, but they want me to
join after testing. I guess someone backed out
and asked if I could sub for them."	
Message	Shido	I-I see, but why you, Origami?	
Message	Origami	"I'm unsure. Supposedly, the teacher in charge of
the choir club had asked Okamine-sensei. Perhaps
she thought I could."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, I knew that Origami was
both a talented student and an athlete. I
wonder how she'd fare at music.)"	
Message	Shido	What do you plan on doing then, Origami?	
Message	Origami	"All I said was I'll consider it. I can sing
according to the notes. What do you think,
Shido?"	
Choice		Give it a shot.	
Choice		Don't push yourself.	
Message	Shido	"Wow, that's amazing. I couldn't sing just from
looking at a sheet of music. If it's your thing,
then give it a shot. I want to hear, too."	
Message	Origami	Really? If you say so, Shido. I'll do it.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Origami	"Well, I'll tell Okamine-sensei that I'll join
then."	
Message	Shido	Okay. G-Good luck.	
Message	Origami	I'll try.	
Message	None	"(There's no limit to what you can do, huh
Origami? Man, how many talents do you
have?)"	
Message	Shido	"It's up to you whether you want to join, but
just because you can"" doesn't mean you have
to accept everything that comes your way."""	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"If you don't want to, you can say no; you don't
have to force yourself. I mean... You already
have enough on your plate with the AST right?"	
Message	Origami	You have a point...	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, I understand if there's no one else,
but I think you have the right to say no if
you don't want to."	
Message	Origami	If you say so, Shido, I'll do that.	
Message	Shido	What... O-Oh...	
Message	Origami	Then I'll go tell Okamine-sensei that.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Origami	Thanks.	
Message	None	(Huh...? I wonder if she wanted to do it...)	
Message	None	"(But... just because Origami can take on
everything doesn't mean her body will last.)"	
Message	None	(Man, how in the world is Origami so talented?)	
Message	None	"(Huh? It doesn't seem like she's going home.
I'm curious. Maybe I should follow her.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder why Origami's up on the rooftop.
What is she doing here?)"	
Message	Origami	Ave Maria, gratia plena; Dominus tecum.	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Origami	...Who's there?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, s-sorry! I wasn't trying to snoop around,
but..."	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	You were really good. I was so surprised.	
Message	Origami	"I can only sing according to the notes. I'm
not that great."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really? I didn't see it like that. Why were
you singing all of a sudden, though?"	
Message	Origami	Okamine-sensei asked me to.	
Message	Shido	"Is that what you and she were talking
about earlier?"	
Message	Origami	"Supposedly, the choir club has a concert
after testing's over. Someone couldn't make
it, so Okamine-sensei asked if I could cover."	
Message	Shido	But why'd she ask you of all people?	
Message	Origami	"I don't know the details. Maybe she thought
I could handle the pressure. I just told her
that I would consider it."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Man, being a genius at everything
must be tough when everyone's depending
on you..."	
Message	Origami	"Shido, have you been following me since
I spoke with our teacher?"	
Message	Shido	What?! Well, I wasn't tailing you or anything!	
Message	Origami	I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	Huh... Wh-What do you mean by that?	
Message	Origami	Don't mind me.	
Message	None	(...But I'm totally curious.)	
Message	Origami	Shido, what do you think?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	About the choir club.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. It's up to you, isn't it? Just because you
are able to balance every task in the world
doesn't necessarily mean you should."	
Message	Origami	Butâ€”?	
Message	Shido	"Hearing you sing just now... I can't help but
hope that you'll take on the challenge."	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	"Even acapella... I'm mesmerized that you
can sing without any instruments. So long
as it's your voice, I want to listen."	
Message	Origami	Okay. If you say so, Shido.	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Origami	I'm going to tell Okamine-sensei.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, gotcha. G-Good luck.	
Message	Origami	I'll try.	
Message	None	(...Is there anything Origami can't do?)
