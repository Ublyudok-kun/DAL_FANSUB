Message	Shido	I thought I'd find her here, but...	
Message	Shido	Seems like Kurumi isn't here.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well. Nothing I can do then. I guess I
could try looking somewhere else."	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? Did Tohka and Origami go home
already?"	
Message	Shido	Man, guess that means no date for me today.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	"We're out of milk and eggs, so maybe I can
drop by the market then head home."	
Message	Shido	So, where's the milk... Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Wait...? Did I...	
Message	Shido	Yeah... It's Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kurumi... What are you doing here?	
Message	Shido	...Hey?!	
Message	Shido	Wait...? Is she avoiding me...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's not like we're close, but that kind
of hurts..."	
Message	Shido	"Hm. I don't see the point in running after
her, either. I guess I'll finish shopping first."	
Message	Shido	All right. All that's left to get are eggs.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	"Wait, she's not avoiding me. Is she stalking
me...? What's her deal?"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	Aah!	
Message	Kurumi	"That's so mean. Why are you screaming
out of the blue?"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you...	
Message	Shido	But... you've been stalking me, haven't you?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, what are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	Uh... it's totally obvious.	
Message	Kurumi	Well, I suppose, huh?	
Message	Shido	So you are?! Why would you do that...?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... Call it curiosity.	
Message	Shido	Curiosity?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. I've always wanted to do it. I figured
even if you caught me, Shido-san, you'd
forgive me."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that might be true, but... more than that,
here."	
Message	Kurumi	What's with the hand?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't like how you're still on the
floor. Especially since—um, I don't know
where to move my eyes."	
Message	Kurumi	Huh?	
Message	Shido	...Your skirt's lifted up.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. Right you are. Hehe, Shido-san,
you're staring. Boys will be boys."	
Message	Shido	NONONONONONO?!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh...? Why the long face? Want to see more?	
Message	Shido	I-I didn't mean it like that...	
Message	Kurumi	Heheh. I was only kidding. Very well. Good day.	
Message	Shido	Oh... H-Hey, Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	...What was that all about?
