Message	None	(Ah. Coming here is so relaxing.)	
Message	None	(Origami... I wonder what she's up to.)	
Message	None	"(I still can't get the image of Origami punching
the wall of the outlet tower out of my head.)"	
Message	None	"(I never want to see her like that again. I wish
Origami could be more...)"	
Message	???	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! O-Origami?! Wh-What are you doing
here?!"	
Message	Origami	Rinne Sonogami told me you would be here.	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne said that...?	
Message	Origami	Yes.	
Message	None	"(Did I ever tell Rinne that I go here? Oh well.
Now's not the time to worry about that...!)"	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Origami	"Be honest with me. What were you thinking
just now?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean? Well...	
Choice		About you, Origami.	
Choice		Play it off.	
Message	Shido	I-I was thinking about you, Origami.	
Message	Origami	...Why?	
Message	Shido	"What do you mean? I was... Um...
I was just thinking about how I'd like to see
your smile."	
Message	Origami	Well, I...	
Message	Shido	"I know. It's not like I don't know the burden
on you. All things considered, it's no easy task."	
Message	Shido	"Even so, I don't want you to give up. I just
want to see you smile. That's all."	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"When I first invited you on dates, I did have
ulterior motives."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"If you were to leave AST, then I didn't know
what you'd do, so..."	
Message	Shido	"I figured that being with me would alleviate
your anxiety. That's why I decided to invite
you out. Sorry."	
Message	Origami	I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"If I get to date you, the circumstances of how
are unimportant."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	None	(Origami is amazing...)	
Message	Shido	"Oh! But now, I genuinely... I genuinely want
you to smile."	
Message	Origami	"I cannot promise you I can. Not until my
mission is complete."	
Message	Shido	Sure. I understand. I still won't give up.	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Origami, will you go on a date with me tomorrow,
too?"	
Message	Origami	No problem. Dates with you are my top priority.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... Then let's meet at the plaza in front
of the station tomorrow."	
Message	Origami	Roger. I look forward to it.	
Message	Shido	Oh!	
Message	Shido	U-Um, uh...	
Message	None	"(I can't tell her I was thinking about her.
That'd be too embarrassing.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	None	(I-I need to play it off somehow—!)	
Message	Shido	U-Uh, I was thinking about Rinne!	
Message	Origami	I knew it... Rinne Sonogami, huh?	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"From the beginning, I knew she'd be a powerful
enemy."	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Um... O-Origami-san? What are you
talking abou—"	
Message	Origami	"That's unfortunate. It was the answer I hadn't
hoped to hear. It's all over."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"Today, I was notified of an official dishonorable
discharge from the AST."	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Origami	"Now, not only can I not defeat the Spirits,
but now Shido has been taken from me."	
Message	Shido	No... Taken from you? That's a misund—	
Message	Origami	There's no reason to live. Good-bye, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, wait! Origami! Where are you going?!
ORIGAMI?!"	
Message	None	"(I sprinted after Origami, but no matter what
I said, she wouldn't listen.)"	
Message	None	"(I assumed she would speak to me once the shock
of being dismissed had settled, so I decided to
leave her alone.)"	
Message	None	"(But ever since that day, Origami disappeared.
She stopped showing up to class and moved
away.)"	
Message	None	(Origami had totally vanished.)	
Message	None	"(That day, if I never felt shy, and had told her
how I really felt, maybe Origami would've
chosen another path...)"	
Message	None	"(I choked up, dizzy from sadness...
It wasn't supposed to be this way!)"	
Message	None	"(I became a recluse, and I shut myself off
from everyone. I don't want to think anymore.
I don't want to feel anymore.)"	
Message	None	(I'm tired of living...)	
Message	None	"(All right. Today's date with Origami is
important.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know what I can do to make her
smile, but I hope it happens.)"	
Message	Shido	Yes, come in.	
Message	Shido	Rinne...? Why are you up so late?	
Message	Rinne	I wanted to ask you something, Shido.	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Rinne	Yes. So, it appears that you have decided...	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Rinne	"You said that... you wanted to be there
for Tobiichi-san."	
Message	Shido	"...I do. I... I want to change Origami.
I want her to smile again."	
Message	Rinne	...I see. So that's your decision, huh Shido?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it is.	
Message	Rinne	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido. Promise me something.	
Message	Shido	Promise...? What for?	
Message	Rinne	"That you'll take good care of Tobiichi-san from
now on. No matter what happens, you won't
let her go. Promise me."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's gotten into you? You don't need
to tell me that..."	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise. Promise me
that you will think only of Tobiichi-san, or
else, your heart will drift away some day."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Please...	
Message	Shido	"Okay, I promise. Man's word. I promise... to take
good care of Origami."	
Message	Rinne	"Okay, I knew you'd make that promise with
me."	
Message	Shido	Haha, seriously? What's gotten into you?	
Message	Rinne	"I have faith in you. I trust you, Shido. Don't
forget your promise. Don't break it either, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Of course.	
Message	Rinne	If you break it, then you must pay.	
Message	Shido	I-I know.	
Message	Rinne	I see. As long as you understand.	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's the big deal? Why are you threatening
me?"	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	But...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	"You'll be fine, right? I'm sure if it's Shido,
he'll be fine."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What was that just now?!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne... Did you just see―	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Rinne's gone?
When did she...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is pretty late...
I should head to bed as well."	
Message	???	"...In this dream... no one can become happy...
Shido Itsuka... I hope your next dream will be
a happy one..."
