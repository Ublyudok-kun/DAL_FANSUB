Message	Shido	"Alright, the rice is finished so whenever
you're ready to eat, we can..."	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	Hey, what's wrong?	
Message	Yoshino	Um... I want... to help...	
Message	Shido	With what? Oh, with dinner?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah! Help, help, help!"	
Message	Shido	"Haha, you're more than welcome to help
me out. But, what should I have you
help with? I'm almost done..."	
Message	Yoshino	Ah!	
Message	Shido	"Maybe you can set the dishes on the table.
And could you bring out the silverware
from that shelf over there?"	
Message	Yoshino	Okay.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Set the dishes! Set the dishes!"	
Message	None	"(How nice of her to help me like this.
Okay, time to clean up over here...)"	
Message	Shido	Ah?! What the?!	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	A-Are you okay?!	
Message	Yoshino	I'm sorry... I broke... a plate...	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no, don't apologize!
It's not a big deal at all!"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, Yoshino's mental state is going
a little nuts. What the heck did you do?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, well... Yoshino was helping me set the
table, but she dropped a plate. It broke."	
Message	Kotori	"Ugh, you... Why are you even having
Yoshino putting away the dishes?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... but, Yoshino said she wanted
to help on her own, so..."	
Message	Kotori	"Seriously? Use that brain of yours.
She's wearing Yoshinon..."	
Message	Shido	Oh.. sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"Do you get it? The Spirits are unstable.
You have to take the utmost care not to shock them."	
Message	Shido	I-I got it... I'll be careful.	
Message	Kotori	"Careful not to aggravate Yoshino.
If you really understand... then act accordingly."	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Choice		A mistake can't be helped. Just keep comforting her.	
Choice		A miss is a miss. Just give a little warning.	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, it's alright. Try to calm down, okay?	
Message	Yoshino	I'm... so sorry... I...	
Message	Shido	"Everyone makes mistakes. I really don't care.
I just don't want to see you stress yourself
out like this."	
Message	Yoshino	"I just... I wanted to help you...
I'm so pathetic..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't beat yourself, Yoshino!\nYou tried your best and that's what counts!"	
Message	Shido	"That's right! I was just happy that
you were willing to help at all."	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Feel free to make mistakes. That's how you learn.
You just keep doing it and doing it and eventually
you get better."	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	"Don't sweat it, okay?
It's almost dinner time, to let's have a nice
meal and forget any of this happened."	
Message	Yoshino	Thank you...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ooh, nice save, Shido-kun!"	
Message	Shido	Thanks!	
Message	Shido	I think I did pretty good...	
Message	Kotori	"Not bad, Shido. Yoshino's mental state
seems to be stabilizing."	
Message	Shido	Thank goodness...	
Message	Kotori	"Listen, don't forget what just happened okay?
You do not upset the Spirits, plain and simple.
Dumbass."	
Message	Shido	G-Got it.	
Message	Shido	"Look, I'm glad you didn't get hurt,
but watch it next time."	
Message	Yoshino	I'm... sorry!	
Message	Yoshinon	Too cruel, Shido-kun! Too cruel!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino tried her hardest, you know!\nDon't you think you're being a little harsh?"	
Message	Shido	Well... sure, but next time... we have to...	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah, it's because... I did something wrong... the plate!	
Message	Shido	Hey, don't take it so seriously, okay?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino, don't let it bother you so much. It's alright!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... maybe you should take it easy for
a little while. Don't worry about it."	
Message	Yoshino	Okay... I'm really sorry...	
Message	Shido	Ugh... I could've handled that better...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you've got slugs for brains. How stupid
can you be? Are you freaking serious right now?"	
Message	Shido	Whoa! What are you talking about, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Your response just now was a total failure.
Of course your dumbass didn't notice, but
she was really upset just now."	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I wasn't thinking at all.	
Message	Kotori	"You already know the Spirits' mental states are
in your hands. Keep this up and I'll make sure
everyone on the planet knows your little secret."	
Message	Shido	I'm really sorry...
