I've seen with my own eyes...)"	
Message	None	(Control of Eden is unreliable...)	
Message	None	(Maybe it really is hopeless...)	
Message	None	"(No... It can't be! I won't accept it. My world is
not wrong!)"	
Message	None	(If my powers don't stabilize, what will I do...)	
Message	None	"(I know the answer to this... That's right.
Just like the Spirits, I can...)"	
Message	None	"(Hehe... I see... How did I not think of
this before... It appears in my haste,
I failed to consider it...)"	
Message	None	(I'm sure that... with this...)	
Message	???	Shido... It's morning... Wake up.	
Message	Shido	...Mmm... What was that just...?	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Are you awake?	
Message	Shido	Mmm. Oh... Rinne... Morning.	
Message	Rinne	"Good morning, Shido! The weather's
nice again today."	
Message	Shido	"...Did something good happen?
You seem oddly full of energy."	
Message	Rinne	Huh. Really? I don't think I am.	
Message	Shido	Is that so?	
Message	Rinne	"Really, I'm not. Oh! More importantly, Shido...
Are you free after school today?"	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Well, I suppose so...	
Message	None	(Although I'd have to take dates into account.)	
Message	Rinne	"Thank goodness! Then I'll make breakfast. Come
downstairs when you're ready."	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Message	Shido	Huh... Where is everyone?	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, right. Yoshino-chan wasn't feeling well, so
Kotori-chan took her to the hospital. I wanted to
go, but she asked me to take care of you, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino's in the hospital? Is she okay?	
Message	Rinne	"Kotori-chan said she didn't think it was anything
serious, but..."	
Message	Shido	I see... I'm still worried, though.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah...	
Message	None	"(Kotori most likely took her to the Fraxinus. If
that's the case, I'm sure she's all right, but...)"	
Message	Shido	So, what about Tohka? Is she still asleep?	
Message	Rinne	"Nope. Tohka-chan said she would go to
school first, and she's already left."	
Message	Shido	Huh?! Really?! Th-That's so unlike her!	
Message	Rinne	"I feel a little bad for Tohka-chan that you're so
surprised..."	
Message	Shido	Oh... No, I didn't mean it like that...	
Message	None	"(If something happened to Yoshino, then Tohka
might also have... No, but then Kotori would've
brought them both...)"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, here, sit down. I'll bring you breakfast.	
Message	Shido	Ah, okay. Thank you...	
Message	None	"(If no one's here, that means it'll be breakfast
with just Rinne today...)"	
Message	Rinne	"Here, sorry to keep you waiting. I re-heated the
miso soup. The rice is nice and hot, too."	
Message	Shido	Oh, thank you. Let's eat.	
Message	Rinne	"I'm sorry. This morning was chaos, so it's just
bacon, eggs, and a salad."	
Message	Shido	"No, that's more than enough. Besides, Yoshino
wasn't feeling well, so I'm sure it was hard on
everyone..."	
Message	None	"(In fact, I feel bad for sleeping through the
whole thing.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, and here, take this. I didn't have much time
to prepare it."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, bento. You really have
everything taken care of."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. It's no problem at all.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Ummm...	
Message	Rinne	Hm? What's up?	
Message	Shido	Erm, um... I'll just dig in...	
Message	Rinne	Yes, please do.	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	None	"(I'm sure it'd be a good idea to talk about
something right now... but why does nothing come
to mind during times like these?!)"	
Message	Rinne	"What's wrong, Shido? Your face is a little red.
Do you have a fever again?"	
Message	Shido	Oh! No, it's nothing! I'm fine!	
Message	Rinne	Really?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... You're kinda strange, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Sorry...	
Message	Rinne	"Goodness, you don't need to apologize. You really
are a strange one. Hmmhmm..."	
Message	Shido	Oof...	
Message	Shido	Hey! I'm going to leave soon, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	Okay! I'm coming now, so just wait a moment!	
Message	Shido	We still have time, so no rush!	
Message	Rinne	Here, sorry for keeping you waiting! Shall we go?	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong, Rinne? Aren't we going?	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. We should make sure to lock up before we go.
Um, just a moment... Huh?"	
Message	Rinne	O-Oh, no... I think I might have lost my key...	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Rinne	"What should I do... It was so
important... but I..."	
Message	Shido	"Rinne, just calm down for now. You had it when you
came into the house, so it must
be somewhere inside!"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, right... You're right.	
Message	Shido	Hmmm, it's not here... Where could it have fallen?	
Message	Rinne	"I'm sorry, Shido... You made it for me and
everything, but since I don't have my act
together..."	
Message	Shido	"Really, don't worry! In fact,
it makes me feel better."	
Message	Rinne	Feel better...?! Is that... Are you teasing me?	
Message	Shido	"Haha, no, no. You always do things so flawlessly.
It's just nice to see that you make mistakes too."	
Message	Rinne	"So now you've realized that I'm actually
unreliable..."	
Message	Shido	"Of course you're reliable. You're always helping
me out. I wish you'd rely on me sometimes. I want
to do my best for you too, you know."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... Okay.	
Message	Shido	"So listen, Rinne... Let's think about it. What did
you do after you came in today?"	
Message	Rinne	"Um... I was making breakfast and bento... Then I
ate with you. Then I washed everything...
And after that..."	
Message	Shido	After that...?	
Message	Rinne	Oh, could it be?! Shido, you can go on ahead!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	*Pant, pant...* I... found it, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's great! Where was it?!	
Message	Rinne	I left it in the bathroom.	
Message	Shido	I see. Well, I'm glad you found it.	
Message	Rinne	"I've been carrying it on me all this time, but...
it looks like I was careless for a moment."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I'm sorry... It must have been because
I rushed you earlier."	
Message	Rinne	"No, it's not your fault, Shido. I'm the one at
fault, so I should be apologizing to you.
I won't ever lose it again..."	
Message	Shido	"It's not that big of a deal. At least we found it,
and it's not like it got stolen."	
Message	Rinne	It's not that...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	"This is... proof... that you acknowledged me as
family. As someone important. That's why I
don't want to lose it... Is that selfish of me?"	
Message	Shido	No, not at all. I think that it's important, too.	
Message	None	"(For Rinne, that key holds the same significance
as the ribbons that I gave to Kotori. They're
symbols of our little family.)"	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... Thank you, Shido. I'll go lock up, then.	
Message	Shido	All right... Please do!	
Message	Rinne	Also... losing this really was a first for me.	
Message	Shido	No worries. I'm glad you found it...	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Really, I had no idea what I'd do...	
Message	None	"(What is this feeling...? I feel kind
of nervous...)"	
Message	None	"(That's strange... There were plenty of times
before Tohka and the others came along
that I went to school with just Rinne.)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, what's wrong? You're spacing out...	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh, er... Just thinking about
how hot it is..."	
Message	Rinne	"You're right. The cicadas being so loud makes
it feel even hotter."	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Rinne	"But there are good things about summer. Playing in
the pool when we were kids, eating popsicles...
Not to mention cold Chinese noodles..."	
Message	Shido	"What? You're starting to sound
as gluttonous as Tohka."	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, Shido. Don't be such a downer. I was just
thinking happy thoughts. Besides, if you say it
like that, it's not very nice to Tohka-chan."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, sorry. I'll spare myself more scolding and
bow out here! I'll be going on ahead!
See you at school!"	
Message	Rinne	Ahh, hey! Come back heeere!	
Message	Shido	Haha sorry, but the finish line's so close!	
Message	Rinne	Good grief! Shido!	
Message	Shido	Whew! Made it!	
Message	Rinne	"Shido... You've got some nerve, suddenly running
away like that..."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, sorry. I just felt like a race. Whew, what
a workout... I'm really sweating here."	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh, you're so impulsive... It's great for your
health and all, but think about your hygiene.
Not just for your sake, but for others' too."	
Message	Tonomachi	Hey there, you two!	
Message	Rinne	Oh, good morning, Tonomachi-kun.	
Message	Shido	Morning, Tonomachi. Well, aren't you energetic.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hahaha! This morning I drank ten raw eggs all at
once! Startin' the day with a full tank!"	
Message	Shido	Hurgh... Just hearing that gave me heartburn.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, the only burning you're allowed is burning
envy for me, Itsuka! Don't fight it anymore. Let
yourself succumb to the flames of passion. Hehe..."	
Message	Shido	Who would ever be jealous of you!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe, you're a really funny person, Tonomachi-kun.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Ohhh! I knew there'd be someone who would
appreciate my inner spark, no matter how much
I've tried to hide it all these years!"	
Message	Shido	You were trying to hide it?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Rinne, if you're in trouble, you can always tell
me. Admit it, the only reason you're hanging with
Itsuka is because he's blackmailing you, isn't he?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"He has to be! Otherwise, it just doesn't
make any sense!"	
Message	Rinne	"W-Well, I don't think he has any information
like that... I-I'm sorry, Tonomachi-kun..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"No way... Damn it! Why is it always Itsuka?!
I refuse to accept it! I refuuuuuuse!!!"	
Message	Rinne	"He left. Is it okay to leave Tonomachi-kun
alone like that?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, it's fine. He'll come back later as if
nothing ever happened."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe, you're right.	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, Tonomachi. Blackmail? Really? We're
childhood friends, right Rinne? Kind of stuck
together at this point."	
Message	Rinne	"Shido... If you say stuck together"", that makes
me a little sad."""	
Message	Shido	Oh, no... That wasn't what I meant...	
Message	Rinne	"If you really feel that way, I can just leave,
you know?"	
Message	Shido	N-No, I'm really sorry! I was wrong!	
Message	Rinne	Goodness, it can't be helped... I forgive you.	
Message	Shido	Haha... That's a relief...	
Message	None	"(All right, I somehow managed to stay awake
through my morning classes!)"	
Message	None	(Now it's time for lunch.)	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Ah, Tohka! You were sleeping the whole time,
weren't you? It's already lunch, you know?"	
Message	Tohka	R-Right! And so... this is actually yesterday's...	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Shido... What is that?	
Message	Shido	Hm, oh, this? Rinne made it for me today.	
Message	Tohka	Hm... I-I see.	
Message	Shido	"So, what were you saying? Something
about yesterday?"	
Message	Tohka	I-It's nothing... Nothing at all!	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	Did I end up messing something up again...?	
Message	Shido	"I can't fight any more battles if I'm hungry...
For now, I guess I'll have lunch."	
Message	None	"(Mm, this is delicious! The exact kind of comfort
food I would expect from Rinne.)"	
Message	Tamae	Okay, we'll begin final period of homeroom now.	
Message	None	"(Homeroom already, huh? This day flew by, but also
dragged on forever...)"	
Message	Tamae	"Oh, today I have something very
important to tell you all."	
Message	Tonomachi	So what's this very important thing?	
Message	Tamae	"Well... I'm sure everyone is aware that this town
has a garrison for the Self-Defense Force, right?"	
Message	None	"(The Self-Defense Force. Origami saw me react to
the phrase, but stayed expressionless and still.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	Well yeah, I guess we know. What about it?	
Message	Tamae	"They sent a transmission to the school, and I'd
like to share it with everyone."	
Message	Tamae	"Let's see, it seems pretty complicated, but...
Currently, the observational equipment at the
Tengu City garrison isn't functioning properly."	
Message	None	"(Could it be that the AST
isn't functioning either?)"	
Message	None	"(Since Origami's expression hasn't changed, I
assume that means she must have already known.
Well, I guess that would make sense.)"	
Message	Tamae	"So... Alarms for spatial quakes and such may end
up being late, or maybe not even work at all..."	
Message	None	"(Isn't that really bad? Hm... Wait a minute. Does
that mean, not only the Spirits and the Fraxinus,
but AST will be affected as well...?)"	
Message	Tamae	"...Because of that, if you feel that something's
even the slightest bit abnormal, please stay
calm and head to each of your shelters."	
Message	Tamae	"Even then, there's no way of knowing when you'll
run into danger. Regardless, keep moving, stay
calm, and remember to follow the rules of PRT."""""	
Message	Tamae	"No Pushing, No Running, No Talking.
Do you understand?"	
Message	None	(What is happening to Tengu City...?)	
Message	None	(Is Origami all right...?)	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Tamae	"Okay, then. Homeroom is over for today.
Everyone, please be careful while heading home."	
Message	None	(Now then, what should I do today...?)	
Message	None	"(Oh... That's right, today Rinne asked me what my
plans were for after school...)"	
Message	None	(Speaking of which, where's Rinne...?)	
Message	Rinne	Shiiiido?	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Rinne	What's wrong?	
Message	Shido	It's nothing. More importantly, school's out.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, yeah. Do you still not have any plans?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but it's rare for you to invite me anywhere.
So what's up? Shopping?"	
Message	Rinne	Um... Let's go over there.	
Message	Shido	Okay...?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... Is here okay?	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	...So, what's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	Um, Shido...	
Message	Rinne	Do you... want to go on a date?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	U-Ummm...	
Message	Rinne	Really... what's with that face?	
Message	Shido	"No, it's just... up until today, whenever
I invited you anywhere..."	
Message	None	"(No matter how many times I tried to invite her
out, she asked me to invite others, or she called
someone else over to avoid being alone with me...)"	
Message	Shido	...What's with the sudden 180?	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... There's nothing to it.
A girl's heart can change."	
Message	None	(More like transform completely...)	
Message	Rinne	So then, um... What do you think?	
Message	Shido	Uh, yeah. I have no reason to refuse.	
Message	Rinne	Really? Thank goodness!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(And so, I ended up going on
a date alone with Rinne.)"	
Message	Rinne	Ummm... I wonder where it was...?	
Message	Shido	"What's wrong, Rinne? Are you
looking for something?"	
Message	Rinne	"Ah, yeah... just a second. I'm pretty sure it
was around here somewhere..."	
Message	Rinne	―Oh, there! Shido, I'd like to try eating that!	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Oh, I see. Popsicles, huh? You mentioned them
this morning when we were talking about summer."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah!	
Message	Shido	"All right, I'll go buy them. What flavor
would you like, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, no. Don't worry about it. It's fine.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	(She doesn't have to refuse so stubbornly...)	
Message	Rinne	"I-I thought maybe I'd like to look at
all the choices... You know?"	
Message	Shido	I see... Then can I ask you to get mine too?	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Leave it to me.	
Message	None	(Did something like this happen before?)	
Message	Rinne	Well then, I'll go on ahead!	
Message	Shido	All right. I'll be waiting here.	
Message	Rinne	Okay!	
Message	Rinne	Sorry I'm late.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, what did you end up getting? You really
took a—wh-whoa!"	
Message	Rinne	"Ehehe... I got kind of carried away
and maybe bought too many..."	
Message	Shido	"No matter how you look at it, there's no
way two people can eat all this..."	
Message	Rinne	"Since we're here, I wanted to try a bunch of
different flavors. You'll help me, right Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, you did buy them, so all we can do now
is eat them before they melt."	
Message	Rinne	Thank you. Let's try our best.	
Message	Shido	"I'm trying to think of a scenario where eating all
of these at once would be a good thing, but..."	
Message	None	"(What is it? It really does feel like
this happened before...)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido? If we don't hurry, they'll melt.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, right! But, there's no place here
to sit and eat all of these."	
Message	Shido	"All right, let's go to the park! Hurry, Rinne!
They're already melting!"	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Shido	"Aw, man... That was delicious! Popsicles really
are the best in summer."	
Message	Rinne	I-If's cold and... delifious...	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... Hey, Rinne! It's melting more
from the side where you're eating!"	
Message	Rinne	Urf...! E-Efen if you shay that...!	
Message	Shido	Crap, it's good... but my head's all frozen over―	
Message	None	(―?! W-Was it Yoshino...?!)	
Message	None	"(Why Yoshino...? Did I ever eat
popsicles with Yoshino?)"	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	None	"(No... but for some reason I have a memory of it.
When would it have been...?)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne... This is a strange thing to ask, but―	
Message	Rinne	This is... pretty good.	
Message	Shido	Huh...? What is―	
Message	Rinne	"Ah! Goodness, Shido... It's melting...
There's ice on your finger―"	
Message	Rinne	Om...!	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	No, you have to stay still...	
Message	Rinne	I have... to make it... clean...	
Message	Shido	B-But―	
Message	None	(―?!)	
Message	None	(Th-This happened before, too...!)	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne! I-It's fine already, so―!	
Message	Rinne	I guess... I'm not good enough.	
Choice		Ask Rinne something.	
Choice		Worry about Rinne.	
Message	Shido	Rinne... Is there something you're hiding from me?	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Rinne... Could you please tell
me what you know?"	
Message	Rinne	Ah, Shido... Behind you...	
Message	Shido	"Please. I'm begging you! Just a little more,
and I feel like it'll all connect! I want to
hear what you have to say..."	
Message	Rinne	Shido, I'm sorry.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What? All of a sudden―	
Message	Rinne	"If you've already realized it,
then all I can do is this."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is this place?!	
Message	Shido	Who is that...?!	
Message	???	......	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! S-Stooooop!	
Message	None	(It's attacking!)	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	None	(There's no mistake. I know this person!)	
Message	Shido	Aaaaagghhh...!!!!!	
Message	None	"(With no time to identify the source of that
strange feeling, I passed out.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rinne, what's wrong? Are you okay?	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Um, yeah. I'm fine... It looks
like I just ate too many popsicles!"	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... Well, don't push yourself.
If you force it, it won't taste as good."	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah, that's true...	
Message	Shido	Huh?! H-Hey! Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	Ehehehe... Sorry... I might be a little anemic.	
Message	Shido	Are you okay?!	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah, I'm fine... If I just rest a little...
I'm sure I'll feel better soon..."	
Message	Shido	If you're sure... then let's rest a bit for now.	
Message	Rinne	"I'm sorry, Shido. Even though it
was our date and everything..."	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry about it, your health
is more important."	
Message	Rinne	Thank you... But the popsicles melted...	
Message	Shido	Well, it can't be helped. These things happen.	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah... Thank you, Shido.	
Message	None	"(Is Rinne really okay? It's possible that
I've been relying on her too much.)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh, what is it?	
Message	Rinne	"It's calmed down mostly, so I'm fine now...
We should head home."	
Message	Shido	"I see... Then let's go. But tell me the minute you
start feeling sick again, okay? We can take our
time heading back. I can carry you if you need it."	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah. Thank you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Of course...	
Message	Rinne	Shido, how was the dinner?	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Oh, it was delicious, as always. You could
open up your own restaurant."	
Message	Rinne	Goodness, Shido. You're exaggerating.	
Message	Rinne	～♪ ～♪	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Hm? What's up?	
Message	Shido	"Um, starting tomorrow... I'll um, make breakfast
and bento and stuff, so you don't have to come
over to help or anything, okay?"	
Message	Rinne	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, you collapsed at the park today, right?
I thought maybe... you might be pushing
yourself a lot..."	
Message	Rinne	Th-That's not true at all.	
Message	Shido	"But these are things I should be doing by myself
anyway. And you can't always be looking after
the house, right?"	
Message	Rinne	"It's really not like that... I'm doing this
because I want to and..."	
Message	Shido	"But even so, especially with the test coming up,
I don't think it's good for me to be constantly
relying on you."	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	"I'd be more worried if I continued to let you push
yourself and cause you to collapse again."	
Message	Rinne	"I see... I guess I... really
was just in the way..."	
Message	Shido	No, that's not it! You've been a huge help, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	Then... Can I come tomorrow to help, too?	
Message	Shido	"Ngh...! But, it's just... I'd just like you
to at least rest during our test period..."	
Message	Rinne	"I don't like this... It really feels
like I'm in the way..."	
Message	Shido	That's not what I mean at all!	
Message	Rinne	It's okay, you don't have to reassure me. Okay?	
Message	Shido	Even if you say it's okay, I...	
Message	Rinne	"It's fine! Everything's just fine
the way it is now!"	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne...?	
Message	Rinne	"I can take care of myself! I won't cause
you any trouble, Shido! So, please...!"	
Message	Shido	"You're that concerned about me...?
Then, especially because of that, I..."	
Message	Rinne	Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Ahh, jeez! I got it, I got it! I understand!
Then when it's really too much,
you have to tell me, okay?"	
Message	Rinne	"Yes, I know. Thank you, Shido.
I'm sorry for pushing it."	
Message	Shido	No, there's nothing to apologize for.	
Message	Shido	About the investigation?	
Message	Kotori	"Today, there was a huge reaction from a
powerful but unstable spiritual energy."	
Message	Shido	D-Did something happen to the Spirit?	
Message	Kotori	"We haven't determined whether
or not it's a Spirit yet..."	
Message	Shido	I see... So, what was the reaction?	
Message	Kotori	"It was brief, but the spiritual wave pattern that
we previously identified as unstable
began to stabilize. Only..."	
Message	Shido	Only?	
Message	Kotori	"In the end... it became severely distorted
and grew even more unstable."	
Message	Shido	"That means if that spiritual power
were to go berserk..."	
Message	Kotori	"That'll be it. I've said this before, but it's
likely to be a repeat of the great Eurasia
Disaster."	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Kotori	Just what in the world is happening...?	
Message	Shido	I can't even begin to imagine...	
Message	Kotori	"You're right. It's our job to figure it out. We've
got to find a way to dispel this barrier. Or...
avoid a situation where we all blow up together."	
Message	None	(Kotori seems really backed into a corner...)	
Message	Kotori	"What's certain is that we have even less wiggle
room than we thought. We need some sort of clue
about whatever trapped us in this barrier..."	
Message	Shido	Tell me if there's anything I can do to help.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you're the one holding onto the reins of
the Spirits. You'd better be careful to make sure
you don't cause them to lose control."	
Message	Shido	I understand...	
Message	Kotori	I'll be turning in for today, then.	
Message	Shido	All right, good night...	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. Good night, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	An unstable enemy, huh...?	
Message	Shido	There's still so much we don't understand...	
Message	None	"(I finally started to think of what might happen
if I don't study for the test. But it's no use.
I can't concentrate at all.)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe I'm still not fully recovered yet. Even
though I'm forcing myself, I'm still
really struggling...)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe instead of pushing myself, if I just relax
a little bit, I might be able to switch back.)"	
Message	None	(...For now, I'll go to the bathroom.)	
Message	Shido	Yaaaawn...	
Message	Shido	Gah! K-Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	...?!	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait! I didn't do this on purpose! And why
didn't you lock the door?!"	
Message	Kotori	Why, you... PERVERRRT!!!!	
Message	Shido	GAH!	
Message	Shido	"Ow, ow, ow... I told you, it was an accident!
I was just spaced out and―"	
Message	Kotori	"I know. If you did it on purpose, you wouldn't
be getting off this easily."	
Message	Shido	Urgh...	
Message	Kotori	"You'd be arrested and taken away. Your face would
be all over the news. A certain friend of yours
would probably end up very popular."	
Message	Shido	Friend?	
Message	Kotori	I figured he'd do it eventually; being called\n'Pretty Boy Itsuka' or 'Sex Animal Itsuka'. But\nto do that to his sister... Something like that.	
Message	Shido	That's a weirdly specific comment!	
Message	Kotori	"If you don't want to end up like that, knock.
Even an amoeba thinks a little more as it lives."	
Message	Shido	"A-An amoeba... Anyway, I'll be careful
next time. But―"	
Message	Kotori	What?	
Message	Shido	Are you okay?	
Message	Kotori	What?	
Message	Shido	"It's just... You looked pretty tired
in the bathroom."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph, it's all over for me if I'm at the point
where you're worrying about me."	
Message	Shido	Hey, I'm being serious, okay?	
Message	Kotori	I'm fine. It's something else that's the problem.
