Message	Shido	"Man. Helping Tama-chan organize worksheets
took up my whole lunch break. I guess I could
hit the rooftop to enjoy my lunch."	
Message	Shido	"You know. If I could eat quietly in the
classroom, I wouldn't come here."	
Message	Shido	...Oh?	
Message	Kurumi	"Good day, Shido-san. Fancy seeing you here,
no?"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, you were here?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh. Is that a problem for you?	
Message	Shido	"No. Eating alone is no fun. It's nice to
have company."	
Message	Kurumi	How kind of you to say.	
Message	Shido	I packed too much food. Want some, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	No. I've already eaten.	
Message	Shido	Oh, yeah?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. This morning. Before we bumped into
one another."	
Message	Shido	This morning. Wait, in the alley?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Wait. Don't tell me you ate—	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe...	
Message	Kurumi	"Forget that. Shouldn't you hurry and eat?
Your lunch break is almost over."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean forget that...	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Kurumi	"My, seems like my time is up. Well, I will be
on my way now."	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Good day.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...	
Message	Shido	Did she eat another human...?	
Message	Shido	"No, she wouldn't. I shouldn't doubt her.
I should trust her."
