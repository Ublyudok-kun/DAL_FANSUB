Message	Shido	"Ah. Class is over. Now, I gotta think of what
to do after schoool. Hm...?"	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Onii-chan! Hey! Hey!	
Message	Shido	Kotori? What are you doing at my school?	
Message	Kotori	I needed to talk to Reine. I'm about to head home.	
Message	Shido	I see... Oh? Your ribbon... it's white today?	
Message	Kotori	Yup.	
Message	None	"(I haven't seen that in a while.
Her carefree way about her right now...
It feels kind of nostalgic.)"	
Message	Shido	"And you're dressed like that out seeing
Reine-san. What are you trying to pull?"	
Message	Kotori	"If you're always so nervous like that,
one day you're going to pop."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	Is there a problem?	
Message	Shido	"Oh no, no...
I'm glad you're having fun, Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	I've always wanted to ask you, Onii-chan...	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kotori	"Which version of me do you like better?
The me now or when I'm at the control room?"	
Message	None	"(What?! Wait... why is she asking me which
version of her I like better? Hm...)"	
Message	Shido	U-Uh...	
Choice		The light Kotori.	
Choice		The dark Kotori.	
Choice		I like them both the same.	
Message	Shido	If I were to choose, I'd say you now...	
Message	Kotori	Really? Why do you say that?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean why... Well your version now won't leave a deep scar in my heart.	
Message	Shido	"When I see you in your light mode, I feel like we're
in the goold old days. I remember when we were
kids and life was so easy."	
Message	Kotori	So you have a weird sister complex.	
Message	Shido	What?! Sister complex?!	
Message	Kotori	"Also, why are you thinking of when we
were young? Isn't that weird to you?"	
Message	Shido	What? No, wait, I'm talking about...	
Message	Kotori	Nice! My brother has a weird sister complex!	
Message	Shido	Hey! Wait! That's not true at all!	
Message	Shido	...Why?! I thought light Kotori would never hurt me!	
Message	Shido	"I... I don't mind the you now but I guess I don't mind the
pretty hard words you say when you're at Ratatoskr."	
Message	Kotori	"So, that makes you a super masochistic hentai man
who gets excited with hardcore things?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wait! How did you come up with that?	
Message	Kotori	"What a let down, Onii-chan! I'm going to reconsider
how I deal with you from now on!"	
Message	Shido	Wait, that's not what I meant.	
Message	Kotori	Ah! My brother is a super masochistic hentai guy!	
Message	Shido	No! I'm not!	
Message	Shido	Honestly, I can't choose.	
Message	Kotori	Hm. Why?	
Message	Shido	"Well, either way, you're still my little sister.
I like you whatever type of person you are."	
Message	Kotori	O-Onii-chan... who told you to say that?	
Message	Shido	I don't like that! I like any version of you, got it?	
Message	Kotori	"H-Hm. You putting it to words like that
is gonna make me blush."	
Message	Shido	"Well... I guess I'm embarrassed
saying it, too, but it's the truth."	
Message	Kotori	Nwaaaah?! W-Well, let's do this again soon! Bye!	
Message	Shido	What the? Kotori's so weird...
