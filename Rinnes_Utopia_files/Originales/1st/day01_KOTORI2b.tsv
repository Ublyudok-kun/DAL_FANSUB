Message	Shido	"Man, this is no use... It seems like Kotori
won't be going out any time soon. Her
schedule must be packed."	
Message	Shido	"*sigh* There's no point in waiting here.
Guess I could head home and wait for her there."	
Message	Shido	It's 7... She should be home any time now.	
Message	Shido	Oh. Speak of the devil...	
Message	Shido	Welcome back, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Yup, I'm back. Where are the others?	
Message	Shido	"They've all had dinner, so they went up to
kill time in their rooms."	
Message	Kotori	Seems a little early for them... So...?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? What?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm asking if you did it or not. You know, um...
Dating the others."	
Message	Shido	Oh. Sorry, but I didn't.	
Message	Kotori	"What?! Then what the hell have you been
doing?"	
Message	Shido	Um... Making dinner, I guess.	
Message	Kotori	I-I didn't think you could be this stupid...	
Message	Shido	Ugh... Do you have to lay into me like that?	
Message	Kotori	"Why should I be mindful of someone who
isn't mindful of his responsibilities?"	
Message	Kotori	"What you have to do right now is go on a
date with the Spiritsâ€”"	
Message	Shido	"I know that. But... I was worried about you,
Kotori. I can't help it."	
Message	Shido	"I decided to make your favorite dish and
eat dinner with you. I guess this wouldn't
qualify as much of a date for you."	
Message	Kotori	What...?	
Message	Kotori	*sigh*...	
Message	Kotori	"You have a serious ""sister complex"", Shido."	
Message	Shido	Y-You know what...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, whatever. There's nothing to say about
it now. Not like you could go on a date tonight
anyway."	
Message	Shido	"That's right. It's all good. Now, go on and take
a seat. Let me prepare your dinner."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	So, why are you staring at me so much?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I was just wondering if you liked it
or not..."	
Message	Kotori	"It's not about whether or not I like it!
I gotta eat or else I can't work, so I'm
just eating!"	
Message	Shido	"If that's how you feel, then maybe it's not
worth making. You used to say, I love when you make me dinner, Onii-chan!"""""	
Message	Kotori	"Sh-Shut up! I didn't say it wasn't delicious,
though! Shido, your meals are... Well, I'm
just used to them..."	
Message	Shido	"Well, it's not like I did anything different
than usual..."	
Message	Kotori	But I do... like the meals you make, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Cool. That's nice, even if you don't mean it.	
Message	Kotori	O-Oh. Well, it's not like that...	
Message	Shido	"Haha. It's all good. There's more, so eat as
much as you'd like, okay? Don't hold back!"	
Message	Kotori	"What's your problem? Are you trying to fatten
me up?"	
Message	Shido	"You're in the middle of a growth spurt. What
are you talking about?"	
Message	Kotori	Oh...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, you're still staring...
Cut it out, would ya?"	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh. Sorry. I just feel like it's been a while
since we've spoken like this."	
Message	Kotori	I know, huh. I've been busy lately.	
Message	Shido	Have you been investigating... the incident?	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, but nothing. Nothing is progressing.	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Kotori	There are too many variables, too many unknowns.	
Message	Shido	Gotcha. Seems like all we can do is wait, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Yup. In the meantime, it's your job to keep the
Spirits from going rogue. Pretty big
responsibility."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... I'll keep that mind.	
Message	Kotori	So, have the others eaten dinner yet?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Yeah.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh. D-Did... you say something so we'd
be alone?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh. We're going to a spooky area today.
We decided to eat early in anticipation."	
Message	Kotori	What...? S-Spooky area?	
Message	Shido	Yup yup. Oh. Did you want to come with?	
Message	Kotori	I-I refuse.	
Message	Shido	W-Well, you sure answered quick.	
Message	Shido	Wait... You've never liked ghosts, have you?	
Message	Kotori	What?! I-It's not like that!	
Message	Kotori	"I just don't believe in that crap! It's not
like I'm scared to go or something!"	
Message	Shido	Then, let's go together!	
Message	Kotori	Well, I-I don't know...	
Message	Shido	"I'm sure it would be even more fun
if you tagged along. Come on!"	
Message	Kotori	...Okay, fine.	
Message	Kotori	"Th-Then if something happens, it'll be all your
fault, okay?! You better take responsibility and
protect me!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, I'm ready! Let's depart now!	
Message	Yoshino	Me too... I can leave any time now.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, seems like everyone's ready. Come on,
Kotori. Hurry up and get ready."	
Message	Kotori	F...Fine!
