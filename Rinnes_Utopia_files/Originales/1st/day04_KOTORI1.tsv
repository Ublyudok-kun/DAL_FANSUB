Message	Shido	"All right. I'm going to ask Kotori out on a date
today."	
Message	Kotori	...Hello?	
Message	Shido	Hey, it's me.	
Message	Kotori	Shido? What do you want?	
Message	Shido	"Uh, I was wondering if you wanted to go on a
date today."	
Message	Kotori	A date, huh...?	
Message	Shido	Are you busy?	
Message	Kotori	Not really. Fine, let's go on a date.	
Message	None	(Huh...? That sure seemed... easy. Weird...)	
Message	Kotori	What?!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, nothing. So where should we meet?"""	
Message	Kotori	I think we should stay home today.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	Th-The weather channel said it might rain\nthis evening...	
Message	Shido	"What? Really? But it's so nice out. I don't
remember hearing about that on the weather
channel."	
Message	Kotori	Wh-Who cares! ANYWAYS! We'll have our\ndate at home!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Got it.	
Message	Kotori	Later!	
Message	Shido	...Why was Kotori so emotional?	
Message	Shido	I'm hoooome.	
Message	Kotori	You're late!	
Message	Shido	N-No way. I didn't stop anywhere on the way.	
Message	Kotori	"Is that why it took you so long getting home?
Jeez, you're slow in every way."	
Message	None	(She's... acting her like usual self, huh?)	
Message	None	"(Kotori was gung-ho all morning, but maybe
I was just imagining things...?)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Hm? Y-Yeah... What's up?	
Message	Kotori	Don't just stand there. Sit down.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Huh? Where's everyone else?	
Message	Kotori	"Beats me. No one was here by the time
I came home."	
Message	Shido	That's odd. I wonder where they went.	
Message	Kotori	"We're in the middle of a date, and you're
worrying about other girls?"	
Message	Shido	No. It's not like that.	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. Suspicious.	
Message	Kotori	Whatever. Now you sit there. I'll pour some tea.	
Message	Shido	Oh, I will...	
Message	Kotori	I said I'm going to do it!	
Message	Shido	I-I see. Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Hmph.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori... is really aggressive.	
Message	Shido	"Hm. I wonder if it's okay for me to let her
do it."	
Message	Shido	"I have nothing to do while I wait, so maybe
I could help her out."	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Aah!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry! Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?	
Message	Kotori	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Shido	Okay, good.	
Message	Kotori	But... my clothes are wet.	
Message	Shido	I guess you'll have to take a bath and change.	
Message	Kotori	"Huh? I-It's fine. This is nothing. It'll dry
eventually."	
Message	Shido	But what if you catch a cold?	
Message	Kotori	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Come on. I'll clean up.	
Message	Kotori	B-But...	
Message	Shido	Why are you resisting?	
Message	Kotori	Because... I'm finally alone with you...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"We're on a date, and I don't want to spend
time on that."	
Message	None	(WH-WH-WH-WH-WH-WHAT IS KOTORI SAYING?!)	
Message	None	"(It's almost like she doesn't want to bathe
because she wants to be with me as long as
possible. Nonono. That's my sister. It can't be.)"	
Message	None	"(A-Anyways, I should calm down. It should be
my priority to have her take a bath. Yeah, that's
right. Think about the rest later, right? Yeah!)"	
Message	Shido	G-Go on! Just take a bath, okay?!	
Message	Kotori	B-But...	
Message	Shido	I-I'll go with you! So, come on!	
Message	Kotori	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	How did things come to this?	
Message	None	(Uh, no. This was all my fault.)	
Message	None	"(I never thought Kotori would agree to it! I
thought she'd call me a big pervert! Then, she'd
punch me and storm off to the bathroom.)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido, I'm going in, so turn around.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay.	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	...Scoot over.	
Message	Shido	I-I can't. This is the limit.	
Message	Kotori	Guess it can't be helped then.	
Message	Shido	Uuuuuhhh... Um...	
Message	Kotori	What? This was your idea. You're pathetic.	
Message	Shido	W-Well, I didn't think it'd happen.	
Message	Kotori	"I mean, I took measures to keep people away.
It's pointless if I can't be with you."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What? Sorry... I didn't get that.	
Message	Kotori	...I was talking to myself.	
Message	Shido	But... this feels nostalgic.	
Message	Kotori	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	We always took baths like this as children.	
Message	Kotori	I... I don't remember anything like that.	
Message	Shido	"How could I forget so easily? It's a memory
with my sister, after all."	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	But man, you haven't grown mucâ€”	
Message	Shido	OUCH! What the heck?!	
Message	Kotori	That was so rude!	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, what did you want to say? ""My,
how much you've grown""?"	
Message	Kotori	Ew, yuck. Not that, either.	
Message	Shido	Then what should I have said?	
Message	Kotori	Don't say anything! Just sit there!	
Message	Shido	...?! O-Okay.	
Message	Kotori	That's right. Just like that. Quiet.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Is someone calling?	
Message	Kotori	...Me?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh. Reine. Yeah, thanks for today... and for
covering for me."	
Message	Kotori	"Huh? Tohka and Yoshino are coming?
Wh-What do you mean?!"	
Message	Kotori	Any minute now... Wait, Reine...?! Oh...	
Message	Kotori	Well, that's predictable.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	I can't let them see this... Shido!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it?!	
Message	Kotori	"How long are you gonna be in there for?!
Hurry up and get out!"	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What's the matter, Kotori? And don't
just stand up!"	
Message	Kotori	Huh? Aah! Wh-What are you staring at?!	
Message	Shido	OUCH!	
Message	Tohka	Shido! I'm home!	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Kotori	*pant, pant*... S-Seems like I made it in time.	
Message	Shido	"*pant, pant*... Seems like it. W-Welcome home,
you two."	
Message	Reine	"Sorry. I knew you two were having fun. I should
have bought more time, but..."	
Message	Kotori	F-Fun... It wasn't like that.	
Message	Reine	Oh...? Am I mistaken?	
Message	Kotori	I-I DON'T KNOW!
