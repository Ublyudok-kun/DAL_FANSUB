Message	Shido	Kurumi. Sorry, someone's calling me...	
Message	Kurumi	Calling?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'll hang up really quickly.	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, what are you doing?!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry.	
Message	Kotori	"This is urgent. I found out where the enemy's\nlocated."	
Message	Shido	The enemy...?	
Message	Kotori	"Looks like it was Neo Tengu Tower all along."	
Message	Shido	"Enemy? Neo Tengu Tower...? Hey, wait!
What are you talking about?"	
Message	Kotori	"What? Are you going senile? What's the\nmatter with you?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, you still there?!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Sorry. Something weird just came over
me. Is what you said true?"	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. Totally. You're with Kurumi right now,\nright?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"Can you put her on?"	
Message	Shido	Wha...?	
Message	Kotori	"For whatever comes next, I need a Spirit's\npower. Kurumi hasn't been affected by the\nSpirit's rampage, so I'd like her to fight..."	
Message	Shido	B-But...	
Message	Kotori	"You heard me. It's not a guarantee she'll\nfight. She needs to decide, give her the\nphone so I can convince her."	
Message	Shido	...Kurumi. Kotori wants to speak with you.	
Message	Kurumi	Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	...Hello? Yes. Yes... Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	"Right... Yes. Right. Understood. Promise me
something though."	
Message	Kurumi	...Hehehe. Very well. Then, excuse me.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, let's go together. This has been
lovely, but we'll save it for later."	
Message	Shido	Are you sure?	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, you're coming with me, aren't you?
My chance for atonement has arrived."	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Kurumi	Then, brace yourself.	
Message	Shido	Got it!	
Message	Shido	"Neo Tengu Tower... Who would've guessed it
was under our noses the whole time?"	
Message	Kurumi	"In the heart of the city. A fitting locale for our
enemy."	
Message	Shido	Right. Are you good to go, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Shido	Were you in my dreams...?	
Message	Kurumi	Are you a Spirit?	
Message	???	No one asked for this ending.	
Message	Shido	No one... asked?	
Message	???	"If only you were content to live in the idyll
contentment I created..."	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, don't! Her powers are double
mine."	
Message	Shido	Who are you...?	
Message	???	"I am the ruler of this world, Eden.
If you prefer another name, call me Ruler."	
Message	Ruler	"But... telling you is pointless.
I will banish you."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, fall back!	
Message	Ruler	"I saved your life, and you waste my blessing.
Such defiance deserves a punishment."	
Message	Kurumi	What...? *cough*...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, you cannot...	
Message	Ruler	Scatter.	
Message	Kurumi	NOOOOOOOOOO!	
Message	Shido	KURUMI?! KURUMIIIII! Why? Why did...	
Message	Ruler	"Farewell, Shido Itsuka. I hope for your next
dream to be a happier one."	
Message	Ruler	You promised me... you'd care for Kurumi.
