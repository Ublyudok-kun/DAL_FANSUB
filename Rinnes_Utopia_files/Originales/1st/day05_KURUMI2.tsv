Message	Shido	"Maybe I'll check out the rooftop. I hope Kurumi's
there."	
Message	Shido	"I'll try going to the rooftop. Kurumi's like a
phantom, so she might be there. At least,
I hope."	
Message	Shido	What am I talking about...?	
Message	None	"(I sound like a girl with a crush... Kind of
embarrassing.)"	
Message	???	Itsuka-kun!	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Tamae	I finally got you...	
Message	Shido	"H-Huh? What are you doing here Tama-cha—
I mean, Okamine-sensei?"	
Message	Tamae	"I know you've been on leave so it can't be
helped, but your social studies paper is due
today."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Tamae	You're the only one who hasn't turned it in yet.	
Message	Shido	"Um, could you give me an extension? I'll get
right to it."	
Message	Tamae	Nope. You can't slide out of this one!	
Message	Tamae	"You'd better turn it in today. I'll wait for you
in the teacher's lounge... Promise me!"	
Message	Shido	*sigh*...	
Message	None	(I can't help it, I guess... I'll do my report.)	
Message	Tamae	"...Good job. Next time, be sure to not forget,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	Okay. Sorry about that. I'll be on my way then!	
Message	Tamae	Okay!	
Message	Shido	*sigh*... Look at the time.	
Message	Shido	"The sun's set. I don't think I can go on a date
today... *sigh*."	
Message	Kurumi	"If I will suffice, then I can go with you now if
you'd like?"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi?! So you WERE at school today!	
Message	Kurumi	"Good day, Shido-san. Last night was certainly
stimulating."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Thanks to you, I got a scolding from my
little sister. But you saved me. Thanks."	
Message	Kurumi	You're welcome.	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, I've told you before, but you shouldn't
be walking around school like this. It'd only
cause more problems."	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, but I'm careful not let anyone detect me.	
Message	Kurumi	"I wanted to see you earlier, but... I am
refraining as much as I can, you know?"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...	
Message	Kurumi	...So then, how about that date?	
Message	Shido	You won't blush again, will you?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe, I don't know. That's up to you.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, fine. It's kinda hard to find somewhere
to go right now, isn't it?"	
Message	Kurumi	...I don't mind it being here.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Here... as in the classroom?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, isn't it wonderful? To be your classmate.	
Message	Shido	"You were my classmate until recently. Although
it was a little short for my liking."	
Message	Kurumi	Don't mind the details.	
Message	Kurumi	"I'm regretting it a little. I wish I had done
much more when we were classmates."	
Message	Shido	Then, do you want to be my classmate?	
Message	Kurumi	...Excuse me?	
Message	Shido	"It's only you and me here. It might just be
role-play, but if you don't mind, we can play
pretend."	
Message	Kurumi	Well... That sounds very fun. Hehe.	
Message	Kurumi	"Then, allow me to introduce myself. My name
is Kurumi Tokisaki. Nice to meet you."	
Message	Shido	"Isn't that different from how it happened?
Remember... you used to say, "I am a Spirit"..."	
Message	Kurumi	But then I wouldn't be a normal classmate.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... you have a point.	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	Um, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	What is it?	
Message	Kurumi	...What do classmates do?	
Message	Shido	Uh, I don't know.	
Message	Kurumi	My, you don't know either, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	I never thought about it.	
Message	Shido	You wanna just do stuff that we'd do at school?	
Message	Kurumi	Sure. Then, how's this...?	
Message	Kurumi	...Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes, Tokisaki-sensei.	
Message	Kurumi	This area requires correction.	
Message	Shido	Oh! I-I'm sorry...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Bad boy.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	(S-So close! Her face is too close!)	
Message	Kurumi	...Oh, and I spotted one more error.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kurumi	When we are alone... you must call me Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi... sensei.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe...	
Message	Shido	Y-You're a little... too close!	
Message	Kurumi	Silly boy, it's intentional.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Kurumi	"We're not done yet. Enough calling me "sensei".
Now, go on..."	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi...	
Message	Kurumi	Well done. Would you like a reward?	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Keep your clothes on!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, but I'm just getting started.	
Message	Shido	"Y-You know, Kurumi... Classmates wouldn't
do this!"	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Come to think of it, you're right.	
Message	Shido	"You know, Kurumi. Where'd you learn how to
act out these... scenarios?"	
Message	Kurumi	Where? At the bookstore you visited, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	"Seriously?! And you should've called...
Wait, no, that's not even it! AAAAH!"	
Message	Kurumi	Are you that shocked?	
Message	Shido	Please forget you saw that.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Very well.	
Message	Shido	Haha...	
Message	Kurumi	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Well, I figured it'd be like this.	
Message	Kurumi	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Being able to talk about whimsical stuff or
nothing at all... Even being able to have fun."	
Message	Kurumi	Is that so...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I think... That's how it is for us.	
Message	Shido	Oh, I gotta get going soon.	
Message	Kurumi	I see. I had hoped to be with you a bit longer.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry... If I had made the time...	
Message	Kurumi	I don't mind. Rather...	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Kurumi	"Thank you for today. I quite enjoyed myself.
Although our time was short, I was able to
be your classmate again."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kurumi	It's nice to have a friend.	
Message	Shido	Yup, the feeling is mutual.	
Message	Kurumi	Well, good night, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Okay... Later.	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi seemed to be having a good time. It
was as if she was an ordinary girl."	
Message	None	"(But Kurumi has a secret, and it might be
something we don't see eye to eye on.)"	
Message	None	"(I won't know unless I ask her the truth,
but... I wish Kurumi could tell me first.)"	
Message	None	"(I want to continue enjoying myself around
Kurumi. Thinking about it now, maybe this is what
Kotori meant when she said I have no urgency.)"
