Message	None	"(What am I even doing? I need to go on
dates with the Spirits to stabilize them,
but I'm looking around for Origami.)"	
Message	None	(I need to sit and have a chat with her...)	
Message	None	"(I mean, there's Kotori's thing... and my visit
from yesterday.)"	
Message	None	"(And today's lunch, what was that all about?
Origami seemed desperate or something.)"	
Message	None	"(Huh? Is someone throwing trash into an
incinerator? Origami...?)"	
Message	None	"(What should I do? We're about to be face-
to-face, and I've got nothing to say. What is
she burning, anyways? I-I'm curious!)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami!	
Message	Origami	Shido, is something wrong?	
Message	Shido	Uh, good question. What are you doing here?	
Message	Origami	Disposing the trash.	
Message	Shido	Were you put in charge of cleaning?	
Message	Origami	No. I'm in charge of the shoe rack.	
Message	Shido	Sh-Shoe rack...?	
Message	None	"(I peeked inside the incinerator, and I saw
a stack of what appeared to be letters burning.)"	
Message	None	(Why letters...?)	
Message	Shido	"...?! O-Origami! Don't tell me! Are those...
love letters people have sent you?"	
Message	Origami	Are they?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?! Didn't you bother to open them?	
Message	Origami	"Unless they're from you, they're worthless
to me."	
Message	Shido	Argh! B-But...	
Message	None	"(That's horrible! Horrible, but when she puts
it like that, why can't I respond?)"	
Message	None	"(The letters in the incinerator seem like
they're glaring at me as they turn to ash.)"	
Message	None	"(I never knew she had so many suitors. She
IS quite popular...)"	
Message	None	"(I thought Tonomachi was just talking her up,
but maybe being ranked as the 3rd-best potential
girlfriend has more merit than I thought.)"	
Message	Origami	You were saying, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? Oh, right! I just wanted to, um, have
a chat, so I came looking for you."	
Message	Origami	Have a chat?	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Origami	"Aside from talking, there are more personal
and beneficial activities in which we could
partake."	
Message	Shido	H-Hold that thought!	
Message	Origami	Oh.	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh, what I wanted to talk with you about
was..."	
Choice		Kotori.	
Choice		Lunch.	
Choice		AST.	
Message	Shido	"You came to visit me yesterday, but it ended
with me pushing you out. So, I apologize."	
Message	Origami	"It's fine. So long as you feel better, Shido.
That's all that matters."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	D-Do you remember what we discussed?	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	About... Kotori not being your enemy.	
Message	Origami	Well, I still disagree.	
Message	Shido	Yeah... I know it's hard to believe.	
Message	Origami	"Don't get me wrong. Shido, I do wish to believe
in what you told me. However, there's no proof
that Kotori Itsuka isn't Efreet."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... But I know it's true. There was
someone else besides Kotori there that day!
That much I'm sure of!"	
Message	Origami	I, too, wish for that to be the case.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Origami	"I do not... want to kill your little sister,
Shido."	
Message	Shido	"What? O-Oh... Thanks for understanding,
Origami."	
Message	Origami	"That goes both ways. When I visited you,
you hadn't acted any differently to me. In
fact, I thought you would reject me."	
Message	Shido	"Well, if you were paid a sudden visit like
that, anyone would—"	
Message	Origami	"I truly sought out to kill your sister. That
is a truth that cannot be erased."	
Message	Shido	...! O-Oh, guess you have a point.	
Message	Shido	"Well, it wasn't the kindest gesture, sure,
but even so... I want for us to converse
normally."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Is that okay?	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	...Thank you.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'll be on my way. Glad we got to chat.
Later!"	
Message	Origami	Mm...	
Message	Shido	"The commotion at lunch, what was all that
about?"	
Message	Origami	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I get that you and Tohka butt heads
often, but... I feel like today was a lot more
intense than usual."	
Message	None	(It almost killed me...)	
Message	Origami	"I would like to apologize for that. I feel
guilty."	
Message	Shido	"Oh. You don't have to apologize, but if you
want to talk about it, I'm here to listen."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, I guess I can't blame you. I know
I'm not reliable."	
Message	Origami	Don't misunderstand. I don't think that.	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Origami	It's just...	
Message	Shido	Just?	
Message	Origami	You can't cheat.	
Message	Shido	Huh...? HUH?	
Message	None	(When did I do that?!)	
Message	Origami	"I won't let anyone stand in the way of our
future."	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh, Origami-san? What are you talking
about?"	
Message	Origami	That's all I wanted to say.	
Message	Shido	U-Uh...	
Message	Origami	Come.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Where... do you want me
to go?"	
Message	Origami	"From here, the P.E. lockers are closest.
If we hide in the shadows, no one will
find us."	
Message	Origami	This way.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait! Stop! STOOOOP!	
Message	Origami	What?	
Message	Shido	"Um, don't what"" me! What do you plan"	
Message	Origami	"I put your life in danger. The only way to
repay you is with my bod— to do once we get there?"""	
Message	Shido	"It's okay! Don't say another word!
It's okay! I'm not mad about that!"	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Shido	"Anyways, I'll be on my way then! I'm glad
we got to chat! Later!"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Um. You know how you're in charge of the
AST Self-Defense force?"	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"After the incident, I was worried about if
everything was okay."	
Message	None	"(She went crazy in a public space. I'm almost
certain she got a reprimanding.)"	
Message	Origami	"Normally, I would have been dishonorably
discharged immediately."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	But I was prepared.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Origami	But...	
Message	Shido	But...?	
Message	Origami	"Both the rogatory questioning and the
official punishment were deferred. For
reasons I cannot explain."	
Message	Shido	"Th-Then... bottom line is, you weren't fired,
right? That's wonderful."	
Message	Origami	Why are you reacting like that, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well. Yeah, huh... I wanted you to stop
attacking the Spirits, but..."	
Message	None	"(That's right. I don't want Origami to kill
Kotori, nor do I want her to fight the other
Spirits either.)"	
Message	Shido	"Strange. I wonder why. It's a relief to hear
you weren't fired."	
Message	Shido	"I don't blame Kotori for calling me her idiot
brother. Hahaha."	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"But it's still so odd. I wonder why they
hadn't gone through with punishing you."	
Message	Origami	"It's a mystery. Despite being told by AST that
I'd be put under house arrest and lose
access to my Realizer... nothing happened."	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Are you allowed to tell me, a normal
civilian, any of this?"	
Message	Origami	Yes. As long as you don't tell anyone, Shido.	
Message	Shido	R-Really? Hey, Origami?	
Message	Origami	What is it?	
Message	Shido	"Have you heard any rumors... of some big
experiment performed by AST?"	
Message	Origami	Why do you ask?	
Message	Shido	"Well—! It's all confidential, of course, but
I was just curious..."	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Nothing! Forget I asked, okay?	
Message	Origami	Yeah?	
Message	Shido	"A-Anyways... I'm going home, okay? Glad we
got to chat, Origami. Later!"	
Message	Origami	...
