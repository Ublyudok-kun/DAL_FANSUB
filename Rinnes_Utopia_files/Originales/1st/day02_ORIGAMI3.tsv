Message	Shido	"Phew, maybe I ate too much. But Rinne's food is
always so delicious I can't help but eat too much."	
Message	Shido	"There's a hint of sweetness. It's hard to explain, but
it's so appetizing. It makes my body feel warm and
comfortable. Just a good home-cooked meal."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Who could be calling?	
Message	Shido	What?! O-Origami...?	
Message	Shido	Hello?	
Message	Origami	"Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. What's up?	
Message	Origami	"I know everything about you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"Thanks for today."	
Message	Shido	Oh... yeah. Me too, thank you.	
Message	Origami	"..."	
Message	Shido	Uh... so... is that it? Did you want to say anything else...	
Message	Origami	"Not really."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. I see.	
Message	Origami	"Do I need business to call you?"	
Message	Shido	Well... that's not it.	
Message	Origami	"I couldn't get a hold of the AST."	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Origami	"They may really be busy."	
Message	Shido	I-I see. It must be really tough right now.	
Message	Origami	"Mmm..."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	"..."	
Message	None	"(Our conversation has to continue! But w-what
should we even talk about?)"	
Message	Origami	"How's your studying going?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh. It's not. I was going to ask Rinne
or Origami to help me study."	
Message	Origami	"Why did you say Rinne's name first?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	Nothing. Well, I'll talk to you again later.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(Ah... did I do it again?)	
Message	None	"(Or rather... what was that all about?
I wonder if she called me to give me information
about the AST.)"	
Message	None	"(OH! I didn't tell Kotori that I told Origami everything.
I should tell her, right?)"	
Message	None	(*sigh* I'll go report to her after I take a bath.)	
Message	None	(Ah. I don't know why I'm so tired.)	
Message	None	(I should soak for a long time today...)	
Message	Shido	Oh? Someone left the light on?	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	Shi...do?	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...? What are you...?	
Message	Kotori	What? Why are you in a daze?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Uh... u-uh... I was just wondering if we
ran out of shampoo or not..."	
Message	Kotori	You idiot! You idiot brother!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry! It wasn't on purpose!	
Message	Kotori	You ready?	
Message	Shido	W-Wait. Can we talk about...	
Message	Kotori	Ugh. You're hopeless.	
Message	Shido	"I-I said I'm sorry. We used to bathe together
back in the day. What's the big deal?"	
Message	Kotori	Did you say something?	
Message	Shido	"Nothing, nothing at all!
I actually wanted to talk to you."	
Message	Kotori	What? Why are you changing the subject?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	None	"(I told Kotori that I told Origami everything,
and that it seemed like the AST was also
barely functional right now.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, what's with the loose lips? I'm shocked
to hear how easy you gave up this information."	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry.	
Message	Kotori	"Well... it's fine. Thanks to that, I may be able
to prevent AST's situation."	
Message	Shido	R-Really? Did you get any more information?	
Message	Kotori	"No. We were able to observe the Spirits' reaction
throughout Tengu City, but... that's all we know."	
Message	Shido	Is there no way to look into it further?	
Message	Kotori	"We would've if it was possible, but we can't
get a hold of headquarters so there's nothing
we can really do."	
Message	Kotori	"We're in the middle of a big phenomenon though.
And I think Tengu City is in the center of this big
change. That's all I can say for sure."	
Message	Shido	I see.	
Message	Kotori	Don't give me that look.	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, your job is to go on dates with Spirits and
stabilize them. If a girl dates a guy with the face
you're wearing, they'll only feel worse."	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I looked that glum, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Kinda. Although Origami Tobiichi isn't a spirit,
she's still pretty important. Continue to have her
on your list as well."	
Message	Kotori	"We'll figure out the whole mystery so you just continue
to be yourself, or else you'll get yourself in a worse bind."	
Message	Shido	G-Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"And if she gives you more information, you report
it to me immediately."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Rinne	Alright, I'll be borrowing your kitchen then.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sorry for the trouble all the time.	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you promised not to say that, right?
Next door neighbors help each other out, after all."	
Message	Shido	"Of course. If there's ever anything I can help with
at your house Rinne, you can always ask me."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, Shido. But I don't think there's anything right now?	
Message	Shido	It's true, you do have it together, Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	...Is that so? I hope so...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	It's nothing. Alright then, I'll prepare things quickly.	
Message	Shido	Alright, I'll be watching the pot on my end. I'll leave that side to you.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Leave it to me.	
Message	Rinne	Today's meal is meat and potato stew.	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! This is quite the delicious smell!	
Message	Shido	Everyone's here, right? Then, let's eat!	
Message	Tohka	Yes!  Let us eat!	
Message	Kotori	Yeah! Time to eat!	
Message	Yoshino	L...Let's eat!	
Message	Tohka	It's fluffy and delicious, Shido...!	
Message	Shido	You're right, this is definitely a motherly flavor.	
Message	Tohka	Motherly flavor?	
Message	Rinne	Umm...I guess you could say it means, a nostalgic sort of taste?	
Message	Shido	That's right. I wonder why, the taste is reassuring.	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm. I see...
Then I must aim for a motherly taste when I cook!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? You, cooking...?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I can do something like cooking too, Shido.
I make such things like cookies occasionally too..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's right. Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Tohka-chan, would you like seconds?	
Message	Tohka	Yes Rinne, please!	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you're welcome.
Don't rush too much and spill it."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Leave it to me!	
Message	Shido	Good grief...
