Message	None	"(We escaped from the collapsing Neo Tengu Tower,
and when we came to, we were at Takadai Park.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka and the others were recovered by the
Fraxinus, most likely for an examination. Kurumi
disappeared, and Origami returned to AST's base.)"	
Message	None	(And so... I was left alone, crushed by despair.)	
Message	None	"(That's right. In the end, Rinne had disappeared.
The ending I believed in never came. There was
no easy way out, no happy ending.)"	
Message	None	"(In the end, I didn't understand anything.
 Why she had created a barrier.
 And why she had tried to kill me.)"	
Message	None	(It all ended, everything left in mystery.)	
Message	Reine	...Are you alright, Shin?	
Message	Shido	No, it's still getting to me.	
Message	Reine	"Hm, I see. Then, perhaps I should find another
time to discuss today's occurrence with you?"	
Message	Shido	...Have you learned something?!	
Message	Reine	"That's right. Just now, when control of the
barrier left Ruler's hands... we were finally
able to analyze the barrier."	
Message	Shido	"R-Really?! Please tell me!
What on earth was that barrier?!"	
Message	Reine	......	
Message	Shido	Reine-san!	
Message	Reine	"This may not necessarily be the best news
for you. Even so, do you wish to know?"	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(For a moment, I flinched at Reine's intimidating
words. But it's inevitable. If I can find out what
Rinne was thinking, or even get closer to her...)"	
Message	Shido	Please, go ahead.	
Message	Reine	"Mm. If you're prepared, then I will respect
your wishes."	
Message	Reine	"Firstly, I will tell you that Ruler was an
existence similar yet different to a Spirit."	
Message	Shido	She wasn't... a Spirit?	
Message	Reine	"No. However, I cannot say definitively that she
is an altogether different entity."	
Message	Reine	"We won't know the details until we investigate
further, but... signs point to her being the
remnants of a powerful, spiritual energy."	
Message	Shido	What does that mean...?	
Message	Reine	"It may be easier to understand if I said that
she has no vessel. Normally when Spirits are
sealed, the vessel remains. Ruler, however..."	
Message	Shido	...would disappear, without a body.	
Message	Reine	Correct. It is unfortunate...	
Message	Shido	"No, it's fine. Please continue. What about
the barrier?"	
Message	None	"(If I hear too much, I'd end up remembering
what just happened, and it'll be too painful.
I returned to the original topic.)"	
Message	Reine	"From our conclusions, the barrier covering all
of Tengu City, Eden, aside from keeping all of
us trapped, had another special power."	
Message	Shido	A special... power. Like everyone's Angels...?	
Message	Reine	"Yes, something close to that. Although...
On a completely different scale."	
Message	Shido	Exactly what kind of power is in this barrier...?	
Message	Reine	Mm. Eden's power... is...	
Message	Reine	...the power to redo the world.	
Message	Shido	R-Redo the world...?	
Message	None	(What does that mean? It's a little tough to grasp...)	
Message	Reine	"It's as I said. Existing within the barrier is a
power to restart the world as many times as
needed until a desired outcome is obtained."	
Message	Reine	"That is Eden's power. You have fragments of
memories yourself, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	Ah...	
Message	None	(Once she told me, I realized.)	
Message	None	"(I... No. Not just me. Everyone else had
definitely remembered.)"	
Message	Shido	"I... remember. It's vague though. Memories
spent with Tohka and Origami... are there.
Could it be? Are they...?!"	
Message	Reine	"Yes. They most likely happened. Possibilities you
chose, inside of Eden's iterations. Endings that
could have been, born of the world repeating."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(All of that. Are you telling me it actually
happened? The memories feel too vivid to be
dreams or delusions. They definitely exist.)"	
Message	None	"(But... there's still one thing that I don't
know. I understand that the barrier holds
unbelievable power, but...)"	
Message	Shido	"Ruler... Rinne, what was her reason for
creating the barrier?"	
Message	Reine	That is...	
Message	Reine	"From here on, I am offering only suppositions.
Please understand that this answer is not an
absolute truth."	
Message	Shido	R...Right.	
Message	Reine	Restarting the world, with a caveat.	
Message	Shido	A caveat? What was it?	
Message	Reine	"The current version of the world suddenly ends and
reverts to its original state. Several patterns
emerged, but we found one absolute condition."	
Message	Reine	"In short, when a ""certain something"" occurs,
the world rewinds to its original state."	
Message	Shido	A... certain something? What is that...?	
Message	None	(Why is... my heart pounding so fast?)	
Message	Reine	Yes. The condition to restart the world... is...	
Message	Reine	Shin. It would be... your death.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	None	(Death...? Did she say... my death?)	
Message	None	"(I don't understand. What is Reine-san saying?
After all, I...)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(That's right. That time, and that time, and the
other times... Having lost Kotori's healing power,
there were a few times I ended up... dead.)"	
Message	None	"(I... had been redoing it, over and over again.
 Almost like repeatedly saving and loading,
over, and over!)"	
Message	Shido	When I died, the world would... start over?	
Message	Reine	"Yes. The moment you died, the world would return
to the day the barrier was created. Shin, you were
the key to this world."	
Message	Shido	"P...Please wait a second! Me, the key... why the
heck would that be?!"	
Message	Shido	"First of all, Ruler—er, Rinne tried to kill me,
didn't she? Because of that, I lost the spiritual
energy sealed inside of me—"	
Message	Reine	"Incorrect. The premise was... incorrect, from
the beginning."	
Message	Shido	Incorrect? What... do you mean?	
Message	Reine	"...Shin, do you remember Tohka losing control
a while ago?"	
Message	Shido	Tohka... losing control?	
Message	Reine	"Correct. Tohka had suddenly lost control of her
powers atop the school's rooftop. Do you not
remember?"	
Message	None	(Losing control... on the rooftop?)	
Message	Shido	"Wha?! That's right... When that happened, I
got caught up in the blast, and—!"	
Message	Reine	"...That's right. Most likely, Eden activated
around that time."	
Message	Shido	H-How do you know?	
Message	Reine	"...It must have, otherwise you may have
ended up dead then."	
Message	Shido	E-Ended up dead?	
Message	Reine	"Until recently, you were affected by poor
health, weren't you? Before Tohka and the
other Spirits lost control, that is."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, yeah. I mostly can't feel it anymore now...
But when I was examined on the Fraxinus,
there weren't any abnormalities, right?"	
Message	Reine	"It's true that nothing looked wrong.
However, an abnormality was occurring.
Along with a threat we didn't know of."	
Message	Shido	"Something even the Fraxinus didn't know...
What is that?"	
Message	Reine	"This is mere speculation, but rather than the
Spirits, it may have been you that was close to
losing control."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Reine	"Since you met the Spirits, your day-to-day has
become arduous. Tension and stress caused by dates
with the Spirits. Risking your life in battle."	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait just a second! What are you saying,
Reine-san? It's almost like you're saying—"	
Message	Reine	"―Yes. It's only a guess, but it's possible the
barrier wasn't the reason the spiritual energy
within your body returned to the Spirits."	
Message	Reine	"There is a high probability that your sudden
illness combined with various other factors,
accidentally caused this irregularity."	
Message	Shido	Then, that means...	
Message	None	"(The cause of the Spirit energy's return
wasn't the barrier...?)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne's barrier was created at the same time
as when Tohka lost control.)"	
Message	None	"(Eden's power was to restart the world, so...
my death is the catalyst for activating it.)"	
Message	None	(The dots... were finally beginning to connect.)	
Message	Shido	C-Could it be...? R...Rinne...	
Message	Reine	"Where the girl Rinne Sonogami appeared from,
or what sort of connection she has to you, I have
no idea. One thing for sure, however, is..."	
Message	None	"(The spiritual power sealed within me... All of
it returned to the Spirits. Of course, Kotori's
Flame of Regeneration as well.)"	
Message	None	"(In that state, I was... pretty close to dying,
and Tohka, Kotori, Yoshino all had their powers
return. Even Origami, and the ever-wicked Kurumi.)"	
Message	None	"(Between how dangerous that was... the memory
of dying so many times, and the world restarting,
the proof is all there.)"	
Message	Shido	Ah... Aahh...	
Message	None	"(Rinne... Rinne wasn't the one causing the
Spirits to lose control...)"	
Message	None	"(She hadn't even been trapping us for any
selfish reason...!)"	
Message	None	(She did it for my sake...!)	
Message	None	"(All while she was chipping away at herself...
To save me from dying, having lost the Flame
of Regeneration, she was saving me!)"	
Message	Shido	Ri...nne...	
Message	Reine	"That's correct. Ruler, Rinne Sonogami, created
this world solely... in order to protect you."	
Message	Shido	Ahh... Ah, aaahhh...	
Message	Shido	"I...I... knew... absolutely nothing...
And I... went and... to Rinne... I... I...!"	
Message	Reine	Please, go no further than that, Shin.	
Message	Shido	...Reine...san...?	
Message	Reine	"Of course, it doesn't matter if anyone despised or
pitied her. However, Shin. For you, only you. She
sacrificed her life to protect you. Never forget."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Reine	"Please, Shin. Rinne Sonogami simply tried to save
you. If you wish to repay her, then... please.
Instead of regret or apologies, give thanks."	
Message	Shido	Y...Yes.	
Message	Reine	"Mm, you seem all right. Then, I'll hand this
over to you."	
Message	Shido	Huh? This is...	
Message	Reine	"When you were all escaping from Neo Tengu Tower,
it got mixed in somehow. There seems to be
something inside, but... any idea what it is?"	
Message	None	(Even if you ask me, I don't have any...)	
Message	Rinne	I'll take good care of it.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	"Reine-san, um, could you... give me some time
for a little bit?"	
Message	Reine	...Hmm?	
Message	Reine	"I understand. No need to explain. However,
Eden's barrier will soon disappear completely,
and the world will return to its original state."	
Message	Reine	"If you have any unfinished business, do it
quickly. Then, let us meet again, Shin."	
Message	Shido	Yes, thank you.	
Message	None	"In the end, Rinne and I shared one last date.
Even though it was only in my dreams."	
Message	None	"The time we spent cannot be recovered.
Rinne, who was by my side, is no longer
here."	
Message	None	"I opened the bag that Reine-san handed me.
As I had expected, there was a familiar key
inside."	
Message	None	"That's right. This was proof that Rinne was
my ""childhood friend"". The look on Rinne's face
when I handed it to her. Surprised, but elated."	
Message	None	"She was that panicked when she forgot it at
home, too..."	
Message	Shido	"Didn't you promise you'd take care of it, Rinne?
Then, take responsibility. Take it with you!"	
Message	Shido	"Otherwise, I'll end up realizing how I won't have
you to wake me in the morning, or ask me how your
food tastes, that I'll no longer see your smile!"	
Message	Shido	"Why... Why?! You said... You said we'd be
childhood friends forever... that you wanted
to be together!"	
Message	Shido	RINNEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!	
Message	Rinne	Thank you, Shido. The time I spent together\nwith you... was my only true happiness.	
Message	Tamae	"Okaaay! Homeroom is now over. Everyone,
please be careful heading home."	
Message	Shido	Hey Tohka, let's go home.	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	Shido	I feel kind of under the weather...	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Are you all right, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Ah... I might just have a cold. More importantly,
I'm glad you're fine, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Apologies, Shido... I am glad you are all right.	
Message	Shido	"No, don't worry for my sake. Luckily things have
calmed down properly."	
Message	None	"(Tohka almost lost control of her powers on the
rooftop. However, perhaps because Tohka did well
to endure it, things didn't get out of control.)"	
Message	None	"(Even if she lost control, it was slight, and
Kotori said there wasn't any damage. We were
able to avoid the worst. What a relief...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hrm...	
Message	Shido	"Come on, don't look so depressed. It's times
like these when you need to smile."	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	Right, just like that.	
Message	Shido	...Hey, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Doesn't... something feel weird?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what does? I am perfectly fine.	
Message	Shido	"No no. Something about this view, the city...
Like something's missing... In fact, was it
always like this?"	
Message	Tohka	...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, hmm. For example, over there by the train
station, something apart from the Tengu Tower...
wasn't there a big building of some sort?"	
Message	Tohka	Hm, was there...?	
Message	Shido	"I see. Maybe not. Sorry for asking such a strange
question. Well, whatever. Do you want to stop by
somewhere?"	
Message	Tohka	Really?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Anywhere you want.	
Message	Tohka	I see! Then Shido, let's go!	
Message	Shido	Ah, hey! Wait up! Tohka?!	
Message	Shido	"*sigh* Jeez, but, what is it? I feel like...
I'm forgetting one more very important thing."	
Message	Shido	"Something really important to me...
Something I shouldn't forget..."	
Message	Tohka	Heeeey! Shido, hurry! Over here!	
Message	Shido	Ah, right! I'm going now!	
Message	None	"(Well, it's probably fine if I don't think on it
too much.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm sure I'll remember eventually.
If it's something important to me, I'm sure...)"	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Rinne	"Everyone... has forgotten... No, it no longer
happened. I, the foreign object, have vanished
from this world, and normalcy has returned."	
Message	Rinne	It was... It was best this way, right Shido?	
Message	Rinne	...?	
Message	Rinne	You... are...	
Message	???	Good work. You fulfilled your role splendidly.	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	???	At last, sleep well...	
Message	None	"[205: A Small Miracle] has been added to MEMORY.
A small miracle, which may have occurred..."
