Message	Shido	*pant, pant*... Phew, finally made it.	
Message	Tohka	Shido! We arrived earlier than we thought!	
Message	Rinne	Right. What a relief, but now we're so sweaty.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. My back's sticky. It feels gross. Now that
my body's cooling down, I'm starting to shiver."	
Message	Rinne	"Hey, Shido. Make sure not to catch a cold.
You've just finally gotten better."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... You're right. I'll be careful.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Shido, have you fallen ill again?	
Message	Shido	Oh... I'm fine. Don't worry, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	"Well, as long as you're okay! If you fall ill,
you had better say something immediately,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Got it.	
Message	Rinne	Hehehe. Oh, Tohka-chan.	
Message	Shido	"(If I don't want to worry Tohka, I have to do
whatever it takes not to catch a cold...)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! We arrived earlier than we thought!	
Message	Rinne	"What's wrong with you, Shido? You're drenched
in sweat."	
Message	Shido	"Um... I left home late. Did you make it to
practice in time?"	
Message	Rinne	Ummm... I was close.	
Message	Shido	Close?	
Message	Rinne	...But I was late. Haha...	
Message	Shido	Ah, I had a feeling... Sorry about that, Rinne.	
Message	Tohka	Aw... Don't worry. It's my fault, isn't it?	
Message	Rinne	"No, it's not, Tohka-chan! I enjoy spending time
with you and Shido. I have to accept the blame.
I wasn't paying attention to the time."	
Message	Rinne	Don't let it get to you... Okay?	
Message	Tohka	Okay... Thank you for always taking care of me.	
Message	Shido	"You say that, but... Rinne, I feel like you
should have a little more time to yourself."	
Message	Rinne	"Hmm. Well, I'm only doing what feels natural
though."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, I know I'm not one to talk, but you should
try limiting your need to care for others—"	
Message	Tonomachi	YAH!	
Message	Shido	OOW!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yo, you seem pretty energetic for someone
who only just recovered!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, that hurt, Tonomachi! What the hell?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"What do you mean what am I doing?
Showing you some love, obviously."	
Message	Shido	"Since when was a dropkick an expression
of love?!"	
Message	Tohka	Drop?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Because! You've got Tohka-chan and Rinne-chan
tagging alongside you in the morning. I was hot
with jealousy... *sniff*..."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's your own damn problem! Since
when are you so sensitive, anyway?"	
Message	None	"(He's Hiroto Tonomachi. A friend of mine who
holds some of my biggest secrets. Except for
the Spirits, that is.)"	
Message	None	"(Every time a girl approaches me, he asks me to
hook her up with him. It gets annoying, but he's
a good guy. We do go way back after all...)"	
Message	Rinne	You two are so close.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh yeah?! You think so too, Rinne-chan?
Guess I might have to date Itsuka-kun then!"	
Message	Shido	"Only in your wildest dreams! Stop grabbing
onto me! That's gross!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Aw, don't be like that, Itsuka. Didn't you hear
that the Fujoshis ranked us the 2nd-cutest
couple in school?"	
Message	Shido	I heard, but I'd rather forget!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Shido... Is there something going on between
you and Tonomachi?!"	
Message	Shido	NO! NOTHING'S GOING ON! THERE'S NO WAY!	
Message	Tohka	Oh... I see.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Aww. Cold. Cold-blooded, Itsuka-kun. It breaks
my heart to see you act like it meant nothing
to you. You go through men like dirty rags!"	
Message	Shido	"CUT IT OUT ALREADY! Everyone's looking at us
weird!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"NAHAHAHA! Stop worrying! It doesn't faze me
one bit!"	
Message	Shido	Well, it should! Forget it, go home everyone!	
Message	Tonomachi	"I can't go home... Itsuka, did you see the news
this morning?"	
Message	Shido	Hm? Just for a sec... Why do you ask?	
Message	None	(The conversation took a visible turn.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"You know how pets have gone missing all over
Tengu City, and now the news is all over it?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. What about it?	
Message	Tonomachi	Supposedly... It's the curse of the Tengu Cow.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Curse of the Tengu Cow? What's that?	
Message	Tonomachi	"A loooooong time ago, before Tengu City was
even a thought..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"There lived a monster, with two cowhorns and a
long snout, near a village on top of a mountain."	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Tonomachi	"The villagers began calling this nasty beast
the Tengu Cow..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Whenever the Tengu Cow came out to feed, it
snuck into the village to devour the livestock
and young children, frightening the villagers..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... Was there no one who could vanquish this
so-called Tengu Cow?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Nope. Villagers feared that the entire village
would be eaten by the Tengu Cow. They held
numerous discussions, but they did nothing."	
Message	Tohka	Oh...	
Message	None	(Wow. Sounds like total bull to me.)	
Message	Tonomachi	"One hot day in June, a samurai wandered into
their village. He was so noble and courageous,
vowing to ease the villagers' fears."	
Message	Tohka	...!	
Message	Tonomachi	"The samurai devised a plan, advising the
villagers to leave the Tengu Cow to him."	
Message	Tonomachi	"He instructed the villagers to gather all of the
alcohol in the village, then to lock themselves
at home. He then waited alone for the Tengu Cow."	
Message	Tonomachi	"On June 11th, the Tengu Cow emerged once
more to the village."	
Message	Shido	You know the date?	
Message	Tonomachi	"There are records of the date. Like the
samurai's will..."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	Will? What's that?	
Message	Shido	"Um... It's like a letter of intent someone
writes before they die."	
Message	Tohka	What...? The samurai's going to die?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Now, don't be so impatient. The villagers hid in
their homes. No one made a peep. The samurai
saw the Tengu Cow, and invited it for a drink."	
Message	Tonomachi	"At first, the Tengu Cow was shocked. It never
met a human that wasn't afraid of it, and it
accepted his offer to drink."	
Message	Tonomachi	"As they drank together, the Tengu Cow let
its guard down, recognizing the kindness in the
old samurai, and it began to open up."	
Message	Tonomachi	"It was something not even the samurai could've
anticipated."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Little did he know that the Tengu Cow actually
had a good heart. It only appeared in the area
because humans had driven it from its mountain."	
Message	Tohka	Oh... I sort of know where it's coming from.	
Message	None	(Oh man. She's glued to his story...)	
Message	Tonomachi	"So... The original plan was to get the Tengu Cow
drunk, tie it up, then drown it in the lake, but
the samurai decided to drink with it instead."	
Message	Tonomachi	"There's that phrase You are the company you keep"", so the samurai asked the Tengu Cow if it would travel the world with him."""	
Message	Tohka	OHHHH! What a brilliant idea!	
Message	Tonomachi	"That's right. The Tengu Cow was so moved by his
invitation that it couldn't hide its surprise.
Who could blame him? It was unbelievable!"	
Message	Tonomachi	But I've got such a big appetite. Is that okay?\nMy hideous looks make traveling with me\nnothing but trouble. Are you sure?	
Message	Tonomachi	"The beast hunched over, curling its back as it
offered its question timidly, but the samurai
reached out his hand and said, Come with me."""""	
Message	Tohka	?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"The Tengu Cow cried its eyes out and took his
hand."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hey, don't grab my hand too tightly, cried the\nsamurai. ""I'll break,"" and the two shared hefty\nlaughter."	
Message	Shido	"What's up with the sob story? It's not like
anyone would cry about such a dumb—"	
Message	Tohka	U...u...u... UWAAAAAH!	
Message	Shido	WHAAAAAAAAAAT?!	
Message	Tohka	*sniff, sniff* What a beautiful tale...	
Message	None	(Does she really think so...? I-I don't know...)	
Message	Shido	"So, what does the curse of the Tengu Cow have
anything to do with it?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Now now, Itsuka-chan. You gotta work for it
before I give it to you."	
Message	Shido	Whoa. Come on, don't take it there.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Itsuka-kun, calm down. This is where things
take a turn."	
Message	None	"(...I'm starting to think being Tonomachi's
classmate is the real curse.)"	
Message	Tohka	Huh...?	
Message	Tonomachi	"The Tengu Cow and the samurai were beyond
drunk by this point, and the beast fell asleep.
Then..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"The villagers slowly left their houses to gather
around the Tengu Cow. Then, they began to tie
it up, following the samurai's original plan."	
Message	Tohka	Wha? Couldn't the samurai have done anything?	
Message	Tonomachi	"He pleaded with the villagers, of course, saying
that things had changed, but several of the
villagers lost family members to the Tengu Cow."	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Fire burned in the villagers' eyes, and as the
samurai begged them to stop, they tied him up
to a nearby pillar."	
Message	Tonomachi	"The samurai could only scream as he watched
the villagers drag the Tengu Cow towards the
lake."	
Message	Tonomachi	"They hopped aboard a raft the samurai had
advised to build, attached weights to the
Tengu Cow, and tossed it right into the lake."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Then, from the bottom lake, they heard a
horrific scream, GROOOOOO!"" It echoed all around the area."""	
Message	Tonomachi	"Since then, the Tengu Cow was never seen
again..."	
Message	Tohka	That is horrible!	
Message	Tonomachi	"When all was said and done, they untied the
samurai, and he felt the same horror that you
do..."	
Message	Tonomachi	"On his will, he wrote, The real monster lives elsewhere,"" and he slaughtered all of the villagers and drowned himself in the lake."""	
Message	Tohka	...	
Message	Tonomachi	"It rained every day for a month afterwards, like
the heavens shed tears from the clouds. They
say the village was completely submerged."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Itsuka, you know the lake north of the train
station? Supposedly, the Tengu Cow sleeps
at the bottom of that lake."	
Message	Tonomachi	"A shrine sits near the lake in order to appease
the Tengu Cow's spirit, and on June 11th, people
must give it offerings."	
Message	Shido	What? I've never heard that.	
Message	Rinne	Unfortunately, neither have I...?	
Message	Tonomachi	"*Ahem*! Itsuka-kun, Rinne-chan, you don't
even know the history of your own town? You
two have a long way to go."	
Message	Shido	Just where the hell do you get off?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Listen to me. Tengu City got its name from
the Tengu Cow, just so people never forgot
about what transpired."	
Message	Tonomachi	"It's our responsibility to atone for the pain
that the Tengu Cow experienced."	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	None	"(Who would even believe that story...? It wasn't
just long, it was annoying. The fact he's so
proud of it annoys me even more.)"	
Message	Rinne	If what you said was true, then how sad...	
Message	Shido	HEY RINNE! Not you, too!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh and as a sidenote, if you flip over the kanji
for the date, June 11th, it looks like two horns
and a long snout. Just like the Tengu, right?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Kinda spooky. It looks like the Tengu Cow
after it was thrown into the lake."	
Message	Shido	Uh. That's such an obvious afterthought.	
Message	Tonomachi	If only it ended there...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	"The 11... If you combine the kanji for ten and
one, it resembles the kanji for samurai""."""	
Message	Tohka	Wow!	
Message	Rinne	Wow!	
Message	Tonomachi	Gives you chills... doesn't it?	
Message	Shido	Uh, sounds a little forced to me...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Everyone, just like Itsuka, forgot about the
offerings, so I think the Tengu Cow is rising
from the dead, eating everyone's pets!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"We gotta do somethin' about the curse!
Wouldn't ya say, Itsuka-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Hey Tonomachi, come closer!	
Message	Tonomachi	OH! Are you finally confessing your love to me?!	
Message	Shido	NEVER! JUST GET OVER HERE!	
Message	Tonomachi	AAH! Hey, don't blow in my ear!	
Message	Shido	"Just shut up a second! Jeez... What was all
that about? Is that whole legend true?"	
Message	Tonomachi	Oh, no.	
Message	Shido	"I knew you were lying... You'd better apologize.
I won't let you get away with this."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Now, now. Leave it to me! Let's make this
summer one to remember!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"With that said, after consulting with Itsuka,
in order to prevent the curse, I wanna deliver
some offerings to the shrine of the Tengu Cow!"	
Message	Shido	"What?! Who said I'd do that?! No one's
going with you—"	
Message	Tohka	Well done, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tohka	Surely the Tengu Cow has been furious!	
Message	Shido	Uh, Tohka. That was all Tonomachi's...	
Message	Tonomachi	Amazing, Tohka-chan! You're a sweetheart!	
Message	Tohka	"Of course! Let's all do our part to appease the
Tengu Cow!"	
Message	Origami	If Shido's going, I'm going, too.	
Message	Shido	Origami?! Where'd you come from?!	
Message	Tohka	"Grr. Hello, you harpy. What cat dragged you
here?"	
Message	Rinne	"Okay, okay... Let's all relax. If everyone else
is going, then I'll go too. Sounds fun."	
Message	Shido	Not you too, Rinne.	
Message	Tonomachi	"All right. It's settled. Tonight, we're meeting
at the haunted hou—er, to drop off our
offerings at the lake!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Like my plan, Itsuka? Haunted houses are the
best in summer! That's where you-know-what
happens! Tonight, we become men!"	
Message	Shido	Sounds like you've got it all figured out!	
Message	Tonomachi	Oh, please. You're making me blush!	
Message	Shido	That was sarcasm!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, right. Go invite Kotori. The more girls,
the merrier!"	
Message	Shido	"Even if I brought her with me, I'd never
introduce you to her!"	
Message	Tonomachi	C'mon, future brother-in-law!	
Message	Shido	Don't ever say that again! Disgusting!	
Message	None	(How did we end up in this predicament?)	
Message	Tohka	Shido, what is this offering you speak of?	
Message	None	(Damn... I knew she'd ask.)	
Message	Shido	"I'm gonna assume flowers or food of some kind,
something the Tengu Cow would like. Then, we
can offer our prayers at the shrine, cool?"	
Message	Tohka	Ah, I see.	
Message	Rinne	Tohka-chan, what are you planning to take?	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm. Nothing's come to mind yet. What do you
propose, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	"Hmm. I wonder what would be appropriate
as an offering for a situation like this."	
Message	None	(...Is this really happening?)	
Message	Shido	"Hey Origami, you sure about this? Don't
feel obligated to come along."	
Message	Origami	It's fine. This is my chance...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	To do you-know-what. Hehehe.	
Message	Shido	Is that what you want out of this?!	
Message	Origami	"Hopefully it would take me a step further
than how arranged dates have gone for me."	
Message	Shido	What...? What do you mean by a step further?	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... You were talking about those dates.
Sorry for being so busy."	
Message	Origami	It's okay. I enjoyed your warm presence, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Uh, Origami? I think you're mistak—	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Tamae	"Hello hello, everyone. Please be seated.
It's time for homeroom to begin."	
Message	None	"(That's Tamae Okamine, a.k.a. Tama-chan,
our social studies teacher who doubles as our
homeroom advisor. She's quite adorable.)"	
Message	Tamae	"Greetings, everyone. Good morning to you all.
We're scheduled to begin testing, but how are
everyone's studies going?"	
Message	Tamae	"Itsuka, I know you've been absent so you've
got a lot on your plate, but good luck."	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay...	
Message	Tamae	"Unfortunately, I have some bad news
regarding the sports festival that was
scheduled for tomorrow..."	
Message	None	"(That's right. I've been out for a while, so I'm
pretty far behind. Testing's gonna be rough. I
wonder if Rinne or Origami could tutor me.)"	
Message	None	"(In fact, do I even have time to see this stupid
haunted house?)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe it had just been a while, but I
couldn't keep up with class.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Time for lunch!	
Message	Origami	Shido, come with me.	
Message	Tohka	"Hey! Origami Tobiichi, I was the first to invite
him!"	
Message	Origami	"It doesn't matter who spoke first. I can't
trust you to care for Shido, who's still
recovering."	
Message	Tohka	"GRRRR! Shido will be just fine with me!
I even wiped the sweat from his brow!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Tohka! What are you telling people in
class?!"	
Message	Origami	Well, I had to stick a thermometer in his—	
Message	Shido	STOP! Origami, STOP!	
Message	Origami	"If you insist Shido, I guess I can save this
story for another time. But sooner or later,
the truth will come out."	
Message	Shido	Well, um, I... don't remember too much.	
Message	Tohka	"Hehe... Well, I wiped Shido's body from head
to toe!"	
Message	Shido	Tohka! You're exaggerating!	
Message	Origami	"...I knew that's all it was.
That all you've got?"	
Message	Tohka	"Huh? How do you mean ""that's all it was""?"	
Message	Origami	"I wouldn't have wiped his sweat. With all
the sweat Shido emits, I would—"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait. Origami?!
What are you talking about?!"	
Message	Origami	I'm talking about how to care for you.	
Message	Shido	"Just don't spread rumors about something
that didn't happen, okay?!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"*sigh* Here we go again. Another morning where
Pretty Boi Itsuka is surrounded by girls!"	
Message	Shido	Enough with the nicknames!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Come on, don't be so upset. You'll wrinkle
that sex animal face of yours."	
Message	Shido	"WHO'S GOT A SEX ANIMAL FACE?! What does
that even mean?!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Chill out. Jokes aside, let's hurry up and
get some grub. We can eat together, too!
Let's head to the cafeteria already!"	
Message	Origami	Shido, hurry. All of the seats will be taken.	
Message	Tohka	"Fear not, Shido. I'll be sure to save you a
seat."	
Message	Tonomachi	Um... What's the point of my existence? *sniff*	
Message	Shido	Tonomachi, you know...	
Message	Tonomachi	Oh, what is it, Itsuka? My dear friend.	
Message	Shido	You're gross.	
Message	Tonomachi	Agh!	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah... Jury's still out on your personality,
too."	
Message	Tonomachi	GUOOO!	
Message	Shido	"Well, let's get going. Rinne, you're coming
with, right?"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, um... I—	
Message	Tohka	SHIDO! The seats are filling!	
Message	Shido	Coming! Rinne, let's go!	
Message	Rinne	"Um... I think I'll refrain for today. I brought
lunch."	
Message	Shido	"Can't you take your lunch to the cafeteria
and eat it there? Tons of people do that."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, but... I'll refrain for today.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	"(Did I see Rinne hiding two lunch boxes behind
her back? Or was it just my imagination?)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, do you have plans with someone already?
If so, then sorry for springing this on you."	
Message	Rinne	"Huh?! Oh, not at all! It's not like that...
Sorry."	
Message	Shido	Okay. Got it. Then, I'm gonna go eat lunch.	
Message	Rinne	Okay... Bye.	
Message	Shido	Okay, later.	
Message	Tonomachi	Man, Rinne-chan's one heck of a girl...	
Message	Shido	"What makes you say that? She wasn't acting
any different than usual."	
Message	Tonomachi	"But that's what makes her so amazing! She
gives off the perfect wife material"" vibe!"""	
Message	Shido	Give it a rest...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Don't you agree? Rinne-chan is the model
Japanese woman. Adorable, mindful, and
adorable."	
Message	Shido	"You said adorable"" twice... Well, I guess Rinne is pretty adorable."""	
Message	None	"(She's adorable, a great chef, kind, tidy, and
she loves taking care of people. We don't even
have to say anything for her to act adorably...)"	
Message	None	(...Whoa. Now I'm starting to sound like him.)	
Message	Shido	"Well, you've got a point. If you want to get
married, it'd be great to have a wife like
Rinne."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(Wh-Why does it look like Origami's
glaring at me?)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hey, Shido. So what is ""marriage""?"	
Message	Origami	"That's my and Shido's future. So, it's none of
your concern."	
Message	Tohka	WHAT?!	
Message	Shido	"Uh... It's a promise that two people make
when they love each other and want to be
together forever, I guess."	
Message	Tohka	Together... forever...	
Message	Shido	Hm. What's up, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Oh, nothing. It's just...	
Message	Shido	Oh.	
Message	None	"(Huh? What's going on? The air feels thick
all of a sudden...)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Carrots!	
Message	Origami	"Forget the carrots. You should try the pickled
daikon."	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait a minute! What's going on, you two?!	
Message	Tohka	"Nothing! We simply want you to eat your
vegetables, Shido!"	
Message	Origami	Vitamin C intake is important.	
Message	None	(NNNG!)	
Message	Tohka	Have some cucumbers too, Shido!	
Message	Origami	Eat celery for fiber!	
Message	None	S-Stop shoving vegetables down my throat!	
Message	Shido	MMM! MMMMGM!	
Message	Girl Student A	Oh goodness, what's going on over there?	
Message	Girl Student B	Maybe it's a new kind of foreplay?	
Message	Guy Student A	Well, that's one way to diet.	
Message	Guy Student B	"Damn it... DAMN IT! I want cute girls to shove
vegetables in my mouth!"	
Message	Guy Student A	"Looks like feeding is not only an animal
trait, but a human one as well."	
Message	Girl Student A	Look, he's practically pale now.	
Message	Girl Student B	He's happy.	
Message	Girl Student A	You think?	
Message	Girl Student B	That face looks desperate to me.	
Message	Shido	P...Ple...ase... O...o...rigami!	
Message	None	(I can't breathe... I can't...)	
Message	Origami	...Shido?!	
Message	Tohka	"SHIDO! Are you okay?! What's the matter,
Shido?!"	
Message	None	"(Tohka and Origami's voices were fading
in the distance...)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	(That's right. That sure was something...)	
Message	None	"(The direction of the clock's hands tell me that
it's time to go home. I slept so long, it seems
I'm the last one left in the classroom...)"	
Message	None	"(I appreciate Tohka and Origami's intentions,
but I wish they'd respect my personal space.
Though, that might be asking too much.)"	
Message	None	(Hm? Kotori?)	
Message	Shido	Yo, what's up, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"Right back at ya. What've you been up to?
I couldn't get ahold of you."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Well, stuff happened.	
Message	Kotori	"You upset Tohka again, didn't you?
Nice, real mature of you."	
Message	Shido	Ah! It's a long story, okay?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh. Boy, you're such a sad sack. If they
ranked the saddest sacks, you'd be number
one for sure!"	
Message	Shido	Leave me alone!	
Message	Kotori	"Well, if you had any game, Shido, it wouldn't
be this difficult to make the seal happen."	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Kotori	"Anyway... Remember what I told you?
Don't tell me you forgot."	
Message	Shido	I know. You want me... to go on a date, right?	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. If you stabilize the Spirit, then
that'll prevent her from going rogue. That's
the most important thing. For your sake, too."	
Message	Shido	I know.	
Message	Kotori	"Then hurry up and find the girls to do
what you need to do. Escort them, you
hear me?"	
Message	None	(Now... Where to go?)
