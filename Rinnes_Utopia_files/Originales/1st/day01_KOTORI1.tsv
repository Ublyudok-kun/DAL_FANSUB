Message	Shido	"Invite a Spirit out on a date, huh? Damn it,
Kotori. You're in the same predicament."	
Message	Shido	"She, too, is a Spirit, so there's a big chance
that whatever's going on is affecting her
as well."	
Message	Shido	"That's right; maybe I could invite Kotori out
on a date. Well, not a date per se. Just so I
could check up on her health."	
Message	Shido	"If I were to invite her on a date, I wonder how
she'd react. I've got butterflies in my stomach,
but here goes nothing."	
Message	Shido	"Hm, she's not picking up. Is Kotori currently
in the Fraxinus? Or..."	
Message	Shido	"School's out by now, so... maybe I should try
calling the house line."	
Message	Shido	"I can't get through to her. Hm. Reine should
be able to tell me Kotori's whereabouts."	
Message	Shido	Excuse me.	
Message	Reine	...Hello, Shin. Welcome.	
Message	Shido	Reine, I thought I'd find you here.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh... Shido? What's up? Did you miss seeing
Reine's chest?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, hey Kotori. You're here, too?	
Message	Kotori	Sure nice of you to notice.	
Message	Kotori	Am I unwanted here? If so, then I'll leave.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. Not at all. Quite the contrary,
actually."	
Message	Kotori	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"I've been looking for you, Kotori. I tried
calling your cell, but you didn't answer."	
Message	Kotori	"Huh...? Oh... My cellphone. I forgot it at
home."	
Message	Reine	You, forgetting something? That's unlike you.	
Message	Kotori	"I'm allowed to forget things from time to
time, you know."	
Message	Kotori	"So...? What do you want, Shido? Here to
ask for money from your little sister?"	
Message	Shido	"You're making me look like a bad
older brother, sheesh..."	
Message	Kotori	If that's not the case, then what is it?	
Message	Shido	"I could be here for any number of...
Okay, forget about it. Kotori, let's go on
a date."	
Message	Kotori	What...?	
Message	Kotori	Oh... Um... Wh-What's gotten into you?	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, you're the one who told me. About
having to go on dates with the Spirits."	
Message	Reine	"Hm... It's true. Kotori is a Spirit. Your logic
is sound."	
Message	Kotori	W-Well, that's not what I meant...	
Message	Kotori	"I-I meant to go on dates with other Spirits,
beside me!"	
Message	Shido	"It's not like you're in great shape either,
right? I mean, you forgetting something is
totally out of character for you."	
Message	Shido	"Besides, Spirit or not, you're my little sister.
It's only natural to want to be close with
your little sister."	
Message	Kotori	Ugh...	
Message	Reine	Why not go on a date with him?	
Message	Reine	"Look at it as an opportunity to prevent a Spirit
from going rogue. Kotori, live a little."	
Message	Kotori	I... I can't!	
Message	Shido	Huh?! Why?!	
Message	Reine	...She's not being honest with herself.	
Message	Kotori	"Um, don't worry about me! If you have to
worry about someone, then focus on
the other Spirits!"	
Message	Kotori	"Besides, I need to meet with Reine to discuss
what measures we need to take going forward."	
Message	Kotori	"So I don't have time to go on a date with you,
Shido!"	
Message	Reine	...I can just wait until later, though.	
Message	Kotori	"I-It's fine! Just focus on dating the other
Spirits, Shido! Now, go!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey!	
Message	Shido	"*sigh*... I guess I couldn't convince her.
Even if she says otherwise... I'm still worried
about her."	
Message	Shido	"Looks like, no matter what, she'd reject me
anyways... Hm, what to do..."	
Choice		Listen to Kotori.	
Choice		I still can't let it go.	
Message	Shido	"I guess I'll take Kotori's word for it and
invite someone else."	
Message	Shido	"I can't help but worry about Kotori.
Dating others seems like a distraction..."	
Message	Shido	I guess I'll just wait until Kotori's free.
