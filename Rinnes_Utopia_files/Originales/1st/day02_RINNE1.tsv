Message	None	"(Huh...? Where did Rinne go?
I thought she just walked out of the classroom, but...)"	
Message	None	"(In actuality, I should probably go on a date with Tohka
and the others, but... when I realized, I've been following
Rinne around with my eyes...)"	
Message	None	(...Why am I so concerned about her?)	
Message	None	(Oh, there she is. Hmm... Rinne?)	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	None	"(T-This doesn't seem the right mood to talk to her...
I wonder what's wrong?)"	
Message	None	"(No... Actually, I should invite her on a date, for a
change of pace... Rinne's always helping me out, so
I should help her out too when she's troubled.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rinne...!	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Shido...	
Message	Shido	Um... Well, you see―	
Message	Rinne	Could it be... an invitation to a date?	
Message	Shido	...! Y-You're correct...	
Message	Rinne	...Today too? But you should invite the other girls rather than me...	
Message	Shido	B-But―	
Message	Rinne	Oh, look. Speaking of which... Tobiichi-san!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	...What?	
Message	Rinne	It seems like Shido's looking for someone to go on a date with.	
Message	Origami	I see. Then it's decided that it will be me.	
Message	Shido	Wait wait wait...	
Message	Origami	...You don't want to?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? 	
Message	Origami	Then, it's decided you'll go with me.	
Message	Shido	Wait, hang on.	
Message	Origami	This has already been decided. It cannot be overturned.	
Message	Shido	*sigh*...	
Message	Rinne	All right, you two go on ahead...	
Message	Origami	Are you not coming as well, Rinne Sonogami?	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"That was how I had understood the agreement.
Of course, I wouldn't be opposed to Shido and me
being alone. In fact, that would be preferable."	
Message	Shido	N-No, you're not wrong, all three of us! Right?	
Message	Rinne	Huh? B-But...	
Message	Shido	"Rinne! I feel like I'm in danger if I'm alone with Origami,
so p-please!"	
Message	Rinne	"...I-If you say that to me Shido, then I'm weak...
 All right, I'll go then, okay?"	
Message	Shido	All right! Then it's decided!	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(Maybe that was a little forceful, but I was somehow
able to make it into a three-person date with Rinne
and Origami.)"	
Message	Rinne	So then, what should we do?	
Message	Shido	...Um, is there any place you'd like to go?	
Message	Rinne	Um, could it be, you hadn't thought of anything?	
Message	Shido	Oogh, w-well, yeah...	
Message	Rinne	...Good grief, Shido. That's a bad habit, you know?	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Origami	I will follow you anywhere.	
Message	Shido	Then, um...	
Message	None	(In the end, nothing brilliant would come to mind...)	
Message	None	"(Since a test was coming close, and with my suggestion
that we study, we ended up going to Origami's house.)"	
Message	Origami	Please, come in.	
Message	Shido	P-Please excuse us...	
Message	Rinne	So this is your apartment, Tobiichi-san? It's very clean.	
Message	Origami	I only have the bare minimum that I need.	
Message	Rinne	It must be tough living alone...	
Message	Origami	"It's all right, I've gotten used to it.
For now, just relax."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Thank you, Origami.	
Message	Origami	Oh...	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Origami?	
Message	Origami	...Nothing. It's probably just my imagination.	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Origami	Wait a moment. Once I change, I'll prepare tea.	
Message	Shido	Ah, right, don't worry about us...	
Message	None	(...? Origami was a little weird just now―)	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Rinne	...Shido? What's wrong?	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? Er, uh... it's nothing.
F-For now, let's just sit somewhere around here."	
Message	Rinne	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Origami	Here you go.	
Message	Shido	Thanks.	
Message	Rinne	Thank you.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Origami...	
Message	Origami	What?	
Message	Shido	"This might be a weird thing to ask, but...
This is the first time we've studied for a test together, right?"	
Message	Origami	...I was thinking of asking you the same thing.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"So you too felt the same feeling of deja vu, Shido?
This might be serious..."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. If it was only one of us, then it could
just be misremembering, but..."	
Message	Origami	We've studied together here before.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, most likely...	
Message	Rinne	H-Hey, you two? What's wrong all of a sudden?	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Rinne	"Tobiichi-san went through the trouble of making us tea,
so let's talk while we drink it, okay?"	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Origami	...Sorry, excuse me for a moment.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami? Where are you going?	
Message	Origami	To clip some flowers.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry.	
Message	Origami	It's all right...	
Message	Shido	Whew...	
Message	None	"(Yesterday, and today, there've been so many weird things
happening. Could it be some sort of harbinger? Or could it
have something to do with the barrier Kotori's investigating?)"	
Message	Rinne	...Shido? Are you okay?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Wha! Hey-! W-W-W-What's going on, Rinne?!	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, you don't seem well, and your face is pale...
You might have a fever."	
Message	Shido	"Huh, what...?!  What're you saying? I-I'm fine!
I don't have a fever! What's wrong, Rinne?!"	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee. What do you mean, what's wrong...?
Checking you for a fever by touching foreheads...
We used to do it in the past all the time, right?"	
Message	Shido	D-Did we do that...?	
Message	Rinne	Did you forget...?	
Message	Shido	"No, I mean, we may have done it...
But since we're in school―"	
Message	Rinne	"It'll be over soon, okay? You're a good kid, so
close your eyes..."	
Message	Shido	"Wait! But, you know!
I-If Origami comes back, what on earth will she say―"	
Message	None	(More importantly, if I closed my eyes now, it looks like you'll kiss me!)	
Message	Rinne	Don't worry, Tobiichi-san won't come back for a while...	
Message	Shido	...Huh?	
Message	Rinne	So, here, come on?	
Message	Shido	Ah...	
Message	None	(Wh-What is this feeling...?)	
Message	None	"(My head feels cold... I feel calmer somehow...
It's like, something is falling away―)"	
Message	Shido	―!?	
Message	Rinne	...Ah...	
Message	Origami	What are you doing?	
Message	Shido	Um! This is, well―!	
Message	Rinne	Shido wasn't looking too well, so I was checking for a fever.	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Rinne	"But thank goodness. It looks like you don't have one.
You've only just got better, so don't push yourself,
all right?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Origami	......	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry Shido, I just remembered something I have to do.
I'm sorry, but would it be okay for me to go home first?"	
Message	Shido	Huh...? I-I see... Well, if you have something to do, it can't be helped.	
Message	Rinne	I'm sorry, Tobiichi-san, even though we were just about to start.	
Message	Origami	There's no problem. I should apologize for not hosting you properly.	
Message	Rinne	"No, you were perfectly fine.
Thank you for the tea. Okay then, I'll be going now.
I'll see you at school tomorrow, Tobiichi-san. See you later, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	Whew... Okay then, let's study...	
Message	Origami	Study what?	
Message	Shido	Er... What?	
Message	Origami	As in study for a test? Or an alternative form of studying?	
Message	Shido	Alternative, meaning?	
Message	Origami	Lo―	
Message	Shido	Y-You don't have to say it! We're doing normal studying!	
Message	Origami	I see. Shame...	
Message	None	"(A-As I thought, I sense danger to myself when alone with
Origami...)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if something happened with Rinne.
I feel like she was acting different than usual...)"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, I have memories of studying here in the same way
before."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	"This problem, your answer. I'm pretty sure it's exactly the same.
When I studied here with you..."	
Message	Shido	"Huh?! Now that you mention it, you're right.
We've studied together before, haven't we?"	
Message	Origami	Definitely.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I figured... But, I can't put my finger on it...
When did I come to your house? When did we study?
I was asleep in bed, so that should be impossible..."	
Message	Origami	That I also don't know.	
Message	Shido	That's kinda scary...	
Message	Origami	Something may be happening.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you might be right.
For now, I'll be leaving for today.
There's something I need to think about too."	
Message	Origami	I see...	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, even though I was the one who invited you...	
Message	Origami	It's no problem. There's something that's bothering me slightly too.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Then, see you later!	
Message	Origami	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Origami	I'd be happy if you invited me again.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. Leave it to me.	
Message	None	(*sigh*... Really, what's going on...?)	
Message	None	"(If it were just me, I could assume it had something to
do with my head after recovering, but if Origami has the
same memory, then it might've happened...)"	
Message	None	"(No. Maybe there's a chance that two people can experience
the same déjà vu.)"	
Message	None	(Man, I have no idea...)	
Message	None	"(And I'm worried about Rinne...
She seemed kinda strange...)"	
Message	None	"(If something's troubling her, she could just tell me.
We are childhood friends after all...)"	
Message	None	"(She said something came up all of a sudden, but
I wonder what it is...)"
