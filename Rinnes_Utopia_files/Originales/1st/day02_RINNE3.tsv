Message	None	(Dinner should be just about ready, right?)	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	None	"(Rinne...? Why is she sighing? Is something wrong?
It's kinda hard to call out to her...)"	
Message	Rinne	Why...? Why won't it work...?	
Message	Rinne	If this continues, it'll all be for nothing...	
Message	Rinne	...I can't give up. No, I can't.	
Message	Shido	Rinne...?	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? S-Shido?!
D-Did you possibly, hear that? Just now..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry... I didn't mean to stand and listen―	
Message	Rinne	Um. Well, you see...	
Message	Shido	No, you don't have to be so shocked!	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"I'm not sure what you messed up with, but everyone makes
mistakes! I'm always making mistakes, aren't I?"	
Message	Rinne	Wh-What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... It seemed like... you had messed up with
something?"	
Message	Rinne	Oh... Yeah, I guess so. That's right. Yeah.	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	"M-More importantly, dinner is ready.
Please call everyone, and we can all eat together, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Err, ah, right...	
Message	None	"(Whew... Rinne's meals are always delicious, no matter how
many times I eat them. Though I tend to eat too much.)"	
Message	Kotori	I'm coming in.	
Message	Shido	Hmm? What's wrong Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"The spiritual wave detected in Tengu City...
I told you how it most likely holds an enormous power, right?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... Something about a far-reaching barrier that some
Spirit used. What about it?"	
Message	Kotori	"Right. It seems that someone"" who's responsible for it
can't completely control that enormous power."""	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"I've been having Reine analyze the spiritual waves every day...
But the range of spiritual energy is too wide, and pretty unstable.
Not only that, but the fluctuations are getting bigger every day..."	
Message	Shido	"Could it be that we actually have some opening we
can take advantage of? Then that's a bit reassuring..."	
Message	Kotori	You idiot, it's the opposite.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	"If we assume the culprit is a Spirit, then this instability
is seriously dangerous."	
Message	Kotori	With this large of a power, if they were to go berserk―	
Message	Shido	W-What would happen, then?	
Message	Kotori	...The city, no, the entire nation, would easily be blown away.	
Message	Shido	N-No way...!	
Message	Kotori	"Even if the scale wouldn't be the same as the Eurasia disaster
30 years ago, it would easily be enough to blow away Japan.
...Before that happens, we need to find some sort of solution."	
Message	Kotori	"Moreover... The fact that we Spirits haven't felt any effects from
being in such a strong and unstable spirit barrier is a really
strange situation in the first place..."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kotori	"A highly dense mass of spiritual energy is surrounding Tengu City.
To put it another way, it's as if Tengu City's become a black hole."	
Message	Shido	B-Black hole?	
Message	Kotori	"You don't get it? With black holes, an object that's too weak to support
its own gravity, shrinks further and further inside from it,
and eventually completely collapses."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Kotori	"It's the same idea. If a Spirit with powerful spiritual energy
were unable to support it... Some sort of distortion will be created."	
Message	Shido	"Um, I don't really get such difficult stuff, but...
Basically, Tohka and the others would be pulled by that
distortion, and it'll be easier for them to lose control?"	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. But this is only a conjecture.
It's possible there's some other reason that's creating an
unstable barrier, so in the end, we can't come to a conclusion..."	
Message	Shido	So it means... it's a pretty difficult problem.	
Message	Kotori	"That's right. But I've already told you that this isn't what you
need to be concerned about, haven't I? The Ratatoskr will continue
investigating, so prioritize dating the Spirits and stabilizing them."	
Message	Shido	Oogh... You're right, that's more important, isn't it?	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine if you understand. Even if we figure out the mystery and
find a solution, if Tohka and the others lose control, then it's
putting the cart before the horse, right?"	
Message	Shido	R-Right... I understand.	
Message	Kotori	Well then, sleep well.	
Message	Shido	A-Alright...	
Message	None	(*Sigh*...Things seem to be getting serious...)	
Message	None	"(But there's no point in me thinking so hard about it.
 Tomorrow's an early start, so I should sleep!)"	
Message	None	(Whew. Good night...)	
Message	None	(...Hmmm?)	
Message	None	"(What is it? Even though it's the middle of the night...
Someone's drinking water...?)"	
Message	None	"(*Yaaaawn*... Well, whatever.
I gotta sleep...)"	
Message	None	(...Zzzzz...)
