Message	Shido	Heeeeey, Tonomachiiiiii!	
Message	Shido	Where are you, Tonomachiiii!	
Message	Shido	Are you okay?!	
Message	Shido	"Jeez, I can't find him. Where'd that bastard
go?"	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Don't tell me he was actually...
Nah. Tonomachi made up the whole
"Tengu Cow" story himself."	
Message	Shido	"B-Besides, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Even if there was, I'm not scared of—"	
Message	???	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Aaaaaaah!	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?!	
Message	Origami	...Did I scare you?	
Message	Shido	N-No... Not at all! Totally fine!	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	"What's the matter, then? Did you find
something over there?"	
Message	Origami	Nothing.	
Message	Shido	"I-I see. Well... I can find him on my own,
so why don't you rejoin the others?"	
Message	Origami	I can't.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	I can't go back on my own.	
Message	Shido	"Well, but you're here all by yourself,
Origami—"	
Message	Origami	I'm scared.	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Origami	I'm scared.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, then let's head back together.	
Message	None	"(There's a chance I could've missed Tonomachi
hiding around, so I guess I can look for him
while we walk back.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, on our way back, we can head that
way..."	
Message	Origami	I can't move.	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What's wrong?	
Message	Origami	I'm too scared to move.	
Message	Shido	You don't look that scared though—	
Message	Origami	I'm scared.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, then what would you like me to do?	
Message	Origami	Piggy-back ride.	
Message	Shido	Wha?	
Message	Origami	Piggy-back ride.	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	Origami	Piggy-back ride.	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Shido	"Here. If you can't move, then hop on my
back slowly—"	
Message	None	(?!)	
Message	None	"(I was about to look over my shoulder at
Origami when, all of a sudden, she leapt
onto my back like a professional gymnast.)"	
Message	Shido	"Ha... Hahaha. Y-You must've been real
scared, Origami."	
Message	Origami	...I'm scared.	
Message	None	"(Aah! Because of how tightly Origami's
clinging to me, I can feel her press against
my back!)"	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, Origami? I feel like we've talked
about this before, but... do you feel like
you're holding on a bit too tight?"	
Message	Origami	Because... I'm scared.	
Message	Shido	Urgh!	
Message	None	"(Origami's pressing her chest against me.
They might not be, um, big, but I sure know
they're there!)"	
Message	Shido	"U-Um, Origami-san...? I-I know you're terrified,
but would you mind loosening up a bit?"	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Um. It's hard to walk...	
Message	Origami	Oh.	
Message	None	(Phew...)	
Message	Shido	Th-Thank you. Now, I can wal—	
Message	Origami	*inhale, exhale*... *inhale, exhale*...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, what are you doing...?	
Message	Origami	*sniff, sniff* I...	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, that tickles. St—	
Message	Shido	WKYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	None	(Aah! Something's tickling my neck!)	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, are you licking my ne—	
Message	None	(—?! I-Is someone coming?!)	
Message	Shido	Someone's coming! Origamiiii! Get off of me!	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant*... *pant, pant*...	
Message	None	"(I pushed Origami off and she dove into the
tall grass before making a graceful landing.)"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...?! Wh-What... did you just do...?	
Message	Origami	I don't remember. I was so scared.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, I see...	
Message	Kotori	Hey! Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	Whoa! O-Oh, it's you, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	"*whimper* That's all you've got to say!
I finally found you."	
Message	Origami	Tch.	
Message	None	"(Huh...? I don't know if I've ever seen that
expression on Origami's face...)"	
Message	Kotori	You took too long, so we came looking for you!	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, sorry. Kinda got lost...	
Message	Kotori	What's the point if YOU'RE getting lost?!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	Well, at least we found you safe and sound.	
Message	None	"(Oh, yeah... I can't say that I had stopped
wondering where Tonomachi is.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Mm... Anyway, what were the two of you up
to just now?"	
Message	Shido	"H-Huh?! N-Nothing! We were doing absolutely
nothing, right Origami?!"	
Message	Origami	I can't say. That it unfolded as described.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Kotori	"GRRRR! You're horrible, Onii-chan! You were
doing something suspicious, weren't you?!"	
Message	Shido	"No! Nononono! I didn't do anything! Hey
Origami! Could you stop spreading rumors?!"	
Message	Origami	...I'm going back.	
Message	Shido	"Hey! Wait Origami! I thought you were so
scared you couldn't move—"	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan! Wait for me!	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, come on! Let's drop off our offerings
and head home!"	
Message	Kotori	O-Okay!	
Message	None	"(*sigh*... Damn it, Origami. I've still got
no clue what's running through her mind.)"	
Message	Shido	I wonder what happened to Tonomachi. Boy...
