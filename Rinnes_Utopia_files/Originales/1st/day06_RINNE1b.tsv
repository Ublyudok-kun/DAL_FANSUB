Message	Kurumi	"My, my. Someone has a lot of friends...
This isn't going to end, is it?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe, hehehe... Aah... So scary. So spooky.
I'm a princess who needs someone to save
me from all these baddies..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hee hee... Hihihihi... I've had my fun.
Time to get serious. I don't want to keep
Shido-san waiting much longer."	
Message	Kurumi	Right? We—	
Message	Kurumi	"Now, now. I'll show you just who's at a
disadvantage here!"	
Message	Kurumi	Hee hee...	
Message	Kurumi	My, my.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe...	
Message	Kurumi	Kihihihi!	
Message	Kurumi	AHAHAHA!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, please hang on a bit longer...	
Message	Kurumi	Now, now.	
Message	Kurumi	Hihihihi!	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe...	
Message	Kurumi	Say something? How's this!	
Message	Kurumi	My, thinking of giving up?	
Message	Kurumi	"You don't look too tasty, but now's not
the time to be picky!"	
Message	Kurumi	Hee hee... Hihi! Kihihihihi!	
Message	Kurumi	Kihi! Kihihi kihihihi! We are good! GOOD!	
Message	Kurumi	Now, the closing number. I'll drink it all.	
Message	Kurumi	I certainly made a meal of things.	
Message	Kurumi	I hope Shido-san is still safe...	
Message	Shido	"Hm?! K-Kotori! I think the barriers are
gone!"	
Message	Kotori	Great news. Everyone did their jobs.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, go on ahead!	
Message	Shido	Huh? But—!	
Message	Kotori	"Tohka's right. They keep coming back.
We'll hold them, so get in there!"	
Message	Tohka	Go! Shido! You'll stop Ruler, won't you?!	
Message	Shido	"Rgh... Got it! Don't push yourselves too hard,
okay?!"	
Message	Kotori	"Hmph. You're one to talk, Shido! If you die,
I'll never let you rest in peace!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay! I promise I'll come back alive!	
Message	None	"(I have to learn... what Ruler really wants.
Why did she create this barrier, and why is
she after me? There's so much... I don't know!)"	
Message	None	"(One more thing, there's one more thing
I need to know... Ruler's true identity!)"	
Message	None	"(If... If what I think is true, then...
Why... Why did she—?)"	
Message	Tohka	Urgh! There are more!	
Message	Kotori	"Sorry for dragging you down in the
trenches with me, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	"Don't worry. In order to give Shido a chance,
we had to restrain the enemy attack."	
Message	Tohka	Kotori! We mustn't hold back!	
Message	Kotori	"Yes, let's get this over with and meet up
with Shido!"	
Message	Tohka	"Got it! No doubt Shido will need our help
soon!"	
Message	Kotori	All right, come at me!	
Message	Tohka	I won't let a single soul pass through me.	
Message	Shido	WHAT?! What is this place?!	
Message	None	"(The inside of Neo Tengu Tower was unlike
anything I'd ever seen.)"	
Message	None	"(Branches stretched over the walls and ground,
reinforced by metallic roots. At the center,
I saw something floating in mid-air.)"	
Message	Shido	What the hell is going on here?!	
Message	None	"(No, I can't stop now. Ruler's gotta be
here somewhere!)"	
Message	None	"(Um, elevator? Of course not, what am I
thinking?)"	
Message	None	(Hm. That's... a spiral staircase, right?)	
Message	Shido	I can climb that... Perfect!	
Message	None	"(My trip up the staircase took far longer than
I would've liked to admit.)"	
Message	None	"(I feel my mouth drying up. My tongue's stuck
to the roof of my mouth.)"	
Message	None	Are you giving up the happiness you asked for?	
Message	Shido	RULER?!	
Message	None	"Everything went to plan, you should be happy.
Why? You had it all... Wasn't it enough?"	
Message	Shido	What is this?!	
Message	Shido	*grunt*...!	
Message	None	"(In this world, your wildest dreams can come
true. But it's just an illusion.
It can't be real. That's why I'm going...)"	
Message	None	(To see her! Ruler!)	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant*... Am I here?	
Message	Shido	Is this it? The highest floor?	
Message	???	I knew it.	
Message	Shido	That voice. Rinne, is that you?	
Message	Rinne	Haha. You've finally come, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Rinne?! Does that mean I was right?	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. Figured it out? Everything is as you
thought, Shido. I am... Ruler."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Shido	Aah! AAAAH!	
Message	Shido	Why?! Why...?!	
Message	Ruler	"There is no reason. My purpose was determined
for me at birth."	
Message	Ruler	"I am the ruler of Eden, and Shido Itsuka...
I am the one who trapped you inside this world."	
Message	Shido	Why? WHY?! Why would you do that, Rinne?!	
Message	Ruler	"From the beginning, I was never your childhood
friend. It was all fake. I implanted my existence
into your and everyone else's minds."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(It started as a hunch. Things that didn't quite
make sense began piling up.)"	
Message	None	"("There's no way Rinne's a Spirit," I told
myself.)"	
Message	Ruler	"How did you realize it, though? I wish you never
had. That way, we could live in Eden forever..."	
Message	Ruler	"A happy and just world, right Shido? Isn't
that what you wanted too?"	
Message	Shido	"So, that's why you trapped us... Why me?
Why?"	
Message	Ruler	You don't need to know the answer.	
Message	Shido	W-Wait, Rinne! Listen to me!	
Message	Ruler	You won't understan—	
Message	Shido	I want to go home with you!	
Message	Ruler	...?!	
Message	Shido	"You may not be my childhood friend!
You may be the one who trapped us
here in the first place!"	
Message	Shido	"But even so! It doesn't change the memories
of when we were together, sharing laughs,
crying together. The time we spent isn't a lie!"	
Message	Shido	"You're a part of my life! I want to go back to
the way things were, together!"	
Message	Ruler	Shi...do?	
Message	Shido	"Please! We're in this together! We'll find a way
to be together even after we leave this world!
A future for you, me, and everyone... Together!"	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, you're always so honest... Listening
to you makes me believe that it's possible."	
Message	Shido	Can't you see now, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	Well... Sorry, Shido. That future is impossible.	
Message	Shido	Wh...Why?!	
Message	Rinne	"I'm grateful to have made an impact on your
life. Our friendship meant everything to me."	
Message	Shido	THEN—!	
Message	Rinne	"However... I cannot let Eden fall! Not now,
not ever!"	
Message	Shido	Rinne? Wait!	
Message	Rinne	"I knew this was the only outcome. Long had
I expected things to end this way, so I've
accepted my fate... Good-bye, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Rinne!!	
Message	Rinne	Eden, Paradise Lost!	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Shido	What's... going on? R-Rinne?! HEY!!!	
Message	Shido	Ugh... Hey, Rinne! What's happening?!	
Message	Shido	WHOAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	Shido	Aah! Rgh... I can't get close to her!	
Message	Shido	It's coming again!	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Tohka	Shido, are you safe?!	
Message	Kotori	"Seriously, you never learn. How many times do
I need to tell you not to overdo it?!"	
Message	Origami	Shido, I was late. Apologies.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?!	
Message	Yoshino	Are you... okay?! Shido...san!	
Message	Yoshinon	"And her trusty sidekick!"	
Message	Shido	Aaaah! Everyone... Thank you!	
Message	Origami	...?! Shido, behind you!	
Message	Shido	Huh?!	
Message	Kurumi	"No no no. You were so focused on socializing
that your concentration slipped."	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi?! Sorry, thanks for rescuing me!	
Message	Kurumi	"No problem at all. It comes naturally to me.
Besides, we all knew this would happen."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but still. Thanks.	
Message	Kurumi	Hee hee. Goodness, Shido. So polite.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Kotori	"Kurumi, another wave. Don't let your guard
down!"	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. How dare you interrupt my conversation
with Shido-san. Rude as ever."	
Message	Kotori	"Shut up. Just do your job. Wasn't that our
agreement?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hihi... Hihi... Kihihihi! Remind me, never
fraternize with a know-it-all."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido! Why are you just standing there?!
Look alive. We can't back you up forever!"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you're the only one! The only one
that can fix this!"	
Message	Shido	What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	Aaah... Shi...do...	
Message	Shido	Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	"(Kotori's eyes went blank, and her movement
was halted. Like she was sleepwalking.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"The branches... They're sapping our energy.
Shido-san, this isn't good. Don't stray from us!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Thanks!	
Message	Yoshino	*pant*... *pant*...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino, are you okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes! I can... still...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, fall back! Oh no!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...san...	
Message	Shido	YOSHINOOOOOOOOO! DAMN IT!	
Message	Tohka	I understand, but don't stop, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, you need to speak with Ruler, right?
Yoshino and Kotori will be fine! Trust us.
Keep going!"	
Message	Origami	Shido, I'll back her up. Don't worry.	
Message	Kurumi	Goodness. Not this troublemaker.	
Message	Shido	Tohka... Everyone... Got it!	
Message	None	"(Everyone's fighting for me. I need to
hold up my end of the bargain!)"	
Message	Shido	What the... What is this?	
Message	Kurumi	Sorry, I failed you...	
Message	Origami	Shido, forgive... me...	
Message	Shido	Everyone, it's okay. I'll do my part.	
Message	Tohka	Yours until the bitter end!	
Message	Shido	Got it! Thanks!	
Message	Tohka	Don't mention it!	
Message	Shido	Just a bit further. Almost there.	
Message	Tohka	Watch out, Shido! Urgh!	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Tohka	I'm fine, Shido. Go to Ru—	
Message	Shido	Tohka!! Sorry!	
Message	Shido	"I need to go. I need to stop Ruler—Rinne.
Everyone's counting on me."	
Message	None	(Rinne! Did I make it...?)	
Message	Shido	Aah... *grunt*... Rinne...	
Message	None	(Just one more step, then I'll be with Ri—)	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Hm... Is it morning?	
Message	Rinne	Oh. You're finally awake.	
Message	Shido	Ah. Morning, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"Good morning. Are you okay, Shido?
You look horrible."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Really? I think I just had a bad dream.	
Message	Rinne	"Ah, I'm glad. It's your day off, so it'd be a
waste if you were sick."	
Message	Shido	Oh yeah, huh. Was today my day off?	
Message	Rinne	"What are you talking about? You didn't
forget your plans with me, did you?"	
Message	Shido	Plans?	
Message	Rinne	Yes. A very important plan.	
Message	Shido	"Seriously?! Sorry. I don't know. What kind of
plans did we make again?"	
Message	Rinne	Isn't it obvious?	
Message	None	"(Hm. I should know this. She says it's obvious,
but I haven't got a clue.)"	
Message	Rinne	A date.	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido. How about a bite?	
Message	Shido	Ah, sounds good. Let's go.	
Message	None	"(Guess I scheduled to hang out with Rinne
today. We decided to go shopping all morning.)"	
Message	None	"(Either way, it's a date. Since she's my
childhood friend, we hang out all the time, but
this is the first time... she called it a date.)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, where to next?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Didn't we just go shopping?	
Message	Rinne	"Didn't we say it's a date? We're just getting
started."	
Message	Shido	Whoa! Hey... Wait, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	It's fiiiiine!	
Message	None	"(Rinne's being forward today. I've seen many
sides of her, but this is something else.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Is this the first time we've eaten together,
just us two?"	
Message	Rinne	Aw, man...	
Message	None	"(We always spent time together, but there
was something special about Rinne being as
happy as she is now.)"	
Message	None	"(I can tell Rinne wasn't forcing her joy,
which made it impossible not to smile.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Hm? What's the matter, Shido? Did you hear
some good news?"	
Message	Shido	No, it's not that. I'm just having a blast.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Got it. I'm having a lot of fun too.	
Message	Shido	Cool. What's next on our agenda?	
Message	Rinne	"Well, it's almost dark, but there's one more
place I had in mind? Can we?"	
Message	Shido	"Lead the way. As long as we're back home
before dinner."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, totally. We'll have plenty of time.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Such a lovely breeze.	
Message	Shido	It is.	
Message	None	"(As the sun set, Rinne and I sat atop the cliff
at Takadai Park, staring down at the city.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Today's date was just perfect. What'd you
think, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"I already told you, didn't I? I had a lot of
fun. It's like... I'm seeing a new side of you,
Rinne."	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha... Was I too giddy?	
Message	Shido	"Not at all. You work so hard. I think it's a
good thing to let loose once in a while."	
Message	Rinne	"Thanks, Shido. It gets me thinking. If only
we could do this... Tomorrow, the day after,
the next week, next month... Forever."	
Message	None	(Like this forever? Yeah, I...)	
Choice		Want this to last forever.	
Choice		Can't live like this.	
Message	Shido	I want things to last forever, too.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. Pinky promise?	
Message	Shido	Sure thing.	
Message	Rinne	"Pinky promise. Cross my heart, hope
to die. Pinky promise!"	
Message	Shido	This reminds me of when we were kids.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, but Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Rinne	You'd better not... break your promise, okay?	
Message	Shido	I know. Friends forever, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Yes. Friends forever, okay?	
Message	Shido	No, Rinne. We can't.	
Message	Rinne	Huh...? Why...?	
Message	Shido	Because...	
Message	None	"(I wonder why... I said that to Rinne.
It's like my mouth moved on its own.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, there's no need for me to act that
way to her. She's my childhood friend, so
of course we're always going to be together.)"	
Message	None	"(That's right. It's not too late. I'll apologize
to Rinne and ask for forgiveness. I'll say it was
a joke, because I always want to be with her.)"	
Message	None	"(Today was so fun. If only I can be with
Rinne forever. What a wonderful thought.)"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(All of my memories returned, the haze
clearing in a rush.)"	
Message	None	"(The information overwhelmed me, like
the world was ready to tear into halves.)"	
Message	Rinne	Then, we can't really be family, can we?	
Message	Shido	Rin—	
Message	None	"(Rinne muttered softly, and the world
collapsed before my eyes.)"	
Message	Shido	Where am I...? Did I return?	
Message	None	(I think those branches got to me.)	
Message	Ruler	"Are you telling me... you broke free from
Eden... with the Paradise Lost?"	
Message	Shido	I couldn't tell you, honestly... But I think so.	
Message	Ruler	...	
Message	Ruler	I see. You're okay then, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	Wha? What is this?	
Message	Ruler	You broke Paradise Lost. I have nothing left.	
Message	Shido	Rinne, listen to me.	
Message	Shido	"When we were on our date earlier, it was
the first time I realized how fun dating you
could be. I wish we could be together forever."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, Rinne? I want to be with you. You're
more than family to me. You're the one I
want more than anyone. The one for me!"	
Message	Shido	"Even if we leave this world, even if we say
good-bye, it won't change what you mean to
me!"	
Message	Shido	"Let's go home together, Rinne. We're
going back to our normal lives. Starting
over from scratch. We don't need Eden!"	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry about failure. I'm here.
Everyone's here. You can find happiness
on your own!"	
Message	Rinne	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Rinne, can't you see?	
Message	Rinne	"Eden's power has left me. It's unstable.
There's no telling what could happen
from now."	
Message	Shido	What?! There's nothing you can do?	
Message	Rinne	There is one thing...	
Message	Shido	Oh! Really? What can I—	
Message	Rinne	Seal me.	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Rinne	"That way, the barrier will vanish, and everyone
will return to the normal world. Shido, only
you can do this."	
Message	Shido	"Okay. I need to take the Spirit's power...
But my power only works if the Spirit
opens up to me!"	
Message	Rinne	"Hahaha... So honest, Shido. You're worried
about that right now?"	
Message	Rinne	Don't worry. I hear she likes you...	
Message	Shido	"Okay. Got it! That's how we'll make it home.
You're coming too, right?"	
Message	Rinne	"Yes... I think... that is the only way we can
be together."	
Message	Rinne	Shido, the time to act is now.	
Message	Shido	Got it. Then, let's go. Ready?	
Message	Rinne	Wait. A memory came to me.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	(Why does Rinne look so sad?)	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Shido	"The core's disappearing. Does this mean we
can go back?"	
Message	Rinne	Yes, you may. Eden's role has ended.	
Message	None	"(I looked around, and I saw Tohka and the
others waking. They're fatigued, but not
seriously injured.)"	
Message	Shido	I'm glad to see everyone's safe. Hey, wait!	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha...	
Message	Shido	Rinne, your body. What's going on?	
Message	Rinne	"You see, I...I'm the only one who can't go
back with you."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean? But didn't you say—?	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry... I lied. Yes, I needed to say that, or
I thought you wouldn't kiss me."	
Message	Shido	Well! That may be true, but—!	
Message	Rinne	"See, I know you, Shido. You're my childhood
friend."	
Message	Shido	"That's right. You're my childhood friend!
Don't give up! Stay with me! Like how you
used to, and will forever!"	
Message	Rinne	"That was never true, though. So, from now
on, I won't exist..."	
Message	Shido	You're lying, right...? That can't be true!	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, you taught me so much. That with
pleasure... comes pain. But it can be overcome.
The good memories always outweigh the bad."	
Message	Shido	Wait!	
Message	Rinne	"It's fine. You don't have to say anything.
Haha. Sorry. Hm? How weird. I can't see
your face, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Ha... Hahah... Not with all those tears.	
Message	Rinne	"You too, Shido. You're crying too. Hehe.
But I see now... what it means... to cry.
So this is what it's like."	
Message	Shido	"That's right! Rinne, there's still so much to
see! So, so... Please!"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, listen to me, would you?	
Message	Shido	Sure. Anything. What is it?	
Message	Rinne	"Our time together... The days we spent...
are precious to me."	
Message	Rinne	"It got me thinking. Maybe Eden was a lie,
but the days with you were all true.
True... happiness..."	
Message	Shido	"What are you talking about? We're still
together, aren't we? We promised."	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. It warms my heart... to know how
much you think about me. But you might
make the others jealous."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Good point.	
Message	Rinne	"Then, while it's just you and me...
I'm going to say it."	
Message	Shido	Say what? This is so serious...	
Message	Rinne	You see, this whole time, I...	
Message	Rinne	I loved you, Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Rinne...? Rinne? Rinne...
RIIIIIIINNNNNNNEEEEEEE!"	
Message	None	(In that moment, I felt like I was floating.)
