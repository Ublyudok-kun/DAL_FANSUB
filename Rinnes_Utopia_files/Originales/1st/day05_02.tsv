Message	None	"(I came out here because I needed fresh air,
but taking a walk alone isn't too bad once in
a while. They say it helps with thinking, too.)"	
Message	None	"(Lately, I feel like every day is so hectic.
And a lot of problems feel like they haven't
been solved...)"	
Message	Shido	Now then, where should I walk to?	
Message	None	"(My legs are moving even as I'm saying it.
Well, the park is probably good for a time
like this.)"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. The park at night is pretty relaxing.	
Message	Shido	Now, then... What to do?	
Message	None	"(In the end, I don't know any more about dating
or the barrier. I feel like nothing's changed...
Is it really okay to continue like this?)"	
Message	???	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hm? R-Rinne...?!	
Message	Rinne	Thank goodness. I thought you might be here.	
Message	Shido	Yeah... I thought you went home, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"Ahaha... I saw you walking in front of your house.
I just wondered what was wrong."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well... I thought it might be nice to do some
quiet thinking once in a while."	
Message	Rinne	You haven't decided yet, have you Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Haven't decided, what do you mean?	
Message	Rinne	"If you think you want to protect someone and make
them happy, you have to keep thinking of them as
precious, you know?"	
Message	Shido	"I don't really understand...
What are you talking about?"	
Message	Rinne	"I'm talking about love. What you're worrying
over... Was I wrong?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh?!
Err, ahh... Well, you see...
It's sort of like that, but sort of not..."	
Message	Rinne	"See. If it's about you, even I can understand.
You have to officially choose someone,
or it's not nice to the girls."	
Message	Shido	"Err... Sorry. I feel like this is
kind of different..."	
Message	Rinne	"If you're with someone precious to you, I'm sure
it will become a truly wonderful love."	
Message	Rinne	"So, try your best next time, okay?
All right, then. Good night."	
Message	Shido	Right, thanks. Good night.	
Message	Shido	I couldn't make a decision at all...	
Message	None	"(Or rather, I got distracted by what Rinne said
and forgot what I was thinking about...)"	
Message	Shido	But I wonder why Rinne said something like that...	
Message	Shido	"If you're with someone precious to you, I'm sure\nit will become a truly wonderful love." 	
Message	Shido	"Ah, jeez! I don't really get it! I'm just going
to sleep for tonight!"	
Message	None	"(To be honest, even if I think on this any more,
I won't get any further.)"	
Message	Shido	Good night...	
Message	Shido	―?!	
Message	Shido	......!!!!
