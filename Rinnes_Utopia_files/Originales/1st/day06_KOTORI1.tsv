Message	Shido	Mm... *sigh* Huh, is it morning already?	
Message	Shido	I have today off, so I want to sleep in...	
Message	Kotori	Shido, it's morning. Wake up!	
Message	Shido	Aw... Five more minutes.	
Message	Kotori	Don't give me that crap. Gosh...	
Message	None	"(I don't see where Kotori went...
Oh no, is she going to dropkick me again?!)"	
Message	Shido	H-Here it comes!	
Message	Shido	Huh... Or not?	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Kotori	"If you're not going to get up, then maybe
I can sleep with you."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kotori	Scoot over. I don't have room.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait! Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	What?!	
Message	Shido	I-I'll wake up! I'll get up!	
Message	Kotori	It's fine. You can go back to bed.	
Message	Shido	Nope! I'm completely awake now!	
Message	Kotori	...I see.	
Message	Kotori	Then, hurry and come down.	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Shido	What was that all about?	
Message	Shido	"Man, that was more startling than her
usual dropkicks."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Where are the others?	
Message	Kotori	Beats me. They all left this morning.	
Message	Shido	Gotcha...	
Message	Shido	Well, feeling any better?	
Message	Kotori	Um, only a little bit...	
Message	Shido	What? Really?	
Message	Kotori	Just a bit tired. That's all. I'm fine.	
Message	Kotori	"If you can give me some energy, then I'll
be feeling better in no time."	
Message	Shido	Hahaha. If you say so.	
Message	Kotori	I mean it.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido. I have a favor to ask you.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it...?	
Message	Kotori	"I'll work hard for you, Shido. So... give me
the energy I need to keep going."	
Message	Shido	Energy... How am I supposed to do that?	
Message	Kotori	You can. I mean, you've said as much before.	
Message	Shido	Oh. I did say that, didn't I?	
Message	Kotori	"Yesterday, I felt a little better when you
carried me home, so would you mind doing
me another favor? Please, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Okay. G-Got it. So, you want me to give you
another piggyback ride?"	
Message	Kotori	"That's not what I'm referring to. I want...
to do something else today."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"The closer you are to me, the calmer I
feel. It rejuvenates me."	
Message	Kotori	So, Shido... come closer.	
Message	Shido	W-Well...	
Message	Kotori	What's the matter? Can't you do it?	
Message	Shido	I mean, not exactly...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido? Please, give me a little energy.
Then, I can... I can do better."	
Message	Shido	...! N-No!	
Message	Kotori	Why not...?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean, "Why not?"	
Message	Kotori	You were so nice to me yesterday.	
Message	Shido	"I can give you all the piggy back rides you
want, but today, you're..."	
Message	Shido	Well, um...	
Message	Kotori	You... really don't want to?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	Is it because we're siblings...?	
Message	Shido	Well, you see...	
Message	Kotori	Understood. Loud and clear.	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	What's with the long face?	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	"I was just teasing. Goodness. You took me
so seriously. This is why people with sister
complexes are so weird."	
Message	Shido	What? Y...You were just teasing?	
Message	Kotori	Look how worked up you got. Hehe.	
Message	Kotori	Man, if only you could've seen your face.	
Message	Shido	You know...	
Message	Kotori	Anyways, I'm going to go back to sleep.	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Sleep? Right now?	
Message	Kotori	"I'm exhausted. Just call me when it's time
to eat. Good night."	
Message	Shido	Okay... Good night.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Shido	"What's going on with her? She's been joking
around with me a lot lately."	
Message	Shido	"I wonder if she's okay. She mentioned that
she's tired, so maybe I should cancel our date
and stay home."	
Message	Shido	Okay, dinner's ready.	
Message	Shido	"It's just Kotori and me for dinner tonight.
First time in a while. Supposedly, Tohka and
Yoshino have physicals this weekend."	
Message	None	"(Reine-san's the one who suggested it. Since
the Spirits are unstable, they need to schedule
physicals for Ratatoskr to collect data.)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, Kotori. She should be awake now. Maybe
I can let her know. I'm sure she's hungry."	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori.	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	Shido	Kotori, dinner's ready.	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	Shido	She's not answering.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...? You still asleep? I'm coming in.	
Message	Shido	WHOA!	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Don't open the door. Wait. Are you wearing
your white ribbons?"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. You got a problem with that?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. It's time for dinner. It's just the two
of us, so I made your favorites."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, that's wonderful! Let's head down
there, Onii-chan!"	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Kotori	*nom, nom*... *chomp, chomp*...	
Message	Shido	Hey, make sure to chew, okay?	
Message	Kotori	*nom, nom*... I'm fine! *chomp, chomp*...	
Message	Shido	How is it?	
Message	Kotori	It's so delicious!	
Message	Shido	Awesome. Have as much as you’d like.	
Message	Kotori	I love you, Onii-chan!	
Message	Kotori	Thanks for the meal!	
Message	Shido	You're welcome. Oh, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Shido	About this afternoon...	
Message	Kotori	Huh? This afternoon?	
Message	Shido	Y-You know, today...	
Message	Kotori	Huh? What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wait, don't you remember?	
Message	Kotori	Not as far as I know!	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey, listen. Or do you need the black ribbons
to talk?"	
Message	Kotori	Hm? Black ribbons? 	
Message	Shido	"Hang on. Do you have no idea what I'm talking
about?"	
Message	Kotori	"*yawn* I'm sleepy again. I'm totally stuffed,
so I'm going back to bed!"	
Message	Shido	"You slept practically all afternoon. Wait, that's
not the point. Hey, Kotori?"	
Message	Kotori	Night!	
Message	Shido	What's going on here...?	
Message	Shido	Kotori. Must be some kind of bad joke.	
Message	Shido	"But ever since Kotori stopped wearing her
black ribbons... What's going on in her head?
I don't understand her."	
Message	Shido	"Oh well. I'm sure by tomorrow she'll be back
to her usual self."	
Message	Shido	"She will, won't she? She'll be the usual Kotori,
and she's going to taunt me."	
Message	Shido	"She said she was just teasing today. It was
all a bad dream."	
Message	Shido	It has to be, right?
