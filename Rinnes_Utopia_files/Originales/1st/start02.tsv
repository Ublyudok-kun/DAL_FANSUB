and filled with kindness.)"

Message	Tohka	Shi...do...?	
Message	Shido	Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	Shido! Shido! Shido...!	
Message	Shido	HNRG?!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka! That hurts!	
Message	Tohka	Huh?! S-Sorry, Shido...!	
Message	Shido	Ah! ...*pant*...*pant*...*pant*...*pant*...	
Message	None	(Wh-What... is going on...?)	
Message	None	(I looked around the room...)	
Message	Tohka	"What is the matter, Shido?
Do you... still feel sick?"	
Message	None	"(The girl looking at me with such worry was Tohka
Yatogami. Despite her human appearance, she is
actually a Spirit, a being with great powers.)"	
Message	None	"(Seeing Tohka's bright smile,
my mind was made up.)"	
Message	None	"(Humans and Spirits shouldn't harm one another.
If there was no other way, I would save the
Spirits myself.)"	
Message	None	"(And... I sealed Tohka's powers. Come to think of
it, my days have been filled with dates ever since
I met her...)"	
Message	Shido	"Uh, that's not it. I just don't know
what's going on..."	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	None	"(I tried to ask her what was happening, but before
I knew it, Tohka had stepped away from the bed
with her back toward me.)"	
Message	Tohka	D-During a time like this, I... Hmm, I see...	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...?	
Message	Tohka	A-All right...! Sh-Shido! You stay there!	
Message	Shido	U-Uh...? What do you mean, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"Just don't move! In order to heal you... I-I'm
going to have to sleep next to you, right?"	
Message	Shido	W-Wait a minute!	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"Don't what's the matter me!
What are you doing, Tohka?!"	
Message	Tohka	Hm? You are feeling sick, aren't you?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, I'm aching all over, but—	
Message	Tohka	"Th-Then I have to warm your body! It's important
to warm up! Very important!"	
Message	Shido	Hey!	
Message	Tohka	"If we're going to warm up, I must hug you!
...N-Naked..."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What, Tohka?! Stop, stop! Please, calm down!	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-Why are you refusing me, Shido...? Are you
saying I'm not enough to warm you up...?"	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not the issue—	
Message	Kotori	Shido, are you up...?!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	Jeez... Causing trouble again.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Shido	D-Did I do something wrong?	
Message	Tohka	"It wasn't Shido... It was my fault.
I'm so sorry..."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are you talking about?	
Message	Tohka	What...?! Don't tell me you don't remember, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, I can't remember anything...	
Message	None	"(Kotori looked over at Tohka briefly,
then back at me.)"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Kotori	"Good. Seems like you're your usual self again.
I guess having a bad memory is kind of your thing,
Shido."	
Message	Shido	Hmph... W-Well excuse me!	
Message	Kotori	"Maybe I should schedule an appointment at the
hospital. Although since you were born with it,
it's probably too late."	
Message	Shido	Just forget it!	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I'm glad you look better than I thought
you would. Besides..."	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kotori	"You just got better a second ago. What were you
trying to do with Tohka on the bed?"	
Message	Shido	N-No! Tohka was worried about me, and—	
Message	Kotori	"Agh... You're horrible. Going through puberty and
can't keep those raging hormones in check, but
you can blame someone else, can't you?"	
Message	Shido	Listen to me!	
Message	Kotori	"I'm only kidding... Tohka, this idiot's all right,
so don't worry."	
Message	Tohka	"O-Oh really?! But Kotori, you're the one who said
if I slept next to him, he'd recover faster."	
Message	Kotori	"I did say that... If you still want to do it,
you can."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Kotori—?!	
Message	Tohka	Hm! I-If it helps Shido get better sooner, then I—	
Message	Shido	"N-No, Tohka! I'm totally fine now! It's the
thought that counts! I feel all better now!
Yeah! Thanks!"	
Message	Tohka	Shido... Are you sure?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I promise!	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Tohka	"Nothing. So long as you're fine,
that's all that matters!"	
Message	Shido	So... Maybe you can tell me. What happened to me?	
Message	Kotori	You seriously don't remember anything?	
Message	Shido	Not at all...	
Message	Kotori	...Maybe we should get your head checked.	
Message	Shido	Ngh...	
Message	None	"(This snide one is Kotori Itsuka. Otherwise known
as my little sister.)"	
Message	None	"(Her personality changes depending on the color
of her ribbon.)"	
Message	None	"(When she's wearing white, she's carefree and
adorable, to the point where you actually kind
of want to mess with her, but...)"	
Message	None	"(When her ribbon is black—so her current state—
you'd be an idiot to upset her. She has such a
mouth on her that there's no way to win!)"	
Message	None	"(I call this her "Commander Mode", as Kotori
leads the organization known as Ratatoskr
from aboard the airship called the Fraxinus.)"	
Message	None	"(While Kotori is charged with protecting
the Spirits as the Commander of Ratatoskr,
she herself has Spirit powers as well.)"	
Message	None	"(It was recently discovered that someone gave her
the powers that turned her into a Spirit.)"	
Message	None	"(Despite her age, Kotori bears a lot
of responsibility from that role.)"	
Message	None	"(I know she needs to be tough, but... seeing my
innocent little sister turn out this way was sort
of a shock.)"	
Message	None	"(But... when I was struggling, Kotori stood
by my side as family.)"	
Message	None	"(No matter how much Kotori changed, I would do
anything for her...)"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoo-hoo, Shido-kun! You're looking\ngreat this morning!"	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san...!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Yoshino, you were here too?	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... U-Um... Are you really okay?	
Message	Tohka	Yes, supposedly he's fine! Aside from his head!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Shido	Nothing... Well, whatever.	
Message	Yoshino	I'm... so glad y-you're safe...!	
Message	Shido	The head part didn't concern you, did it...	
Message	None	"(This awkward little girl is Yoshino. She was the
second Spirit I met.)"	
Message	None	(She's very quiet and abnormally shy.)	
Message	None	"(She somehow managed to open up to us enough to
talk, but it took a while to get to this place.)"	
Message	None	(That's about it for introductions.)	
Message	Yoshinon	"Grr..."	
Message	Shido	Oh! Sorry, sorry. You exist too, Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshinon was the one who said 'hi' to you\nfirst, and you've ignored me all this time!\nMaybe that's proof that you're still sick?"	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I was talking to Yoshino, and I forgot.	
Message	None	(That's right, I can't forget Yoshinon.)	
Message	None	"(Yoshinon is a rabbit puppet and Yoshino's friend.
Yoshino's other personality is channeled through
this little one.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshino would never hurt someone. She's kind...
In fact, she's probably too kind.)"	
Message	None	"(But, her extreme shyness makes her panic, and she
risks freezing everything around her. She may be
quiet, but she still has the powers of a Spirit.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshinon loves to talk, and is something of an
outlet to control Yoshino so she won't
accidentally hurt someone.)"	
Message	None	"(I think now I'm done with
all the introductions...)"	
Message	Reine	How do you feel, Shin?	
Message	Shido	R-Reine-san...?! Y-Your face! It's too close!	
Message	Reine	Hm...?	
Message	None	"(The one who just came in but clearly looks more
tired than I do is Reine Murasame-san.)"	
Message	None	"(She's a very talented analyst for Ratatoskr and
Kotori's right-hand. She analyzes and monitors
the Spirits and anything relating to them.)"	
Message	None	"(She should be very intelligent... But she can
never seem to remember my name...)"	
Message	None	"She suddenly transferred to my school, Raizen,
and is my assistant homeroom teacher, so I see
her often."	
Message	None	"(She always has a teddy bear in her chest pocket. I
can't help but stare at it. She's mysterious, but
generally very nice and dependable... I think.)"	
Message	Reine	"Shin... You just recovered, so you shouldn't push
yourself too—"	
Message	Shido	Hey! R-Reine-san?!	
Message	Reine	Oh, sorry... I've been lacking sleep lately.	
Message	Shido	"I know! But shouldn't you be the one resting,
Reine-san?"	
Message	Reine	"Forget that, Shin... Here, drink this. It was
prescribed by the medic on the Fraxinus. It should
help restore some of your diminished health."	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay. Thank you... Oh, yeah! Reine-san!	
Message	Reine	"Hm... What's the matter? Is there a reason for
this outburst?"	
Message	Shido	"Don't "What's the matter" me!
What is going on?! Explain!"	
Message	Shido	"Tohka squeezes me awake, Kotori and Yoshino charge
into my room, and you're giving me medicine to
"recover"?! Did I contract some kind of awful—?!"	
Message	Shido	(Mmrph! Mmmph!)	
Message	Kotori	Have you calmed down?	
Message	Shido	H-Horori! W-Wha...are you...?!	
Message	Shido	Bwah...!	
Message	Reine	You all right, Shin?	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry! I-It's not like that! H-Hey, Kotori!
Don't just push me into Reine-san's chest
like that...!"	
Message	Kotori	"You looked like you were in panic mode, so I used
a special technique. You got a problem with that?"	
Message	Shido	"P-Problem?! Don't use Reine-san's chest like it's
some sort of treatment center!"	
Message	Reine	If it calms you down from hysteria, I don't mind.	
Message	Shido	Wha...?	
Message	Kotori	"Straight from the treatment center herself. Do you
want to get checked in again? You kinda look
like you want to, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Oh no, I'm fine... Th-Thank you!	
Message	Shido	"Forget that! Can you be serious for a second
and tell me what's going on?!"	
Message	Kotori	"What's going on...? Shido, do you
really not remember?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? No, I don't...	
Message	None	"(When she pressed me like that, I started to get
nervous. Clearly something had happened to me.)"	
Message	None	"(But no matter how much I tried, I couldn't
remember anything... Rather, I had no idea how
I ended up like this.)"	
Message	None	"(What I could barely remember... was that I had a
dream...)"	
Message	None	"(But that shouldn't have anything
to do with this.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Well... You've been knocked out for three days,
so I don't blame you."	
Message	Shido	"What?! W-Wait a minute! Three days?! D-Did you
just say three days?!"	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah I did. Reine, could you please explain it to
my idiot brother?"	
Message	Reine	"Shin... You were asleep at the infirmary of the
Fraxinus. For three whole days."	
Message	Kotori	"You seemed to stabilize and got approved for
discharge, so we brought you to your bed this
morning."	
Message	Kotori	"It was really tough... Tohka was bawling, thinking
it was all her fault, Yoshino almost went
berserk... This is all your fault, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"But... I mean, what do you want me to say...?
And why was I out for so long? I don't remember
doing anything leading up to that..."	
Message	Tohka	Shido... You tried to save me... I went berserk...	
Message	Shido	"Tohka... You went berserk?
What do you mean by that?"	
Message	Shido	—?!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	(I remembered.)	
Message	None	(That's right. Back then, I...)	
Message	None	"(It was when I was chatting with
Tohka in the classroom.)"	
Message	None	"(We were talking about how I had been sick lately,
and how there was a new item at the bread shop
I liked... We were just chatting about nothing...)"	
Message	None	"(Just then, Tohka looked like she was in pain
and ran out of the classroom!)"	
Message	None	"(I rushed to follow her and ran up the stairs
to the rooftop... And there I found Tohka...)"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... R-Run...!	
Message	Shido	There's no way I can!	
Message	Tohka	"Y-You can't come... If you're with me,
even you will..."	
Message	Shido	Even if you don't want me—	
Message	Shido	I... I will never let you be alone—	
Message	Tohka	Shido...! I... don't... want to... kill... you!	
Message	Shido	TOHHKAAAAAAAA!	
Message	Tohka	SHIDOOOOOOOO!	
Message	Kotori	...Seems like you remembered.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, you're reckless... Don't you get it?	
Message	Kotori	It's a miracle that you're alive right now!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry...	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	But I couldn't just leave Tohka alone like that.	
Message	Shido	"And besides, my body can take damage...
Well, I guess sometimes it can't—"	
Message	Shido	Urgh?!	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. You keep on justifying it to yourself.	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you doing?! A corkscrew...
in my gut... that's dangerous! *cough* *cough*!"	
Message	Kotori	"You don't even know the limits of your recovery,
yet still have blind confidence in your abilities.
You're so dumb. I'll have to show you by force."	
Message	Shido	Ugh...	
Message	None	"(Kotori was referring to my abnormal ability to
heal from damage whenever I got hurt. Her power
was sealed inside me, which made it possible.)"	
Message	None	"(Until now, I relied on this power almost
carelessly. But I honestly didn't know how much
healing I could actually do.)"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... That was my fault completely.	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I guess you being dumb enough to go
and help her is what makes you Shido."	
Message	Shido	...I have no words.	
Message	Kotori	"Listen to me. You'd better not
be reckless anymore."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kotori	In your current state, you could easily die.	
Message	Shido	Huh? But I thought I had your powers, Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	"I got you with the Fraxinus when you were
unconscious and looked into you."	
Message	Reine	"The results of the analysis showed that
miraculously, there wasn't much damage
from her rampage. But there was another problem."	
Message	Shido	Problem...?	
Message	Reine	"Yeah... Shin, magic is counter-currenting into
your body. All the sealed power up until now."	
Message	Shido	"B-But this isn't the first time
it's happened, is it...?"	
Message	Kotori	"No, this counter-current phenomenon isn't new, and
we knew it to be a temporary thing, right?"	
Message	Kotori	"It was something we anticipated, so that wasn't
a problem, but... this case is different from that
time."	
Message	Kotori	"I'm still investigating, but we're completely at a
loss. We have no idea what's going on."	
Message	Kotori	"Looking at Tohka or Yoshino, it doesn't seem like
it was caused from the Spirits being stressed...
Shido, do you have any idea what it could be?"	
Message	Shido	"No... I have no idea. I just felt the power inside
me leave... That's all."	
Message	Reine	"Hmm... Did you feel any abnormalities
in your body?"	
Message	Shido	Hmmm... I guess I was a little tired that day...	
Message	Kotori	"It doesn't seem like that would affect it...
Nothing showed up when we were examining you
on the Fraxinus."	
Message	Reine	"That's right... I mean, we did some rigorous
testing, so I'm sure the results are accurate."	
Message	Shido	"I'm sorry. I know it's my body and all, but
I can't seem to give any useful feedback..."	
Message	Kotori	"No need to apologize. This was kind of an
accident, after all."	
Message	Reine	"Shin, you can safely say that all Spirits are now
unstable. As long as you're losing your powers,
you no longer have the divine protection of them."	
Message	Shido	So, that means...?	
Message	Kotori	"You're not invincible anymore. If there's anything
that could put your life in danger, it will do so.
And next time around, you'll definitely die."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kotori	You finally get it, don't you?	
Message	Shido	"So you're telling me... one wrong move,
and I could have died?"	
Message	Kotori	"Exactly. Jeez, you're always worrying us,
every single time."	
Message	Tohka	"If you die, Shido... If I can't be with you...
then... that will make me very, very sad...!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... D-Don't worry about it, Tohka! See, look!
I'm completely safe!"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you should worry at least a little.
I'm telling you now, Tohka isn't the only
one who went berserk."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kotori	Yoshino went berserk at the same time Tohka did.	
Message	Shido	What?! Yoshino?!	
Message	Kotori	"Just like with Tohka, we don't know what caused
it. It may be related, but the Spirit mansion
is frozen on every floor, and we can't use it."	
Message	Yoshino	I...I'm... so sorry...!	
Message	Shido	"It's fine, Yoshino. Don't worry about that.
Are you okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...! I... I... am fine.	
Message	Shido	I see. That's good.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah... Even Yoshinon was surprised!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"All of a sudden, there was this huge surge of\npower, and it wouldn't stop!"	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry... This is all my fault.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ahahaha. It's totally fine!\nI mean we're friends, right?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Thanks, Yoshinon.	
Message	Kotori	"They've stabilized plenty, but Tohka and Yoshino
need to undergo a few more tests. After that... I
guess they'll be staying at our house for a while."	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay. Yeah... Wait, what?!	
Message	Kotori	"What's the big deal? Tohka used to live with us
just a little while ago."	
Message	Shido	"Well I know, but... don't you think it's
inappropriate...? In so many ways..."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, you seem to be rattled. Were you perhaps
expecting something in particular?"	
Choice		No, I'm not!	
Choice		Maybe just a little...?	
Message	Shido	"I-I wasn't expecting anything specific! It's just,
you know! It would be an issue for any healthy
male in high school!"	
Message	Shido	Well, um... Maybe just a little... Yeah, right!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	*Groan*! D-Don't look at me like that!	
Message	Shido	"I-I wasn't expecting anything specific! It's just,
you know! It would be an issue for any healthy
male in high school!"	
Message	Kotori	What? You're going to turn them out on the street?	
Message	Shido	"No. I was just wondering if there was any other
way. I didn't mean it like that..."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, I had no idea... I guess you're the type of
guy to abandon someone in distress, just for
your own convenience."	
Message	Shido	What...	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Mm..."	
Message	Shido	Okay, I was wrong.	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, really? I mean, I could get
another place ready..."	
Message	Shido	Whatever! I'll be responsible for them both!	
Message	Tohka	Shido!	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank you...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aren't you a lucky one? You get to live with the\ncute Yoshinon!"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, it's the first time Yoshino's staying over,
but I'm sure it'll be fine. It's safer this way."	
Message	Tohka	I get to be with Shido again...	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... I think that's a good idea!
Yoshino is with us!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... You're right.	
Message	None	(Wh-Why does it feel so awkward...)	
Message	Kotori	"What's with that look on your face? Seems like
something's cooking in that noggin of yours."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Kotori	"Maybe I should call the cops
instead of the hospital."	
Message	Shido	Don't!	
Message	Tohka	Hehe... Shido!	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	It's a pleasure!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you too.	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	Shido	"That's right, do you want to eat anything?
I'll prepare something."	
Message	Tohka	"Really?! Oh, hmm... Oh, I know! How about that
caviar and foie gras thingy? I saw it on TV.
Supposedly it is truly amazing!"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Tohka... Not that.	
Message	Tohka	Oh, really...? Then, I wonder what's good...	
Message	Kotori	"Seems like as long as Tohka is with Shido,
she'll be stable..."	
Message	Reine	"Yeah... I don't think we'll have any issues with
her current state."	
Message	Yoshino	I... I am also... happy that I'm with Shido.	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes! Very!	
Message	Shido	I forgot to ask, but... How about you, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"You seem to be totally fine, but you're a Spirit
too, right? Are you okay?"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh... I-I'm fine. Compared to Tohka and Yoshino,
I'm pretty stable."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, really? I thought it would be good that you're
with us too, but..."	
Message	Kotori	What?! What are you saying?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I just thought you might be even more stable
if I'm nearby, too. I wanted to check with you,
but..."	
Message	Kotori	W-Well... Uh...	
Message	Reine	I'm 100% sure she will be stable.	
Message	Shido	R-Really?	
Message	Shido	Agh!	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you doing, Kotori?! I mean,
who dropkicks a sick person?!"	
Message	Kotori	"I just want to make sure you don't get any funny
ideas! How much of a sister complex do you have?
I feel like I'm in danger..."	
Message	Shido	What?! I-I would never do anything like that!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Kotori?	
Message	None	(Why does she look so sad...?)	
Message	Shido	W-Well... I said it for you...	
Message	Shido	If I can protect you, wouldn't that be better?	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh... Times like these, it surprises me when you
don't say something completely idiotic."	
Message	Shido	That's pretty messed up.	
Message	Reine	"Shin... Don't worry. It seems like your affection
level is off the charts."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Reine... Milk crepes from Salon du Bonheur.
Ten of them..."	
Message	Reine	Well, despite her appearances, Kotori is...	
Message	Kotori	Old enough.	
Message	Reine	Sorry, Shin... This was all a misunderstanding.	
Message	Shido	Oh, come on! Don't be bribed right in front of me.	
Message	Reine	Bribed? What are you talking about?	
Message	Shido	Uh... Nevermind.	
Message	Reine	I see...	
Message	Shido	"But... no matter how stable you are, there's
a chance that you'd go berserk too, right, Kotori?
Then—"	
Message	Kotori	"I-I know that! I'll be fine... If I need you,
I'll rely on you or whatever."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	"But just remember this: Tohka and Yoshino aren't
as good at controlling their emotions as I am.
So you need to prioritize them first. Got it?"	
Message	Shido	G-Got it...	
Message	Reine	"Shin... I think you should rest soon. You just
recovered. You shouldn't overdo it."	
Message	Reine	"Before you return to the Fraxinus, let's get your
temperature. Lie down on the bed."	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay...	
Message	None	"(Reine-san clearly looks more unhealthy than I do,
but she took out a thermometer.)"	
Message	Reine	Oh, we should clean your body...	
Message	Reine	"Kotori, you take Shin's clothes off
and wipe him down."	
Message	Kotori	Wha—?! H-Hey, Reine?!	
Message	Reine	"Hm? What's the matter? You did it everyday on the
Fraxinus, didn't you?"	
Message	Kotori	"Th-That's... I think you're so tired you're
starting to see things!"	
Message	Reine	No, you were taking care of him so much beside—	
Message	Kotori	Ten custard strawberry millefeuilles!	
Message	Reine	"Shin, I believe I was daydreaming. Today we'll
have Tohka or Yoshino bathe you."	
Message	Tohka	Hm?	
Message	Yoshino	...?	
Message	Shido	"R-Reine-san! U-Um, I can wash up and get changed
by myself—!"	
Message	None	"(I sprung up, and saw the room
spinning around me.)"	
Message	Shido	(Ah!)	
Message	Shido	(Mmmph! Mrmmph!)	
Message	Reine	...Shin, you all right?	
Message	Shido	"Bwah! I-I'm not all right! Not only did I almost
lose consciousness, I thought I'd never come back!"	
Message	Reine	I see... Then lie down.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"(I guess we'll forget whose fault this was...
I lost the energy to fight back and just
weakly lay down to rest.)"	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	None	(Kotori was just watching it all unfold.)	
Message	Reine	"So, what do we do? Seems like it would be a bit
hard for Yoshino... Tohka, do you think you can
take care of Shin?"	
Message	Tohka	"Y-Yes! Leave it to me!
So, what am I supposed to do?"	
Message	Reine	"Well, take Shin's clothes off
and wipe down his body."	
Message	Tohka	What...?! I-I must take his clothes off?	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka, it's okay! I'll wash myself—!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido, you just sit there!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...
