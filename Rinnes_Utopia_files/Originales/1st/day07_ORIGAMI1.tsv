Message	None	"(Mm... Morning already? Kind of rare for me
to wake up before Kotori wakes me up.)"	
Message	Origami	No, it's not. Do not put words in my mouth.	
Message	Shido	"So you're telling me you don't feel anything
when you're fighting a Spirit?! When you
hurt them?!"	
Message	Origami	My heart feels nothing.	
Message	Shido	That's a lie!	
Message	Origami	No, it's not!	
Message	Shido	Why are you so stubborn?!	
Message	Origami	What?! Th-That's because you...	
Message	Shido	Don't put this on me!	
Message	Origami	"I... I hate the Spirits! That's why I joined the
AST! To defeat them... To avenge the murder
of my parents!"	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	"This is all... I've lived for! Since that fateful
day, five years ago!"	
Message	Origami	"So, until I've enacted my vengeance, I cannot
laugh. No, I mustn't laugh!"	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	None	(I'll never give up...)	
Message	None	"(That's what I told her, but I don't know where
that path will lead me.)"	
Message	None	"(But it's not a lie. It's how I truly felt. I want
Origami to smile. For us to laugh together.)"	
Message	None	"(It's none of my business, and I'm being
selfish.)"	
Message	None	"(No, it is totally selfish, but my heart tells
me I can't leave her alone in this.)"	
Message	None	"(I mean, she works so hard, but she's not allowed
to smile? That's tragic!)"	
Message	None	"(What's stopping Origami from smiling... is the
Spirits.)"	
Message	None	"(Only by defeating all of the Spirits will
Origami smile again.)"	
Message	None	"(NO! I can't let that happen. For both the
Spirits and Origami.)"	
Message	None	"(If you get your smile back after hurting
someone, or taking a life, that isn't true
happiness. That's not the Origami I know.)"	
Message	None	"(Instead, if Origami were to kill a Spirit, then
her heart would truly die. She would never
smile again.)"	
Message	None	"(I won't let that happen. Neither the Spirits
nor Origami's heart will die!)"	
Message	None	"(What can I do, though? Argh! I don't know!
I'm helpless, but I still...)"	
Message	???	Shido.	
Message	Shido	OH! Origami. Sorry for calling you out.	
Message	Origami	"...I do not mind. What did you wish to speak
about?"	
Message	Shido	Origami, let's go on a date!	
Message	Origami	Why?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What do you mean why?	
Message	Origami	"Shido, no matter how many dates we go on,
I won't smile. I cannot."	
Message	Shido	We won't know until we try.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Let's start, Origami. This is a war between you
and me!"	
Message	Origami	A war...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah! A war called a date! I'll make you fall for
me, and you'll have no choice but to surrender
a smile!"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Origami?	
Message	Origami	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Shido	"We've been wandering all over the shopping
district, but why don't we actually shop?"	
Message	Origami	I do not mind.	
Message	Shido	"I know this isn't the most romantic date, but
I thought maybe we could get groceries for
dinner... HEY!"	
Message	Origami	What is wrong?	
Message	Shido	"We're in luck, Origami! Today's the first Sunday
of the month!"	
Message	Origami	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Don't you know? The "Sample Stamp Rally"
takes place on the first and last Sundays of the
month."	
Message	Origami	Sample Stamp Rally? What is that?	
Message	Shido	"Origami, I thought you knew everything.
Guess not?"	
Message	Origami	"That is an unfair critique. One cannot be aware
of all city events and functions."	
Message	Shido	Gotcha. I was just making an assumption. Sorry.	
Message	Origami	No problem. You can teach me.	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's enjoy the event while it's on.	
Message	Origami	Roger.	
Message	Shido	This way!	
Message	Clerk	Welcome, welcome! The stamp rally is today!	
Message	Clerk	"Visit all food sample stations to collect all of
the stamps. You'll get a raffle ticket for the
chance to win ¥1000 worth of items! Good luck!"	
Message	Shido	Excuse me! Could I please get two stamp cards?	
Message	Clerk	Welcome! Sure, take your time!	
Message	None	"(The card I received had vegetables, meat,
seafood, and side-dish symbols.)"	
Message	Shido	"Here, Origami! This is your card, okay?
We need to start with the veggies, then meat,
fish, and side dishes to collect stamps, okay?"	
Message	Origami	...Roger.	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's hit the vegetable corner.	
Message	Origami	Since when has this been a thing?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, um, it's pretty recent. Since the Tengu
Quintet was made. Customers are starting to
flock there instead of the shopping district."	
Message	Shido	"Soon, they're going to build the Neo Tengu
Tower, which they said will be filled with
shops."	
Message	Shido	"All of the storeowners got together to think of
ways to keep business fresh here. They throw
events all the time now. Guess this is one of 'em."	
Message	Origami	I see. Now, I know.	
Message	Shido	"Okay! Let's go. The veggie sample of the day
is..."	
Message	Origami	There.	
Message	Shido	Oh, good eye!	
Message	Clerk	"They're comparing cucumbers from other regions
and Tengu City. Give it a taste!"	
Message	Shido	Okay!	
Message	Clerk	"Hey, cutie. Please try one. I topped it with miso,
so let me know what you think!"	
Message	Origami	To try? Roger.	
Message	Shido	So this is from another region?	
Message	Origami	And this is from Tengu City.	
Message	Clerk	Whaddya say? Which is better?	
Message	Shido	"Mm! I can tell after trying both! Tengu City's
cucumber is richer in flavor!"	
Message	Origami	Very juicy.	
Message	Clerk	"Right? It pairs with anything! If you want,
I can wrap one up for you."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry. We planned to make curry today,
so we don't need any—"	
Message	Origami	I'll take three.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Origami?	
Message	Clerk	Thank you! It'll be ¥178 for three!	
Message	Origami	"Simply trying all of the samples without
purchasing one is poor etiquette."	
Message	None	(Gah! That's how it is, huh?!)	
Message	Clerk	"Here you go. ¥322 is your change. Don't
forget your stamp. Thanks for coming.～"	
Message	Shido	You wanna head to the next stall?	
Message	Origami	"We're not going to purchase onions, potatoes,
and carrots?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I will! Okay. Once we get the ingredients,
let's head for the meat sample."	
Message	Origami	The meat sample is over there, no?	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Origami	They're comparing pork and beef.	
Message	Shido	Amazing, Origami. You visited it already?	
Message	Origami	I have memorized the store's layout now.	
Message	Shido	"Got it. Well, let's keep making our rounds
to collect stamps."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(We gathered all of our ingredients for
dinner, and completed our stamp cards.)"	
Message	None	"(It's crazy. I never expected Origami to
buy something at every single stall. She's
practically the perfect customer for the event.)"	
Message	None	"(But being able to try the delicious samples
with Origami was an afternoon well spent
in my book.)"	
Message	None	"(If I ever get with Origami, I wonder if this is
how we'd shop together. Sampling things, and
she'd kindly buy ingredients before we argue.)"	
Message	None	(What a lovely thought.)	
Message	None	(In the end, we didn't win anything.)	
Message	None	"(But Origami's expression was stoic until the
end, and she didn't smile once.)"	
Message	None	"(Origami had her guard up earlier today, but
she gradually lowered it throughout the day.
It put my mind at ease.)"	
Message	Shido	Here I go!	
Message	Shido	Man, I might've bought too much.	
Message	Origami	Perhaps.	
Message	Shido	Oh well.	
Message	None	"(Curry can be made and frozen for another
time.)"	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Origami	Sit. I'll bring you some tea.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	(Phew. I ate so many samples I'm still full.)	
Message	Origami	Here you go.	
Message	Shido	Oh, thanks.	
Message	Origami	Is our date over already?	
Message	Shido	"Hm? Pretty much. Shopping was the main
thing."	
Message	Origami	Understood. Forgive me.	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Why are you apologizing? Oh, did you
not have fun? I should be the sorry one."	
Message	Shido	"I don't blame you. Grocery shopping isn't
anyone's ideal date."	
Message	Origami	That's not true.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	I had fun. A lot of it.	
Message	Shido	Then, why were you apologizing?	
Message	Origami	"I had fun today, but I still couldn't bring
myself to smile. I know how hard you worked."	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	"I wanted to smile, but that day—myself from
five years ago—wouldn't let me. So, forgive me."	
Message	Shido	I see, but that's nothing to apologize for.	
Message	Shido	"I think you got me all wrong. You say it like
this is our last date ever."	
Message	Origami	Wait, what do you mean? You said it's over—	
Message	Shido	"I was talking about shopping. We have to start
preparing our homemade curry, don't we?"	
Message	Origami	...We do.	
Message	Shido	"Even if today's date ends, the war between you
and me wages on."	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Shido	I won't quit until I make you giddy!	
Message	Origami	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	"Origami. Five years ago, the Spirits took your
life away. Your parents, and the moments you
could've spent with them. Your smile, your heart."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"I can't imagine how deep the hatred goes, and
I could never grasp it. That, I know."	
Message	Shido	"But... will your war against the Spirits
really end if you kill them all?"	
Message	Shido	"Your heart froze five years ago. Has time
truly stopped for you?"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"Even if that's the case, I will not give up.
I don't want to... I'm going to end your
vendetta. That's my mission!"	
Message	Shido	"Years. Decades. No, I don't care if it kills me.
I'll fill you with so much love, you can't help
yourself from smiling!"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, you're giving me the wrong idea. It
is as if—"	
Message	Shido	"Origami, won't you be with me? Tomorrow,
the day after, and the day after that..."	
Message	Origami	...?!	
Message	Shido	"Today, as we were shopping, all I could think
about was growing old and doing the same thing.
I wondered what it'd be like if we were..."	
Message	Origami	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	"In being with you... I want to know what kind of
place I hold in your heart. I don't know what
the future has in store for us."	
Message	Shido	"But I'll take whatever I can get. Like today's
date. If we can spend time together having
fun, then some day..."	
Message	Shido	"Someday, if I can occupy a bigger place in
your heart than your hatred, would it make
a difference?"	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	"I... I don't want you to seek closure through
violence. Doing that wouldn't restore your
happiness. You'd be gone forever, Origami."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	Won't you give me a chance, Origami?	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	I want to be with you!	
Message	Shido	"Whatever happened five years ago...
Your heart, your smile, I accept you for who
you are, and I want to help you get them back!"	
Message	Origami	Shi...do...	
Message	Shido	"I know it's easier said than done. Anything
could happen beyond this point. We might
still have to fight the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	"But I'll accept whatever fate comes. You,
your enemies, everything!"	
Message	Origami	Well...	
Message	Origami	Oh!	
Message	Shido	Is that enough, Origami?	
Message	Origami	You're unfair, Shido.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Origami	How could I refuse?	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	But I still don't think I can smile.	
Message	Shido	I vow to make you smile.	
Message	Origami	This is not a war you can win, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Keep thinking that, but I will!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Origami	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah?	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	Shido.	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry!	
Message	None	"(Why's Kotori calling? I wonder if she needs
something.)"	
Message	None	"(Something feels strange. Like a haze or unease
in the back of my mind. Is it a premonition?)"	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise me. That you'll\ncherish Tobiichi-chan. That you won't ever\nlet her go. Promise me."	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, what Rinne said came back to
me. Origami and I were here together. I can't
possibly interrupt this moment.)"	
Message	None	"(I could call her back. It might be serious,
but if I answer the phone, I'll miss out on this
precious moment.)"	
Message	None	"(I can't let this moment slip, but what if it's
something urgent? Decisions...)"	
Message	None	(I feel queasy. Why am I so anxious?)	
Message	Origami	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(That's right. I know what to do.
I'm going to...)"
