Message	Shido	"All right... I still have time. Maybe I should
find someone and invite her out on a date."	
Message	Shido	Oh crap! I left my gym clothes in the classroom!	
Message	Shido	"Man, I can't believe I'm wasting precious
time on something so stupid! Why am I so
forgetful?!"	
Message	Shido	"But I guess if I have time to ramble, then
I might as well go and get them, huh? *sigh*..."	
Message	Shido	"*pant, pant* Maybe I haven't gotten much
exercise, but these damn steps are getting
me outta breath. Keep it together, man."	
Message	Shido	"Man, why do I feel so lonely when the
hallways are empty?"	
Message	Shido	"I gotta hurry up and get my stuff so that
I can take one of the girls on a date—"	
Message	None	(Oh...? Is someone still in the classroom...?)	
Message	None	(...?! O-Origami?!)	
Message	None	(What... is she doing here by herself?)	
Message	Origami	*inhale, exhale*...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...? What are you doing here—	
Message	Origami	*inhale, exhale*...	
Message	Shido	Uh, heeeey? Hello? You listening?	
Message	None	"(N-No use... She doesn't notice me at
all! What is she cuddling?)"	
Message	Origami	*sniff, sniff*... *sniff, sniff*...	
Message	Shido	"*sniff, sniff*... Yo, what are you smelling?
...! HEY! That's MINE!"	
Message	None	"(What Origami was sniffing, I discovered,
were my gym clothes I left in the classroom!)"	
Message	Origami	Oh!	
Message	Shido	Don't... "oh" me!	
Message	Origami	Would you like a whiff, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Why would I want to sniff my own clothes?!	
Message	Origami	Suit yourself.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	HEY! U-Um... Origami-san?!	
Message	Origami	My clothes.	
Message	Shido	H-Huh...?	
Message	Origami	Sniff them.	
Message	Shido	Hell no!	
Message	Origami	...Shido, you're so greedy.	
Message	Shido	WHAT?! Hey, wait! STOOOOOP!	
Message	Origami	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Why are you taking off your clothes?!	
Message	Origami	Because you're dissatisfied with my shirt.	
Message	Shido	That's not what I meant!	
Message	Origami	"I see. Perhaps I need to remove another
layer then..."	
Message	Shido	S-STOP! Please, just hear me out!	
Message	Origami	"No problem. There's no scent like the one
of a freshly removed shirt."	
Message	Shido	Like I said, that's not what I mea—	
Message	Origami	Pull it down.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	Your zipper.	
Message	Shido	Aah... AAAAAAAH! I-I'm sorrrryyyyy!	
Message	Origami	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What a relief... She didn't run after me.	
Message	None	"(Phew. Looks like I got away from her, but
now it seems to be too late to ask someone out
on a date. Darn it.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	"So? How's it going? Doesn't look like\nanything's changed on this side."	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, um... I sort of had a situation with
Origami. I think it's too late to go on a date
now, so I was considering going home."	
Message	Kotori	"...I see."	
Message	None	"(Huh...? That's weird. She would've normally
started chewing me out by now.)"	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...? What the—?!	
Message	Kotori	"Very well. Let's add Origami Tobiichi as\na potential date target."	
Message	Shido	E-Excuse me?!	
Message	Kotori	"Origami Tobiichi might not be a Spirit,\nbut there's still risk associated with her."	
Message	Shido	You mean because she's a member of the AST?	
Message	Kotori	"That's the only thing that could exclude her as\na potential date candidate. Unless you want to\ndate her personally, Shido. That's different."	
Message	Shido	Rngh!	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you know what she did before, right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"She attacked me in front of civilians. She did\nit... with the intent to kill. For now, it seems\nlike she's let it go..."	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	"Her punishment has yet to be determined,\nbut if she's going to be dismissed, there's a\nchance she'll become unstable."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Kotori	"She's in a precarious state. The AST enables\nher to enact her revenge. Without them, though,\nwho knows what'll become of her?"	
Message	Shido	?! Th-That'd be horrible!	
Message	None	"(It all makes sense. Origami, is the stress
starting to get to you...?)"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, that's something to consider. If we\nleave her be, she might try to steal weapons\nfrom the AST base and make another attempt."	
Message	None	(She's got a point. That could happen.)	
Message	Kotori	"Her emotions need to be stabilized, or else she\nmay provoke the other Spirits. With everyone's\ninstability, I'd like to avoid that, so—"	
Message	Shido	"You want me to go on a date with her, right?
Whatever the reason, if it involves helping
Origami... I'll do it."	
Message	Kotori	"What? Sounds like you've got serious feelings\nfor her."	
Message	Shido	D-Don't put it like that! This IS serious!	
Message	Kotori	"I know. Shido, I had a feeling you'd say\nthat anyway."	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez... You're barely able to care for the\nSpirits. You're a fool."	
Message	Shido	Hey, don't call me a fool!	
Message	Kotori	"Listen to me, Shido. You tend to drag your\nfeet with stuff like—"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, yeah! Got it! I'm not all that!	
Message	Kotori	"Just shut up and listen."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	"If you get the chance to go on a date with\nOrigami and get some information on the\nAST, then take it."	
Message	Shido	A-Are you asking me to be... a spy?	
Message	Kotori	"Well, if the boot fits."	
Message	Shido	"Wait. Was that why you wanted me to go on
the date in the first place?"	
Message	Kotori	"Don't get me wrong. Our priority is to\nstabilize her emotional state."	
Message	Kotori	"However, no doubt AST realizes what's
going on as well. In order to resolve the
situation, I can't afford to miss any intel.""	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, if Ratatoskr was functioning as normal,\nany bizarre tactics used against us wouldn't\nfaze me, but I guess it isn't the case for now."	
Message	Shido	"But do you really think I could fool her?
Besides, Origami could be terminated from
AST, right? Then—"	
Message	Kotori	"Don't worry. I've got little faith in you."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey!	
Message	Kotori	"Well, worst-case scenario, you don't have to\nproduce results. It'd just be a bonus."	
Message	None	"(Ugh... I don't appreciate her claim of
having little faith in me.)"	
Message	Kotori	"You seem taken aback. Wanna call it quits?"	
Message	Shido	"I... I'll do it. If there's a chance I can
reduce Origami's worries—however small—then
I'll go on a date with her. But no promises."	
Message	Kotori	"Sure, works with me. Just... if she starts\nacting suspicious again, don't try to fix it\nyourself. Give us a heads up."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	"All right. Let's get to it."	
Message	Shido	Phew... This is becoming an ordeal.	
Message	None	"(It's true, though, that Origami is unstable.
Maybe inviting her to dates on occasion could
help.)"	
Message	???	Shido...	
Message	Shido	WHOA!!!! O-Origami?!	
Message	Origami	You've... forgotten your stuff.	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Th-That’s right. Th-Thanks Origami!
I totally forgot to grab them—Hm?"	
Message	None	(My gym bag feels conspicuously light...)	
Message	Origami	I'll wash the clothes.	
Message	Shido	...! P-Please... Give them back!	
Message	Origami	"Do you plan on asking Rinne Sonogami to
wash them?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? No. I planned on washing them myself.
Why would you bring Rinne up?"	
Message	Origami	Because she's your wife.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	Nothing... Never mind.	
Message	Shido	Oh, hey, Origami!	
Message	Shido	...She took my clothes.	
Message	Shido	"Uh... I-I didn't see anything. Yeah, I'll do
that..."	
Message	Shido	"*sigh*... I can only imagine what's going
to happen."
