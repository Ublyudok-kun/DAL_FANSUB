Message	Shido	"Tohka... Her stomach was growling from time to
time during class... I bet she's really hungry,
but..."	
Message	None	"(The bento's beyond saving... Maybe she's in the
lunchroom?)"	
Message	None	(All right! I'll go see!)	
Message	None	(Hm... She doesn't seem to be here...)	
Message	Tonomachi	"Oh my, Itsuka-kun, did you chase after me to get a
glimpse of my sweet "rear" view?"	
Message	Shido	"You idiot. Who would want to see that?
Have you seen Tohka?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Tohka-chan? No, I haven't seen her...
I thought she was with you?"	
Message	Shido	"No, she isn't...
Oh well, thanks, Tonomachi."	
Message	Tonomachi	"Course. We should eat lunch together
once in a while!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah!	
Message	None	(Now then, where's Tohka...?)	
Message	None	"(Seriously, where did Tohka go?
Is she really not going to have lunch?)"	
Message	None	"(Either way, I'll try searching
inside the school...)"	
Message	None	"(*Sigh*... It's no good. She's nowhere to be
found... I guess it's just the rooftop now...)"	
Message	None	(All right, I'll try going to see...)	
Message	None	(......)	
Message	None	"(Sh-She's not here... Lunch is almost going
to end, too...)"	
Message	Tamae	Oh, Itsuka-kun, what's wrong? Why are you rushing?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Tama―I mean, sensei!
Have you seen Tohka?"	
Message	Tamae	"Oh, um... Yatogami-san said she would be going
home early―"	
Message	Shido	Sh-She went home early?!	
Message	Tamae	"Y-Yes... I heard just now from Murasame-sensei
that she wasn't feeling well, so I was worried
about her, too."	
Message	None	(F-From Reine-san?!)	
Message	Shido	Th-Thank you! Tama―I mean, sensei!	
Message	Tamae	"Ah, Itsuka-kun...! Did something happen?!
Wait! It's dangerous to run in the hallway!"	
Message	Shido	R-Reine-san!	
Message	Reine	Hm? Shin, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	"What do you mean, what's the matter! What's going
on? Tohka started feeling sick and went home
early?"	
Message	Shido	"She's been acting strange since this morning!
She didn't eat breakfast or lunch―"	
Message	Shido	Mmrph!	
Message	Shido	Urh...!	
Message	Reine	Have you calmed down, Shin?	
Message	Shido	I-I'm not calm at all! What are you doing?!	
Message	Reine	"Oh, is that so? Kotori told me that this would
work the best for you..."	
Message	Shido	"Uh... P-Please don't be fooled by that kind of
information! More importantly, Reine-san...
What's wrong with Tohka?"	
Message	Reine	Oh, I allowed Tohka to go home early.	
Message	Shido	"What?! Then, she really did go home?
But... Why...?!"	
Message	Reine	"Hmmm. Usually, when Tohka is near your side, she's
stable."	
Message	Shido	U-Usually...? Then what about now?	
Message	Reine	"Now, when she's near you...
her stress levels rise."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Reine	"There are times when you try too hard to get close
to each other, and a misunderstanding is born."	
Message	Reine	"However, in the rare event that it could lead to
her losing control, I believed it would bring
danger to you."	
Message	Reine	"I sent her home early in order to temporarily put
distance between you both. Was that unnecessary?"	
Message	Shido	N-No, I don't think so, but...	
Message	Reine	Shin, have you heard of the porcupine's dilemma?	
Message	Shido	N-No...	
Message	Reine	Then, try imagining a porcupine couple.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Reine	"Because they love each other, they get closer in
order to be together. The needles covering their
bodies for protection end up hurting the other..."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Reine	"Even though they love each other, they find it
onerous to get close. Don't you think this happens
sometimes with humans and Spirits as well?"	
Message	Shido	"They love each other but can't get close...
B-But... then those porcupines can never be
together, no matter how much time passes?"	
Message	Reine	That's actually not the case.	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Reine	"Through trial and error, you find a way to not
hurt the other as well as yourself. A comfortable
distance where you can feel each other's warmth."	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Reine	"Shin, in order to be able to stay with each other
in the long run, it's necessary to hurt each
other."	
Message	Shido	"A-Are you saying... Tohka and I are
at that stage now?"	
Message	Reine	"Who knows. That isn't something I can decide.
That depends on what you do in the future,
doesn't it?"	
Message	Shido	The perfect distance, for both of us...	
Message	Shido	"R-Reine-san! Thank you! To be honest, I can't
say that I understood everything you just said,
but I want to try doing what I can, in my own way!"	
Message	Reine	"Mm. Everything is up to your feelings.
Also, make sure not to rush things."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes! Please excuse me, then!
