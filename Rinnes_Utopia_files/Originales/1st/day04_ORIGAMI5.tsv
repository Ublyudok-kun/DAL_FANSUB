Message	None	"(I know. I'll go with Origami. I think I'd just
worry the others more.)"	
Message	None	(Uh... Origami's number is...)	
Message	Shido	Hello? Origami?	
Message	Origami	"Yes. Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I-I was gonna take a stroll and head
towards Tengu Tower, but—"	
Message	Origami	"Roger."	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Uh... I didn't say everything yet.	
Message	Origami	"A scenic date. To see it one last time."	
Message	Shido	Oh, yeah...	
Message	Origami	"No problem. I'll head over to the location now."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	None	"(Sometimes I can't keep up with Origami's
brain. Yeah, maybe I'm just imagining things.
Haha...)"	
Message	None	"(Because I left right away, maybe I'll get
there first.)"	
Message	None	"(There's still people waiting in line. I hope
we can get in before it closes.)"	
Message	None	"(What should I do? Maybe I should start
lining up. Or should I wait for Origami...?)"	
Message	None	"(No, I should probably take a look around the
monument. I mean, that's the whole reason I
came here.)"	
Message	None	"(Man, seeing it in person... I'm not sure if I
remember seeing any of this, but... that's
weird, right? Why doesn't it look familiar?)"	
Message	None	"(All right! Maybe I'll go nearer to get a closer
look!)"	
Message	None	(Hm... I don't g—)	
Message	Origami	Shido, stand back!	
Message	Shido	Huh?! O-Origami?!	
Message	None	(—Whoa! What's that?!)	
Message	Origami	"*grunt*! Identification! AST Origami Tobiichi!
Basic Realizer, ignite! Wiring suit, open!"	
Message	Origami	Th-That's... Could it be?!	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?! Wh-What's going on?!	
Message	Origami	Shido, it's dangerous here. Step away.	
Message	Shido	B-But—!	
Message	Origami	This place... is the "enemy's" territory.	
Message	Shido	T-Territory?	
Message	None	(Just then, I was wrapped by a strange feeling.)	
Message	None	"(It was as if I were quickly engulfed by liquid,
thickening in the air around me. It was
unbelievably peculiar.)"	
Message	None	"(This sensation... Have I felt it before?!
Oh, that's right! Origami's cast a protective
shield over me!)"	
Message	???	...	
Message	Origami	...! A Spirit?!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is that...?	
Message	Origami	It's coming!	
Message	Origami	?!	
Message	Shido	Whoa?!	
Message	Origami	Shido! Are you safe?!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah! It whizzed past me on the left, but I'm
safe. How about you, Origami?"	
Message	Origami	I'm fine. Shido, fall further back!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	"I-It's attacking out of the blue! What is it?!
Is it running after us?!"	
Message	Origami	Calm down. I promise to protect you.	
Message	Shido	O-Origami...?	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	"I-It's coming! Wh-Why is it after us?! Does it
think we're its enemy or something?! Maybe
we can convince it—"	
Message	Origami	Shido, get down! The second wave is coming!	
Message	Origami	Protection Territory, max output!	
Message	Shido	WHOA!	
Message	None	"(Origami's saving my skin again... Damn it.
I hate being a burden at a time like this!)"	
Message	Origami	...Shido. This is non-negotiable.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	We can't wait until it reaches its limit!	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?	
Message	Origami	Shido. Don't leave this place.	
Message	Origami	Razor Blade! No Pain!	
Message	Origami	HAAAAA!	
Message	Origami	Now is my time.	
Message	Origami	HM!	
Message	Shido	What the—?!	
Message	None	"(Origami used the No Pain stored on her hip.
Then, a wave emitted from her body, cutting
through the "enemy".)"	
Message	Shido	It disappeared...? H-How's Origami?	
Message	Origami	*pant, pant*... *pant, pant*...	
Message	Shido	O-Origami! Are you okay?!	
Message	Origami	I'm fine... No problem.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Origami	I'm glad that you're safe though.	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah, thanks to you. I'm fine.	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. Your life is top priority.	
Message	Shido	"Okay, but what was that...? No one around
us seemed to notice."	
Message	Origami	"I believe we're in the thick of this enemy's
territory. It might have been isolated."	
Message	Shido	Isolated...?	
Message	Origami	"There's a chance that the radius of the barrier
has shifted."	
Message	Shido	"...?! That can happen?! Then, do you think
the barrier has something to do with Tengu
City?"	
Message	Origami	I don't know...	
Message	Origami	Just...	
Message	Shido	Just what?	
Message	Origami	"The enemy's attack earlier... could have been
a warning."	
Message	Shido	W-Warning?	
Message	Origami	"The enemy blocked all of my attacks, but
you'll notice that the trajectory of its own
attacks was far from us."	
Message	Shido	What?!	
Message	Origami	"One can assume it missed intentionally. In short,
it was either a warning or a threat."	
Message	Shido	"So there's some secret they don't want us
to uncover here?"	
Message	Origami	"Based on the timing, I believe it was because
of our proximity to the monument."	
Message	Shido	Th-The monument? So something's there?	
Message	Origami	"It is unclear. Especially whether or not it is
an enemy."	
Message	Shido	Was it a Spirit?	
Message	Origami	"I have received no information on that kind of
Spirit at the AST."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see, but when it disappeared... it looked
close to how the Astral Dress disappears, too."	
Message	Origami	You're right, but we cannot let our guards down.	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	None	"(I need to report this to Kotori and have her
look into it.)"	
Message	Shido	"Origami, sorry. Let's end our date here for now.
I'm sad we couldn't hit the rooftop."	
Message	Origami	"Not a problem. We must first prioritize learning
what this thing's motivations are."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, but I'm really glad you were here with
me. If I were alone, there would've been no way
I could've handled that."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Origami!	
Message	Origami	I do not mind. I will do anything for you.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Shido	...So thanks to Origami, I made it home safe.	
Message	Kotori	...So?	
Message	Shido	Uh. That's it, really.	
Message	Kotori	"So just because you're good, you think
everything's fine?"	
Message	Kotori	What the hell, brother?!	
Message	Shido	Ugh!	
Message	Kotori	"Why are you going around like that without
telling me? What would you do if something
happened to you?!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... I-I didn't mean to worry you.	
Message	Kotori	"Do you have any idea what your body is going
through right now?! I don't even have powers!
How many times have I told you?!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, it's all my fault.	
Message	Kotori	Well, at least you're safe.	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"I'll have people investigate the monument
immediately, but..."	
Message	Kotori	"Because of your reckless actions, there's a
chance the Spirits might go berserk. Next
time, be sure to consult with me."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... I promise.	
Message	Kotori	"As long as you know. The barrier covering Tengu
City seems related to this, but we won't know
until we get some results."	
Message	Shido	Right... 	
Message	Kotori	"Okay. I hope you'll make some progress, then.
Leave the situation to us. Shido, just continue
looking after the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	Right. Got it.
