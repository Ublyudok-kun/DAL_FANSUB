Message	Tohka	So, that's how it is...	
Message	Ai	*Sniffle* I see, I see. What a touching effort...!	
Message	Ai	"All right! Then I'll pitch in for your sake,
Tohka-chan!"	
Message	Mai	Hey Ai, do you mean...?!	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Ai	"That's right, these are VIP tickets to Tengu
Cinema! With these, you can choose to see
any movie at any time, in any seat, with anyone!"	
Message	Mai	Ai! Weren't you planning to use those yourself―	
Message	Ai	"Don't say any more! Or Tohka-chan's gonna end up
refusing...!"	
Message	Mai	"T-Tohka-chan...! Just keep quiet and please accept
them...!"	
Message	Mii	"Please... Let Ai be the generous woman we all know
she is!"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...!	
Message	Ai	Take those, and invite Itsuka-kun to the movies!	
Message	Tohka	I-I'll... invite him...	
Message	Ai	"Tohka-chan, love requires strategy! There are
times when it's bad to be a woman who walks one
step back, or is modest, or always serving a man!"	
Message	Tohka	...?	
Message	Ai	"It's called the ol' ""push and pull""! You have to
push once... and then pull him back in again."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... This is difficult... That wasn't written
in the ""man-gazine""..."	
Message	Mai	"Well, it does make a good reference for many
things..."	
Message	Mii	"As necessary as it is to a woman's arsenal,
it won't solve every problem."	
Message	Mii	"In fact, if you end up thinking that everything
is listed in there, there's a good chance you'll
have the rug pulled out from under you, you know?"	
Message	Tohka	I-Is that so...?	
Message	Ai	"Right. So it's important to put it to practice and
refine your sense of strategy as you go along."	
Message	Ai	"For example, the article that says when you get an
e-mail from your love interest, it's good to wait
and tease them for about a day before replying..."	
Message	Ai	"But people's sense of time differs, so you might
end up missing your chance by making them wait.
Who knows, someone could even steal your man..."	
Message	Tohka	Th-That would be bad!	
Message	Ai	"Right? So you don't have to follow it word-for-word.
There are lots of things not written in it."	
Message	Mai	"So, that's why today she'll try pushing with those
tickets?!"	
Message	Ai	Exactly!	
Message	Mii	Hm... It may be the best time to act...	
Message	Tohka	H-How do I invite him? I-If he refuses―	
Message	Ai	"Ahh, no worries, we have a secret plan ready!
So you see... *whisper, whisper, whisper*..."	
Message	Ai	"Whoops! The Itsuka-kun of your dreams has
just come out! All right then, Tohka-chan!
Just like I said, do your best!"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...!	
Message	Mii	"It's all about that gap! The gap!
Between the ideal ladylike modesty, and the
aggressive advances of a confidant woman!"	
Message	Mii	"Push, then pull! Be forceful when you invite him!
But be graceful and reserved during the movie!
Then you'll win it!"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I'm grateful for your advice! I-I will try!	
Message	Ai	Mai! Mii! We shouldn't get in the way! Let's go!	
Message	None	"(Huh? Wasn't that the Ai Mai Mii Trio that ran
by just now...?)"	
Message	None	(Hmm... Over there, is that...?)	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tohka! So you were here all along?	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido!	
Message	Shido	What were you doing?	
Message	Tohka	Um! N-Nothing!	
Message	Shido	"I-I see...
Well, I was about to invite you on a da―"	
Message	Tohka	W-Wait Shido! I-I must be the one to invite you!	
Message	Shido	Uh... Huh?	
Message	Tohka	"J-Just wait a moment!
Wh-When I invite him, it must be... forcefully..."	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... P-Please... I-I want...	
Message	Shido	Wha―?!	
Message	None	"(As Tohka twisted herself into a strange pose,
she approached while waving around some tickets.
Um, what is this weird movement...?)"	
Message	Tohka	...Y-You to take...	
Message	Shido	Whoa?! Hey! Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	...M-Me to the movies...	
Message	None	"(Wh-What the...! This isn't good! The blood's
rushing to my face!)"	
Message	None	"(I bet the Ai Mai Mii Trio told her something
weird and... this is the result of a huge
misunderstanding...!)"	
Message	None	"(Th-This is bad! I have to hurry and get away!
Whoa, Tohka's holding on with all her strength!)"	
Message	Shido	"Gaaah! I-I'll take you! I'll take you, so please
let go for a sec!"	
Message	Tohka	Ohh! Is it really all right?!	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...!	
Message	None	"(I was already going to invite
her on a date anyway.)"	
Message	Tohka	"All right, it was a success...! After this,
I shall be graceful and reserved at the theater...
Then Shido will be infatuated with me...!"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What are you mumbling about...?	
Message	Tohka	"Ah! I-It's nothing!
More importantly, please hurry
and take me to the movies!"	
Message	None	"(Hm? The thing she was waving around just now
looked like movie tickets.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh! Are these VIP tickets for Tengu City Cinema?
These give you priority access so you can see
whatever you want."	
Message	Tohka	Is that something amazing?	
Message	Shido	"There are times when you end up having to stand in
order to watch popular movies. But with these
tickets, you can sit in reserved seating."	
Message	Tohka	I see, then let's go right away!	
Message	Shido	"With these tickets, there's no need to rush, so
let's go home for now and leave our stuff there."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Let us do that!	
Message	None	"(This time of day, there are quite
a lot of people...)"	
Message	None	"(Now then, I wonder what movies are showing...
It'd be nice if there were movies Tohka would want
to see...)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido?	
Message	Shido	What's is it? Did you find a movie you like?	
Message	Tohka	"No, it's not that. For a while now, there's been
a fragrant smell drifting around, but...?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's probably the smell of popcorn.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Pop...corn? What is that?	
Message	Shido	"Oh right, you've never tried it. It's a snack you
make by heating up corn kernels. There's a salted
flavor and a sweet flavor... Do you want to try?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I would like to eat it!	
Message	Shido	"Then once we've decided on a movie, let's buy
popcorn and some kind of drink, then go inside."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm, go inside? Is there somewhere
else to go from here?"	
Message	None	(S-Somewhere else to go...)	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka? Can I ask one thing?	
Message	Tohka	What?	
Message	Shido	Do you know what a movie is?	
Message	Tohka	"I heard it is like watching a large television.
Am I wrong?"	
Message	Shido	"Er, well that's about right, but...
You invited me without really knowing
what a movie is?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph! Don't misunderstand me! I didn't invite
you because I wanted to see a movie! I invited
you because I wanted to be with you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	I-I see...! E-Err... um...	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what's wrong?!	
Message	Shido	"N-No, it's nothing!
Well, for now, I'll explain what a movie's like,
all right?"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, please do!	
Message	Shido	"―So put simply, like you said before, you watch
a screen like a large TV in a huge room with a
bunch of other people."	
Message	Tohka	Hmmm, I see...	
Message	Shido	"Hm? It's Kotori. I wonder what it is...
Tohka, wait just a sec."	
Message	Tohka	All right.	
Message	Kotori	Shido, you're in the middle of a date with\nTohka, right? It looks like it's going well.	
Message	Shido	You can tell if it's going well or not?	
Message	Kotori	If we monitor Tohka's mental graph, it's obvious.\nBut we are having troubling linking with your\npositional information. Where are you right now?	
Message	Shido	At Tengu Cinema.	
Message	Kotori	Hmmm, a movie date. So... have you decided what\nmovie to watch?	
Message	Shido	No, we're about to choose now.	
Message	Kotori	I see, then we'll support you, dummy. Just so\nthat the date doesn't fail from your movie\nchoice.	
Message	Shido	Sorry for being a dummy!	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, yeah, keep complaining. For now, we'll\nnarrow down the movie genres from here!	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... It looks like there are a lot,
so it'd be helpful."	
Message	Kotori	Usually, I'd tell you the titles, but with the\ncurrent state of the Fraxinus, it's impossible.\nYou'll have to judge for yourself from there.	
Message	Shido	Hmm, got it.	
Message	Kotori	We will reference both data from normal girls as\nwell as Tohka to supply you with possible choices\nto compare with the movies at your location.	
Message	Shido	Even that much is helpful.	
Message	Kotori	All right, there it is... I'll send it now.	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Kotori	Be careful in determining what Tohka would like.\nEven one mistake could lead to a stressful night,\nand possibly have her lose control, you got it?	
Message	Shido	I-I'll be careful...	
Message	Kotori	Well then, I'll pray for the success\nof your date.	
Message	None	"(Hmmm, Sci-fi adventure, romance, and horror
genres, huh... Which would be good for Tohka?)"	
Choice		3-D blockbuster! Sci-fi adventure!	
Choice		Here come the waterworks! A tale of pure romance!	
Choice		It's here! A classic summer horror movie!	
Message	None	"(Yeah, I feel like the super-curious Tohka would
like this. It feels like something anyone can
enjoy without having to think too much...)"	
Message	None	"(The question is, what sci-fi movies are they
showing right now... Hmm... That, huh...?
Looks like it'll do the trick.)"	
Message	Shido	All right, Tohka, let's go see that!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm...while watching a movie...
graceful and reserved..."	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	...H-Hmmm?! Wh-Wh-What's wrong, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"Ah no, I was just saying that this would be a good
movie to see..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm?! I-I see! I am good with anything as long as
I can watch it with you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh...! Er... I-I'm sure you'll enjoy it too,
Tohka."	
Message	Shido	"Um... It's a 3D movie called ""Captain Joker. 
You can see a lot of things pop out at you
from the screen. Doesn't it sound interesting?"""	
Message	Tohka	"Ohh! It sounds like fun!
Let us hurry and go, then!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait just a sec!
We're gonna go buy popcorn and drinks, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Ah! That's right!	
Message	Shido	"We still have time until it starts. All right,
let's go, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	None	"(As predicted, the movie isn't anything too deep.
But since they spent so much on CGI, it's easy
to watch without getting bored.)"	
Message	None	"(Even Tohka, who at first was strangely restless
and stiff, is now glued to the screen.)"	
Message	None	"(In the year 0088 of the New Cosmic Calendar,
humanity sent out an exploration vessel to search
for a new home outside of the solar system...)"	
Message	None	"(A mysterious message from the vessel arrives
—""Argh, the spiders! The spiders!""—
before suddenly cutting out.)"	
Message	None	"(The solar system is ensnared by the giant space
spiders, wrapping stars in webs while traveling,
and transforming it into a great spider's nest.)"	
Message	None	"(Earth is completely enveloped in a cocoon, and
the people can no longer see the blue sky. The
space wanderer, Captain Joker, comes to save them.)"	
Message	None	"(Creeping along the threads connecting the
planets, the spiders devour the people on Mars and
the Moon, then soon make their way toward Earth.)"	
Message	None	"(The sky, wrapped up in a white cocoon, is eaten
apart, and the Batchula descend in droves to wrap
people up in webbing and slowly prey upon them!)"	
Message	Tohka	"A-Aaaaaaahhh! Sh-Shido! It's dangerous!
Th-The spider! The spider web! It's coming
this way!"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa...! T-Tohka...?!
I-It's okay! It's just a movie!
It only looks like it's jumping out!"	
Message	Male Customer A	Hey, be quiet! I can't hear the movie!	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...!	
Message	Tohka	"I-I apologize, Shido... I couldn't
help but get caught up...!"	
Message	Shido	"No... it's fine, but you have to be quiet in
a theater, okay...?"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes... I was trying to, but―	
Message	Tohka	"Hm?! Sh-Shido!
""Captain Joker"" is in danger!"	
Message	Tohka	"C-Curse you giant spiders! How cowardly to attack
in such large numbers!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey...!	
Message	Tohka	"He's outnumbered that way! All right!
I will help him with Sandalphon―"	
Message	Shido	"T-T-T-Tohka?!
Stop! Stop!!"	
Message	Tohka	"―Hm?! Oh?! I've done it again...!
I-I apologize, Shido!"	
Message	Female Customer A	H-Hey! You're scattering popcorn everywhere!	
Message	Male Customer B	"You there! You're being noisy!
If you wanna make a scene, do it outside!"	
Message	Shido	I-I'm so sorry...!	
Message	None	"(Despite piercing stares, we managed to get
through the whole movie, although I had slunk down
in my seat and couldn't concentrate on the story...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... Why do I always end up doing
something like this?"	
Message	Shido	"Don't let it get to you so much. It was your
first movie, and a 3D one at that. It can't
be helped that you'd get really worked up."	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... have you become infatuated with me?	
Message	Shido	Wh-Wh—?	
Message	Tohka	"I-It is nothing! Forget about it!
I apologize, but I'll head home first...!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Tohka...!	
Message	None	"(Hmmm... did I mess up with the movie selection?
It looked like she was enjoying it, but maybe it
was pushing it to ask Tohka to stay quiet...)"	
Message	Kotori	Hey... Tohka's mental state's gotten pretty\nunstable, you know?	
Message	Shido	"Well, it was going fine until a certain point...
She got so into the movie and was so loud that
we got scolded. She seems depressed now..."	
Message	Kotori	I see. Well, I guess it was her first time...\nSo, what did you end up watching?	
Message	Shido	A science fiction flick, Captain Joker.	
Message	Kotori	...While her mental graph gets tense halfway,\nher enjoyment metrics scored really high. It\nlooks like you had the right idea, at least.	
Message	Shido	I-I wonder...	
Message	Kotori	It's just that your guidance and support skills\nwere lacking.	
Message	Shido	―Urgh!	
Message	Kotori	Conversely... You could say we made it through\n with just this outcome because it was you,\nShido.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	"You're really dense... Speaking of which,
what's Tohka doing?""	
Message	Shido	""W-Well, she said she'd go home first,
so she left by herself―"	
Message	Kotori	Why didn't you say so?! Didn't I tell you that we\ncan't monitor your positional info from here?!\nFind her right now and follow up, dumbass!	
Message	Shido	You're right... I have to support Tohka.	
Message	None	"(Even if she's a Spirit, Tohka still seems like
a regular girl. I hope she'll like this kind of
romance movie...)"	
Message	None	"(As for whether or not I'd want to see it...
It's complicated.)"	
Message	None	"(A tear-jerker romance... It'd be nice if there was a
good one― Oh, this looks good!)"	
Message	Shido	All right, Tohka, let's go see that!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm...while watching a movie...
graceful and reserved..."	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	...H-Hmmm?! Wh-Wh-What's wrong, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"Ah, nothing. I was just saying I decided which
movie we should watch."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm?! I-I see! I am good with anything
as long as I can watch it with you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh...! Er... I-I'm sure you'll enjoy
it too, Tohka."	
Message	Shido	"Umm... It's called ""One Last Week,"" which is based
on a best-selling novel..."	
Message	Tohka	"One Last Week?! That seems quite interesting!
Then let us hurry and watch!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait just a sec!
We're gonna go buy popcorn and drinks, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Ah! That's right!	
Message	Shido	"It looks like we still have time until the movie
starts, so let's head to the concession stand."	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	None	"(As I predicted, it was a romance about a
terminally-ill lover... The concept's so overdone,
I really doubt it'll be much of a tear-jerker.)"	
Message	None	"(However, Tohka, who was strangely restless at
first, was now glued to the screen... It's almost
at the climax, too.)"	
Message	None	"(I guess she was the typical girly girl,
after all...)"	
Message	Tohka	Ohh... *sniffle*...!	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Huh...?!	
Message	Tohka	"Waaaahhh...! *sniffle*...*sniff*...! Sh-Shido!
Wh-Why... Why is it so?! Uwaaaaaah...!"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...! A-Are you okay...?	
Message	Female Customer A	"Hey...! Keep it down over there! This is a good
scene, so shut up already!"	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...!	
Message	Tohka	"*Sniffle*...! *Sniffle*...! Shido...
I'm sorry... Th-The bride and... the groom
are... j-just so pitiable and... *sniffle*..."	
Message	Shido	"No... it's fine, but you have to be quiet in
a theater, okay...?"	
Message	Tohka	"*Sniffle*...! I-I am trying, but... I feel so bad
for them... I-I'm sorry... Shido...!"	
Message	Tohka	"B-But still... *sniffle*! Is there... *sniffle*...
nothing that can be done... for the groom...?"	
Message	Shido	W-Well, this is a movie, so...	
Message	Tohka	...*Sniffle*...urgh...*sniffle*...!	
Message	Shido	...T-Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	W-Waaaaaaaahhh...!	
Message	Shido	Hey, hey... T-Tohka! Please calm down!	
Message	Female Customer A	Hey, you two! Cut it out already!	
Message	Shido	I'm sorry... I'm very sorry!	
Message	Female Customer B	"Shhhh...! Be quiet...! You're ruining
the movie...!"	
Message	Shido	I-I'm sorry...	
Message	None	"(We exited to the lobby amidst piercing glares
from our surroundings...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... Why do I always end up doing
something like this?"	
Message	Shido	"Don't let it get to you so much. It was your
first movie. It can't be helped that you'd get
super touched by the story."	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... have you become infatuated with me?	
Message	Shido	Wh-Wh—?	
Message	Tohka	"I-It is nothing! Forget about it!
I apologize, but I'll head home first...!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Tohka...!	
Message	None	"(Hmmm... did I mess up with the movie selection?
It looked like she was enjoying it, but maybe it
was pushing it to ask Tohka to stay quiet...)"	
Message	Kotori	Hey... Tohka's mental state's gotten pretty\nunstable, you know?	
Message	Shido	"Well... She cried a lot towards the end and we got
scolded. She seems depressed because of that..."	
Message	Kotori	Hmmm... So then, it was a real\ntear-jerker, was it?	
Message	Shido	"Right. The one called ""One Week Left""."	
Message	Kotori	...While her mental graph gets tense halfway,\nher enjoyment metrics scored really high. It\nlooks like you had the right idea, at least.	
Message	Shido	I-I wonder...	
Message	Kotori	It's just that your guidance and support skills\nwere lacking.	
Message	Shido	―Urgh!	
Message	Kotori	Conversely... You could say we made it through\n with just this outcome because it was you,\nShido.	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	"You're really dense... Speaking of which,
what's Tohka doing?""	
Message	Shido	""W-Well, she said she'd go home first,
so she left by herself―"	
Message	Kotori	Why didn't you say so?! Didn't I tell you that we\ncan't monitor your positional info from here?!\nFind her right now and follow up, dumbass!	
Message	Shido	You're right... I have to support Tohka.	
Message	None	"(Yeah, since Tohka is fine with... and in fact,
has fun with... tests of courage, she might
like this...)"	
Message	None	"(The problem is what kind of horror movie they're
showing. Hm... That, huh...? It looks like your
average ""B-movie"", but...)"	
Message	Shido	All right, Tohka, let's go see that!	
Message	Tohka	"Hm...while watching a movie...
graceful and reserved..."	
Message	Shido	Heeeey, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	...H-Hmmm?! Wh-Wh-What's wrong, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"Ah, nothing. I was just saying I decided which
movie we should watch."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm?! I-I see! I am good with anything
as long as I can watch it with you, Shido!"	
Message	Shido	"Uh...! Er... I-I'm sure you'll enjoy
it too, Tohka."	
Message	Shido	"Umm, I don't know the details, but it's a horror
film called ""Guilty Land""."	
Message	Shido	"Just a while ago we did something that was sort
of like a test of courage, right? It's sort of
like that, it's kind of a scary movie..."	
Message	Tohka	"It's scary? I'm curious as to what it's like!
Then, let us hurry and go!"	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait just a sec!
We're gonna go buy popcorn and drinks, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Ah! That's right!	
Message	Shido	"It looks like we still have time until the movie
starts, so let's head to the concession stand."	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	None	"(The movie smelled of B-grade stuff right off the
bat, but it's surprisingly enjoyable.)"

building to test their courage. The performance is

miss a second of it.)"

Message	Tohka	N-No... Stop...!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Tohka! A-Are you okay...?!
