Message	None	"(Oogh. I ran up so many steps today, so my thighs and calves
 are super sore, but... I have so many dates to go on.)"	
Message	None	(Alright, I'll have us hang out at home then.)	
Message	Shido	"Hey Tohka? We still have some time until dinner,
so do you want to kill some time by playing games?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Ohhh, that beep boop-ing thing that Kotori often does!
If you wish to play, Shido, then I will as well!"	
Message	Shido	Okay, then do you want to battle?	
Message	Tohka	Yes, bring it on!	
Message	Shido	Then here Tohka, use this controller.	
Message	Tohka	Hm, this one, yes?	
Message	Shido	"Alright, let's start with practice first.
I've done it before so I know, but this is your first time, right Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmph! No, that's not so.
I've played it before with Kotori, when she was on break."	
Message	Shido	Huh!? I-Is that so?	
Message	Tohka	Yes, so any time is fine. Bring it on, Shido!	
Message	Shido	"Alright, then that makes things faster!
It's too early to win against me, you know?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm! I'll take you on!	
Message	Shido	My character is Kazuma, the master of Jyukkokuken!	
Message	Tohka	Oh?	
Message	Shido	Who do you use, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, I can win with this one!	
Message	Shido	――!?	
Message	None	"(The character that Tohka selected is a magician called
"Pandabear," and as the name suggests, it's a straightforward
cross between a bear and a panda.)"	
Message	None	"(The hyper-realistically drawn, malicious-looking panda's face
has red eyes that gleam from underneath its formal robe and hood.)"	
Message	None	"(The hands sticking out of either sleeves are as rough as a bear's,
and covered in bristly brown hair. Lastly, in his hand was a giant
staff inlaid with red jewels.)"	
Message	None	(No matter how anybody looks at him, he's more scary than cute, right...?)	
Message	Shido	H-Hey Tohka. Can I ask you one thing?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what is it?	
Message	Shido	"W-Why did you pick that character out of everything else?
Weren't there cuter, or cooler-looking ones?"	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm! Do you not know his story, Shido?
He's a magician, and when he wins against an opponent,
he changes them into his favorite food and eats them!"	
Message	Shido	...A-Ahh, I see.	
Message	None	"(...I suppose in a way, it's a very Tohka-like choice.
...Nobody uses that character, so I completely forgot.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Now then! Today, I will change you into a hamburg steak
with plenty of demi-glace sauce!
――No, wait...ponzu with radish is also quite good!"	
Message	None	"(C-Can you choose dishes with all those ingredients?
Where did this game invest all its resources...??)"	
Message	Shido	"...A-Anyway, just try to win.
If you don't win against me, you won't be able to see
the victory screen, after all."	
Message	Tohka	Yes, I know. Come at me from any angle!	
Message	Shido	"――Gah!
Who would use their special attack at this timing!?"	
Message	Tohka	What's wrong Shido! Even Kotori was better!	
Message	None	"(...This is bad. Tohka's been unwittingly trained by Kotori!
If I go easy on her here, I'm in big trouble...)"	
Message	None	"(No, wait a minute!
If I fought honestly and Tohka's mood was worsened,
worst-case scenario, she could possibly rampage...?)"	
Message	None	"(No no, wait wait!
If she finds out she didn't win fair and square,
conversely wouldn't she get angry?)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! What are you spacing out for?
There is no need to go easy on me!"	
Message	Shido	――Urgh!	
Message	None	(While I was thinking she got in a really good one!)	
Message	None	(Alright! I've made up my mind! With Tohka, I'll――)	
Choice		Fight with her seriously.	
Choice		Give her some slack while fighting.	
Message	None	"(I'll fight Tohka seriously!
This is Tohka, if I went easy on her...
She'd easily see through it and get angry.)"	
Message	None	"(If I do things seriously, and I end up winning fair and square,
if that's the outcome of the match, then Tohka's sure to accept it!)"	
Message	Shido	"Not yet! It's not over yet!
Tohka! This is where it really begins! Let's go!"	
Message	Tohka	Hrm!? Come at me, Shidooooooo!	
Message	Shido	N-No way...it can't be...!	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! You're delicious-looking Shido! So much cheese!	
Message	None	"(...I-It's impossible.
In the first place, cooking a human and eating them
is totally wrong for a kid-oriented game...)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm, you seem quite stunned Shido.
Perhaps you lack the practice to go up against me?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...it's true that I haven't played recently...	
Message	Tohka	Hrm...it's no good. Staring at the screen is making me hungry.	
Message	Shido	I-It's almost dinner, after all...let's end here for today.	
Message	Tohka	"Yes. If you wish to battle me again, just ask anytime.
Oh! That's right!
Next time, I will make you into ankake fried rice!"	
Message	Shido	...I'll practice.	
Message	None	"(No, I should go easy on her.
 If I fought her seriously, and Tohka gets completely knocked out,
 I have no idea what'll happen to Tohka's mood...)"	
Message	None	"(Besides, this is technically a date, so if that's the case,
 so I should think the top priority is making Tohka happy.)"	
Message	Shido	Y-You're good Tohka! Your powerful attacks are amazing!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! This is not all of my power!
Soon I will make you into a juicy hamburg steak!"	
Message	Shido	"Whoah!? What is that attack!?
I can't dodge!"	
Message	None	"(I pretended not to know her special attack,
 and intentionally made a small hop into taking it head-on.
 With this, I lose.)"	
Message	Shido	A-Are you serious...! It takes that much off your health at once!?	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, that attack...
Didn't you already know you could dodge that with emergency evasion?"	
Message	Shido	Er...Well, it's been so long, I didn't remember.	
Message	Tohka	"...I thought this was a serious match, but I am quite disappointed, Shido...
You were going easy on me, weren't you?"	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka!? W-What's the matter?	
Message	Tohka	"Shido...If you are to battle me, I wish you would do so seriously.
No matter the reason, being decieved by you...
Well, it makes me very sad..."	
Message	Shido	...! ...I-I'm sorry.	
Message	Tohka	Hrm...it's no good. Staring at the screen is making me hungry.	
Message	Shido	I-It's almost dinner, after all...let's end here for today.	
Message	Tohka	"Hm. Hey, Shido...the next time we battle,
I request that it'll be "all in," okay?"	
Message	Shido	R-Right. Next time, it'll be a serious match!	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! If I win next time, what should I change you into next?
Should it be ankake fried rice?
Or maybe, gomoku fried rice?"	
Message	None	"...I guess either way it's decided I'm going to become fried rice.
Hrrmmm..."	
Message	None	――I wouldn't want either...yeah.
