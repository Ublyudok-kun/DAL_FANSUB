it felt like we were communicating on a deeper

Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kotori	What should we do now?	
Message	Shido	Hm. Look at the time. We could eat dinner.	
Message	Shido	"I'll treat you to a deluxe fast food meal since
you love it so much."	
Message	Kotori	YAY! Just what I wanted, Shido!	
Message	Kotori	But that doesn't tickle my fancy anymore.	
Message	Shido	Haha. Fair enough. We could get something else.	
Message	Kotori	On second thought, I'll eat it.	
Message	Shido	You're never honest with yourself.	
Message	Kotori	"What? Besides, what if people see me scarfing
it down?"	
Message	Shido	I mean, who cares what you eat, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	Wh-What are you saying?!	
Message	Shido	Hahaha...

All the fun and chaotic memories faded away,
and soon years had passed...)"	
Message	None	(At last, we had time for ourselves.)	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Yeah?	
Message	Kotori	Are you happy?	
Message	Shido	Of course I am.	
Message	Kotori	Ah, glad to hear it.	
Message	Shido	What the heck? Why do you ask?	
Message	Kotori	Oh? Feeling curious?	
Message	Shido	Yes, I am.	
Message	Kotori	Then, let me explain...	
Message	None	"(Honestly, it didn't matter. All that mattered
was that we were happy.)"	
Message	Kotori	We'll always be together.
