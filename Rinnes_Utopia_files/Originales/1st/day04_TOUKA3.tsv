Message	Shido	"Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm sure everyone's
hungry, right? Um, I'm not Rinne, but... Let's go
ahead and eat."	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...? Y-You're gonna eat too, right?	
Message	Tohka	Mm... I-I will...	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... L-Let's eat...	
Message	Kotori	"Then I'll eat, too.
Shido, could you turn the TV on?"	
Message	Shido	Sure...	
Message	Female Announcer A	"...Putting more effort into making Tengu Tower a\ntourist hotspot, in time for the opening of the\nNeo Tengu Tower."	
Message	Female Announcer B	"The Tengu Tower monument built last year was the\nfirst of many planned efforts to draw visitors\nto the site."	
Message	Female Announcer A	"That's right, and the monument was rebuilt with\nthe help of the design team responsible for the\nconstruction of the Neo Tengu Tower."	
Message	Kotori	"Oh hey, it's the Tower. Maybe they're doing
a special because it's on its way out."	
Message	Shido	Oh! Kotori, can I have a second?	
Message	Kotori	What? What's wrong?	
Message	Shido	"About Tengu Tower... There's something that I've
been wondering about."	
Message	Kotori	"Curious about a tourist hotspot? Well, look who's
suddenly on the bandwagon."	
Message	Shido	That's not what I mean! The monument!	
Message	Kotori	"Monument? Oh, the place where everyone meets for
dates because it's so original?"	
Message	Shido	Th-That's not what I'm trying to say...	
Message	Kotori	Then what is it?	
Message	Shido	"A-Actually, this morning while heading to school,
we took a detour and passed by the Tengu Tower."	
Message	Shido	While we were there... The monument felt strange.	
Message	Kotori	"You'll have to elaborate, unless you want me to
think you were just feeling up the monument."	
Message	Shido	"I don't understand what happened, but it started
glowing all of a sudden. Like, woosh!
Right, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Hmm? I did not see it...	
Message	Shido	Huh? Oh, er... That's right. Sorry.	
Message	Kotori	Shido. What's going on exactly?	
Message	Shido	"Well, um... When I thought I saw the monument
glow, Tohka suddenly said she wanted to go back..."	
Message	Kotori	"Hmmm... Maybe you said something to make Tohka mad
without realizing it?"	
Message	Shido	Well... I can't say that's not a possibility...	
Message	Kotori	"Besides, the monument may have some sort
of lighting installed inside of it."	
Message	Shido	"But even if that were the case, wouldn't it be
strange for it to glow so early in the morning?"	
Message	Shido	"Let's say you're right, and the monument does have
lights installed inside it. Tohka was still acting
really weird... It's difficult to describe, but..."	
Message	Kotori	I see... So that's a possibility, too.	
Message	Kotori	"The same thing that happened with the viewing
platform..."	
Message	Shido	That's right. And at that time too, Tohka was...	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What was the matter with me?	
Message	Shido	Er... It's nothing.	
Message	None	"(I can't say exactly what's on my mind when she's
right in front of us...)"	
Message	Shido	"A-Anyway, Tohka spaced out, and then after that we
immediately headed to school."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-When did I ever space out?!	
Message	Shido	"No, you just looked like you did...
You don't remember at all?"	
Message	Tohka	Hm... I have no idea what you are speaking of.	
Message	Shido	"I-I got it! It's possible that I was the one who
was spacing out! Haha... hahaha..."	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san... Are you... still feeling sick...?	
Message	Shido	Oh... No, I'm fine, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	"I-If... you're fine, Shido-san...
then, that's good..."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Good grief! This is what happens when Rinne-chan\nstops taking care of you! Did you push yourself so\nthat Yoshino would worry? Such a bad boy, Shido～"	
Message	Shido	"Yoshinon... Not every guy is a gigolo who breaks
women's hearts."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, but I wonder～ You may just not have seen\ntheir tears because they hide them from you～?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Really?	
Message	Yoshinon	"There are some types who hurt people without even\nrealizing it～."	
Message	None	(Wh-What...? Does everybody think so?)	
Message	Kotori	"Yoshinon, no matter how much you try to explain to
this idiot, you're wasting your time.
It's totally useless."	
Message	Shido	Wha―?	
Message	Kotori	"He's that old trope of the nice guy with good
intentions who unwittingly makes a mess of things.
But, no! He doesn't mean it! Super annoying..."	
Message	None	(Oof...! That actually stings.)	
Message	Kotori	"And it's because he's so good-natured that
everyone is inexplicably drawn to him..."	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	"―A-Anyway, I'll do some investigating on the
lights you were talking about just now."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I mean, yeah... but...	
Message	Kotori	What? Is there something else?	
Message	Shido	"Well... since we're on the subject, um...
That monument, how long has it been there...?"	
Message	Kotori	"*Sigh*... I take back everything I said. What are
you even saying? Is your head really okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Urgh...! I-It was hard for me to bring up since I
knew you were going to say that. But you were the
one who told me to report anything suspicious..."	
Message	Kotori	...I suppose so.	
Message	Shido	"I know this sounds weird, but if you saw a
monument like that, you wouldn't just forget about
it, right? But I had no memory of it at all..."	
Message	Kotori	"...This is an unexpectedly serious injury. It
might be a good idea to have you examined
at headquarters. Listen. That monument was―"	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Kotori	If I remember, it was there...	
Message	Shido	If you remember...?	
Message	Kotori	"...Since construction first began on Neo Tengu
Tower. They just said so on TV. It was the only
thing anyone talked about at the time, wasn't it?"	
Message	Shido	...How long ago was that?	
Message	None	"(How long ago was the Neo Tengu Tower built
in the first place?)"	
Message	Kotori	"Construction started the year before last. Are you
sure you're all right?"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... Maybe something's wrong with me after all.
I'm starting to doubt myself more and more..."	
Message	Kotori	"Just a few days ago, you were unconscious with a
high fever. It probably baked all the pudding in
your brain."	
Message	Shido	"I feel like that at least started out
compassionate. Probably shouldn't
admit that I'm hungry now..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm... Does everyone like the
Tengu Tower this much?"	
Message	Shido	"No, I think people just want to go see it one last
time. People get excited about big events like
this, seeing as things won't be the same after."	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm... That means... from now on it's the age of
the Neo Tengu Tower?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I guess so...	
Message	Tohka	"Th-Then... could we go on a date again
once it opens?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Sounds good. Why don't you? Take the old baked
pudding up there and have yourself a picnic."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, when did we decide on referring to my brain
as pudding?"	
Message	Kotori	"If you want, I've got a few other names.
But they're not as nice."	
Message	Shido	Ngh...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, kind-hearted Shido-kun? You'll be taking my\nYoshino as well, won't you? To the rumored\nNeo Tengu Lover's Paradise?"	
Message	Shido	"Lover's Paradise...? You know we're talking about
just a tower, right?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"So what is it? Do you intend on keeping Yoshino\ncrying alone in the shadows, Shido-kun?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Y...Yoshinon! I-If you say something like that...
Shido-san will... feel embarrassed..."	
Message	Shido	"A-All right, then! When it's open, let's
all of us go together! All right?
You're fine with that too right, Kotori? Tohka?"	
Message	Kotori	I-I never said I wanted to go.	
Message	Kotori	"...But, if you feel like you'll have your hands
full, I guess I could go as a chaperone..."	
Message	Shido	"Then, it's settled. We're all going together.
All right?"	
Message	Kotori	F-Fine then...	
Message	Shido	Are you okay with that too, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...! It is one step ahead!	
Message	Yoshinon	"*Whistle*～! Boy, it sure is hard being popular!"	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yoshinon... I'm begging you, please don't stir
things up anymore..."	
Message	Kotori	By the way Shido, have you realized...?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Realized what?	
Message	Kotori	You're the only one who hasn't finished eating.	
Message	Shido	Oh...
