Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Reine	Hi... Shin...	
Message	Shido	What are you doing here?	
Message	Reine	"Oh, nothing... When I'm in the preparation room
alone, I can't help but feel sleepy..."	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, Reine-san... You always seem
so sleepy. Maybe you should get some rest."	
Message	Reine	"No, I don't have such time... Even if I did...
I probably wouldn't be able to fall asleep."	
Message	Shido	Why not?	
Message	Reine	It's a secret. For now...	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Reine-san...?	
Message	Reine	Hey, Shin... Have you seen Kotori today?	
Message	Shido	"She went to school as usual...
Is something the matter?"	
Message	Reine	"Hm... I promised Kotori that I'd share with her
the results of the Fraxinus investigation, but
it seems as though she's completely forgotten."	
Message	Reine	"I have a packed schedule, so I need
to get it to her ASAP..."	
Message	Shido	"I'm sure she'll come to see you later on,
won't she?"	
Message	Reine	"I guess you have a point... I should just give it
to her when she gets here, huh... Well, I'll be
off then."	
Message	Shido	Oh, okay... Have a nice day.	
Message	Reine	Shin... Do you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Reine-san? What is it?	
Message	Reine	"You see... We were in the middle of investigating
what was wrong with the Fraxinus, when we received
a warning to all involved staff."	
Message	Shido	Is it some kind of emergency?	
Message	Reine	"I'll be sending you the message... So if you could
read it, that would be great."	
Message	Shido	Okay. Uh...	
Message	Shido	"How to set the flag for the childhood friend
route...? Be sure to check out all the date spots
and take her to the aquarium..."	
Message	Shido	...What is this?	
Message	Reine	"Oh, oops, wrong one... I seemed to have brought my
notes on the gal game walkthrough that I'm
currently developing at the Fraxinus."	
Message	Shido	What are you even doing there?!	
Message	Reine	Work...	
Message	Shido	Oh. Well... I guess that's true, but...	
Message	Shido	Reine-san...	
Message	Reine	Yes, Shin. What are you doing?	
Message	Shido	"...As usual, you have no plans to remember my
name, huh? My name is Shido. How many times
do I have to tell y—"	
Message	Reine	O-Oh, right... That's right. I apologize, Shin.	
Message	Shido	Argh... Whatever. It's fine.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Reine-san...?	
Message	Reine	Oh, Shin. Perfect timing.	
Message	Shido	What's the matter? What are you looking for?	
Message	Reine	"Oh, you see... While investigating the anomaly,
the crew of the Fraxinus also thought to conduct
investigations within town, but..."	
Message	Shido	"So you got roped into it too, huh? You also have
work to do at school... It sure seems challenging."	
Message	Reine	"Well, it's not that big of a deal. However,
it does seem as though I'm lost. I'm not
used to this part of town."	
Message	Shido	"Lost? If you tell me where you're headed, maybe I
can guide you."	
Message	Reine	"Yeah... That would be great. You see... I wish to
return to the Fraxinus..."	
Message	Shido	"I don't know how to get there!
Actually... why don't you contact the Fraxinus?!"	
Message	Reine	Oh... You're right. I didn't think of that.	
Message	Shido	What?! Come on... Jeez...
