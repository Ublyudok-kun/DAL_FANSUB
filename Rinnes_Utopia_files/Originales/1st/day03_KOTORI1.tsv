Message	Shido	"All right. Another day, another date to go on.
Hm... Should I ask Kotori?"	
Message	Shido	Okay, I'll give her a call.	
Message	Shido	Oh...? A phone call? From Kotori?	
Message	None	(I was just about to call her.)	
Message	Shido	Hello?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, Shido? I need to talk to you..."	
Message	Shido	What's up, Kotori? Perfect timing.	
Message	Kotori	"...What are you talking about?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I was just about to call you, too. I was
wondering if you wanted to go on a date."	
Message	Kotori	"...I see. Well then, I'm at the park, so hurry\nup and get over here."	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Th-The park? Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"Later..."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, wait, Kotori... I thought you called me
because you needed to talk to me."	
Message	Kotori	"Well... It seems my business was done for me."	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"...If you can't tell, I had the same idea as\nyou. Later."	
Message	Shido	"Same idea... Wait, so does that mean Kotori
wanted to go on a date with me?"	
Message	Shido	"She didn't seem too interested in the idea
yesterday... That's troublesome."	
Message	Shido	Anyway, where's Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Shido, this way.	
Message	Kotori	You're late.	
Message	Shido	Well, I came as soon as you called...	
Message	Kotori	Don't talk back to me!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Sorry.	
Message	Kotori	Well, let's sit down on this bench.	
Message	Shido	"Huh...? We're not going somewhere else?
It's a date..."	
Message	Kotori	"What's wrong with the park? It's quite
nice out."	
Message	Kotori	"Besides, it's not like you're rolling in the
dough. If you keep going on expensive dates,
then it'd be hard on you, right?"	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, yeah. I guess I gotta stick to my
budget..."	
Message	Shido	"But... I also feel like chilling on a park
bench is sort of a lame date."	
Message	Kotori	"I already said I'm fine with it. So it's fine.
Now hurry up and sit down!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay then...	
Message	Kotori	So, just checking...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it?	
Message	Kotori	What you said yesterday wasn't a lie, right?	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that?	
Message	Kotori	"That if there was anything I needed, you
said you'd do it. Is that true...?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes...	
Message	Kotori	Well, I have a favor to ask of you.	
Message	Shido	Oh, what is it?	
Message	Kotori	"But if I ask this of you... you may look at me
funny."	
Message	Shido	"I won't. Just tell me. If you need a favor, you
can count on me. I'm your brother, after all."	
Message	Kotori	...Really? You said anything, right?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Y-Yeah?	
Message	Kotori	"I will ask once more... You'll do ANYTHING,
right?"	
Message	None	"(K-Kotori looks serious. What is she going
to make me do...???)"	
Message	None	"(B-But I already gave her my word. I can't
back down, can I...?)"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Anything.	
Message	Kotori	...I see, then—	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Kotori!!	
Message	Kotori	OUCH! Hey, don't move your feet!	
Message	Shido	Whoa, s-sorry... Hey!	
Message	Shido	What is this?!	
Message	Kotori	"...What? Have you never seen anyone
lay on a lap before?"	
Message	Shido	That's not what I meant!	
Message	Shido	"B-But you're laying on my lap...
In public, no less..."	
Message	Kotori	Public... There's no one else around.	
Message	Shido	Really? Yeah, b-but...	
Message	Shido	But still...	
Message	Kotori	"You said you'd do anything. This isn't a big
deal."	
Message	Kotori	Or, were you lying to me...?	
Message	Shido	I-I wasn't lying...	
Message	Kotori	Then, shut up and enjoy it!	
Message	Kotori	"Your adorable little sister is tired, so do
your part in letting her decompress."	
Message	Shido	Okay, but...	
Message	Kotori	What, you got a problem?	
Message	Shido	It's not like that, but...	
Message	Kotori	Then shut up and let me do it!	
Message	Shido	"*sigh*... Okay, okay. Fine. But if someone
comes, we're stopping, got it?"	
Message	Kotori	I know, I know. Even I know when to stop.	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	～♪	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori...?	
Message	Kotori	Don't talk to me! I'm relaxing right now...	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... Sorry.	
Message	Kotori	～♪	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	Zzz...	
Message	None	(D-Did she fall asleep?!)	
Message	None	"(Oh man... Then I can't move until she wakes
up...)"	
Message	Kotori	Zzz...	
Message	None	"(Kotori... must be exhausted. If she's napping
like this, how can I stop her...?)"	
Message	None	"(She seems relaxed, at least. From this angle,
the color of her ribbon is nice...)"	
Message	Shido	...Whoa!!	
Message	None	(Her skirt is, uh, shifted...)	
Message	None	"(Should I wake her up to let her know, or
should I let her keep sleeping...?)"	
Message	None	(What am I supposed to do?)	
Choice		Kotori is a lady. I should wake her.	
Choice		She's still a child. I'll let her sleep.	
Message	Shido	Hey... Hey, Kotori?	
Message	Kotori	...Hmm?	
Message	Shido	"Um, I feel bad because you were sleeping
so soundly, but..."	
Message	Shido	Um... It's visible.	
Message	Kotori	Huh...?	
Message	Kotori	Aah... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!	
Message	Kotori	Sh-Shido... What are you thinking?!	
Message	Shido	W-Wait... I was just warning you...	
Message	Kotori	Shut up, shut up, shut up!	
Message	Kotori	"I-I can't just stand around here! Let's get
out of here!"	
Message	Kotori	...You pervert.	
Message	Shido	Th-That's so unfair...	
Message	None	"(If I point it out, I'll disturb Kotori's nap.
I guess it doesn't matter if it shows. It's
what Kotori would want.)"	
Message	None	"(Besides, Kotori's still just a kid...
She, um... trusts I won't do anything.)"	
Message	Kotori	Mm...	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Shi...do...?	
Message	Shido	O-Oh hey... You're up, huh...	
Message	Kotori	I fell asleep... Aah! Huh?!	
Message	Kotori	Aah... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!	
Message	Kotori	H-Hey! Wh-What's going on?!	
Message	Shido	O-Oh...?	
Message	Kotori	"You bastard. You saw the state I was in,
and you kept quiet...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, uh, what do I say? You were napping
so peacefully. I felt bad waking you."	
Message	Kotori	M-My brother... is a pervert!	
Message	Shido	Aah!	
Message	Kotori	Shido, forget you!	
Message	Shido	Ouch. I guess staying quiet wasn't smart...
