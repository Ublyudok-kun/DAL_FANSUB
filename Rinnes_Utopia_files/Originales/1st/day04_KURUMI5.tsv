Message	Shido	"All right, I'll go. That way, I'll just get it out
of my head."	
Message	Shido	"There's still a lot of people around. Guess
the tower's still open."	
Message	Kurumi	...Oh, Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	Hm...? Kurumi? What are you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	"Well, Shido-san, couldn't I ask you the same
question?"	
Message	Shido	Well, I was curious about something.	
Message	Kurumi	My, as was I.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san?!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it?!	
Message	Kurumi	Could... Could this be a barrier?!	
Message	Shido	Y-You mean—?!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	What the hell is that thing?!	
Message	Shido	A-An angel?! Is that... an angel?!	
Message	None	"(Not like the "Spirit" angels, but more like
a boss monster from a video game...)"	
Message	???	...	
Message	Kurumi	It appears to be warning us. Not to go near.	
Message	Shido	So, there IS something going on here!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Wh-Whoa!	
Message	Kurumi	It's dangerous!	
Message	Shido	?!	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! 	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, don't move.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehehe. This is getting interesting!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Kurumi	"Aha... Ahahaha! I sensed something dangerous,
but is this all?"	
Message	Kurumi	The fun... is just beginning!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Did it stop moving...?	
Message	Kurumi	Now, let's put this to an end, shall we?	
Message	???	...	
Message	Shido	Kurumi! 	
Message	Shido	"It's disappearing. Almost like... the Spirit's
Astral Dress is disappearing."	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san, are you hurt at all?	
Message	Shido	N-No, it's all thanks to you, Kurumi.	
Message	Shido	Did you... do it? What was that thing?!	
Message	Kurumi	"Good question. I have no idea. It may, however,
be related to my investigation."	
Message	Shido	"Kurumi, are you investigating the barrier
around Tengu City?"	
Message	Kurumi	"That's a secret. That is, unless you promise to
be mine, then I can tell you."	
Message	Shido	Well, no thanks to that...	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. How unfortunate. Are you going home
now?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I've had dinner to make, anyways.	
Message	Kurumi	"Then, I will escort you close to your home.
Something treacherous may appear again."	
Message	Shido	N-No. I couldn't let you do that for me.	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe, but you can rely on me in times like
these. Letting you go alone is too risky."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, fine. I guess I could take you up on
your offer."	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. A night walk would do us good.	
Message	Shido	"So, that's what happened. I managed to get
out safely, all thanks to Kurumi."	
Message	Kotori	...So?	
Message	Shido	Uh. That's it, really.	
Message	Kotori	"So just because you're good, you think
everything's fine?"	
Message	Kotori	What the hell, brother?!	
Message	Shido	Ugh!	
Message	Kotori	"Why are you going around like that without
telling me? What would I do if something
happened to you?!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry... I-I didn't mean to worry you.	
Message	Kotori	"Do you have any idea what your body is going
through right now?! You don't even have powers!
How many times have I told you?!"	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, it's all my fault.	
Message	Kotori	Well, at least you're safe.	
Message	Shido	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"I'll have people investigate the monument
immediately, but..."	
Message	Kotori	"Because of your reckless actions, there's a
chance the Spirits might go berserk. Next
time, be sure to consult with me."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... I promise.	
Message	Kotori	"As long as you know. The barrier covering Tengu
City seems related to this, but we won't know
until we get some results."	
Message	Shido	Right... 	
Message	Kotori	"I hope you'll make some progress, then. Leave
the situation to us. Shido, you just continue
looking after the Spirits."	
Message	Shido	Right. Got it.	
Message	Kotori	"Also, you've been spending too much time
with Kurumi recently. I know you know, but
she's dangerous. Just keep your guard up."	
Message	Shido	I'll remember that.	
Message	None	"(But...seeing Kurumi, I can't help but worry
about her. There's something there, I'm sure.)"
