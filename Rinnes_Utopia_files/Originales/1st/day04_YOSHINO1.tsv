Message	None	(All right. I'll take Yoshino out to have fun!)	
Message	Shido	I'm home!	
Message	None	"(Huh... No greeting from Yoshino? Is it possible
she's not here...?) "	
Message	None	"(I thought maybe I'd take her to the amusement
park for once, but...)"	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san... Welcome... home...	
Message	Shido	Oh, so you were here.	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoo-hoo, Shido-kun!	
Message	None	(Yoshinon is energetic as usual...)	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... I'm home, Yoshinon.	
Message	Shido	"I wanted to ask... Do you know what an amusement
park is, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san... Welcome... home...
U-Umm..."	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoo-hoo, Shido-kun! Don't you have something you\nwant to say～?	
Message	Shido	Something I want to say...?	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	......	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh, right...
Yeah, I do have something to say."	
Message	Shido	"Thank you, Yoshino and Yoshinon.
The bunny in the bento made me happy."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes!	
Message	Yoshinon	Good for you, huh, Yoshino!	
Message	Shido	"...Since you made such a cute bento for me,
I have to thank you somehow."	
Message	Yoshino	N-No... You don't have to...	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to hold back.
I want to thank you both."	
Message	Yoshino	B-But...	
Message	Yoshinon	Now now, no need to be so modest, Yoshino.\nOh, Shido-kun. Yoshino's just being shy!\nOf course we're happy for a thank you!	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... As thanks... Let me see...
Yoshino, do you know what an amusement park is?"	
Message	Yoshino	Th-The amusement park?!	
Message	Shido	Oh, so you do know it.	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I saw it... on TV, before.
I-It said it's... a very fun place..."	
Message	Shido	"That's right. That amusement park.
Do you want to go today, together?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?!	
Message	Shido	"It's to thank you for today's bunny...
If you really don't want to accept,
then I won't push it..."	
Message	Shido	"Well, I know you're not good with crowds, Yoshino.
But I thought it might be good to change things up
once in a while and go have some fun."	
Message	Shido	"It's important to get used to people, too...
Of course, if you really don't want to,
then I won't push it..."	
Message	Yoshino	Ahh... Ohh... Wh-What should I do, Yoshinon...?	
Message	Yoshinon	There's no point in asking me～ You're the one\nwho's getting invited, so you have to decide for\nyourself～	
Message	Shido	"That's not true. It's just as much an
invite to thank you too, Yoshinon."	
Message	Yoshinon	Really?! How charming of you, Shido-kun.\nEven Yoshinon might end up falling for you～	
Message	Shido	Hahaha... So, what do you want to do?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino, let's be honest with ourselves.\nShido-kun's being honest too, you know?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'll, go! Please... t-take me there.	
Message	Shido	"All right. Then, it's decided.
Go ahead and get ready. Let's get going!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes!	
Message	Yoshino	A-Aahh...	
Message	Shido	There are a lot of people here...	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes, there are...	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What... should I do, Yoshinon...?	
Message	Yoshinon	...I don't think there's really anything Yoshinon\ncan do～	
Message	Yoshino	"Wh-Wha...?
Don't say that... Yoshinon..."	
Message	Yoshinon	Rather than rely on me, there's someone else here\nyou should rely on first, isn't there～?	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	It's all right. Give me your hand.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...	
Message	Shido	Here... If we hold hands, then you can't get lost.	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... Y-Yes.	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san, your hand... is warm... it makes
me feel better."	
Message	Shido	"...I see, that's good.
Then, let's get going.
Keep a tight grip!"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...!	
Message	Yoshinon	......	
Message	Shido	You too, Yoshinon! Right?	
Message	Yoshinon	Of course!	
Message	Shido	"Well, a date at the amusement park... There are
lots of different rides, but which one to get
on...?"	
Message	Kannazuki	Hello there, Shido-kun. It seems you were\nsuccessful in taking Yoshino out on a date.\nFrom here on is the true battle!	
Message	Shido	Kannazuki-san?!	
Message	Kannazuki	Shido-kun, have you decided which attraction\nyou'll be guiding Yoshino through?	
Message	Shido	"No, I haven't really decided or anything yet...
Could it be... a choice selection?"	
Message	Kannazuki	No, unfortunately the Fraxinus' functions haven't\nfully returned, so we are not able to formulate\npotential choices with our distinguished AI.	
Message	Shido	...That's good.	
Message	Kannazuki	But rest assured! An expert in the field will\noffer you advice... And that would be me!	
Message	Shido	What?! Is that... really all right?	
Message	Kannazuki	What are you saying? Leave everything to me!	
Message	Shido	R-Right...	
Message	Shido	I'm worried...	
Message	Kannazuki	This time around, it's an amusement park date...\nThere are two potential approaches.	
Message	Shido	I see... What are the two approaches?	
Message	Kannazuki	The first is haunted house tour! Is this pounding\nof the heart from fear or from love? Either way,\nthis is sure to draw you two closer together!	
Message	Shido	"Is that the Suspension Bridge effect?
I've heard of that."	
Message	Kannazuki	At the right moment, if you let out a scream and\nhold onto Yoshino, she's sure to unleash a rolling\nsobat, and you'll be able to ascend!	
Message	Shido	"I'm the one who's holding onto her?! More
importantly, this is Yoshino, remember? She's not
Kotori. She wouldn't counterattack like that..."	
Message	Kannazuki	Oh... Of course I knew that. Don't you worry.	
Message	Shido	"You just said, ""Oh,"" didn't you?! Can't you take
this seriously?!"	
Message	Kannazuki	The other approach is to set the stage for a\npeaceful time together. Ride the ferris wheel and\ntalk of love while gazing at the distant sky...	
Message	Shido	"Don't ignore me!
But, well, I see... Putting aside the love part,
that does sound fun on its own."	
Message	Kannazuki	If circumstances allow, you may find yourself\nembracing Yoshino, only to have her kick you out\nof the window and watch you dive from its peak!	
Message	Shido	Didn't I say that's more Kotori?!	
Message	Kannazuki	Either way, there's no mistake that you should\nsteal Yoshino's heart! The choice is yours,\nShido-kun!	
Message	None	(Why is my heart... full of uncertainty...?)	
Choice		Go to the haunted house!	
Choice		Go on the Ferris Wheel!	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino...
Would you like to go to the haunted house for now?"	
Message	Yoshino	Haunted... house...? Isn't that... scary...?	
Message	Shido	"Well, I suppose it is scary... But it's the fun
kind of scary. I'll be with you the whole time,
but... do you not want to go?"	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I'll... go...
If I'm... with you, Shido-san... I'll be fine!"	
Message	Shido	All right, let's go!	
Message	Yoshino	...!!	
Message	Yoshino	...Ohh!!	
Message	Yoshino	...Eeek!!	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, it's all right...	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Yoshinon	Ahh, getting handsy in here, Shido-kun?!\nJust because it's dark!	
Message	Shido	Wha... Er, no. Sorry, I... Yoshino, your hand...	
Message	Yoshinon	Good grief! I can see your lewd intentions from\nhere! How concerning... Here, go to the other\nside!	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Sorry... Thanks, Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshino	...Oh...	
Message	Yoshinon	*Whistle*～! You two are such a cute match!	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's hand grabbed mine so tightly, I could
almost feel her heart beat in her hand...)"	
Message	None	"Either way, it looks like the haunted
house was a success."	
Message	Shido	For now, let's get on the ferris wheel...	
Message	Yoshino	Ferris... wheel...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, look... It's that big wheel over there.
If you go up to the top, you can see a really
nice view."	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes... If it's... where you're going, Shido-san...
Anywhere is fine..."	
Message	None	(...All right! That feels good!)	
Message	Shido	Okay, then let's go.	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"See? How is it, Yoshino? The ground is getting
farther away."	
Message	Yoshino	...Y-Yes, it is.	
Message	Shido	"Look, you can see Neo Tengu Tower
over there, too..."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes.	
Message	Shido	H-How is it? Isn't it fun?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...	
Message	None	"(Hmm, it's kinda awkward when she won't respond
back... I have to liven things up somehow...)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa!	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san...! Are you okay...?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah... I'm totally fine.
H-How was it, Yoshino? Was it fun?"	
Message	Yoshino	The sky... was pretty...	
Message	None	(That's sort of a roundabout response...)	
Message	Yoshino	"If I'm... with you, Shido-san...
I'm always... having fun..."	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, really?!	
Message	Yoshino	Yes, it... doesn't have to be... a high place...	
Message	Shido	I-I see. Hahaha... I'm glad to hear that...	
Message	Shido	"All right, then, let's try getting
on something else."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...!	
Message	Yoshino	A...Aahh...	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! A-Are you okay, Yoshino?
Are you scared of the rollercoaster?"	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'm... fine...	
Message	Shido	"Whew, the rollercoaster was a bit much.
Even I got a little scared."	
Message	Shido	"All right... Next, let's go to Labyrinth Busters.
We can have a laser-tag battle!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you're pretty good!
Your aim is true. I can't lose, either..."	
Message	Yoshinon	Go! Do your best, Yoshino!\nShido-kun ran off that way! Take him down!	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Shido	"...Whew. I completely lost.
You're surprisingly good at this, Yoshino."	
Message	Yoshino	"Th-That's... not true.
Yoshinon... did her best too, so..."	
Message	Shido	Right, I see. Yoshino, are you having fun?	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes... I'm very happy...
that I came to... the amusement park with you...!"	
Message	Shido	"All right, then I'll stay here with you for the
rest of the day!"	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes!	
Message	Yoshino	Ah... Ohhh... Wh-Whoa...	
Message	Shido	Here, Yoshino! Step on the brakes here!	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes... Go!	
Message	Shido	Oh, looking good! You're great at this!	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you're catching on!
All right. Here goes!"	
Message	Yoshino	Yah...! Yah...!	
Message	Shido	I won't let you! Come on, I'm gonna pass you!	
Message	Yoshino	"Shido-san, there were... a lot of firsts for me...
and it was a lot of fun!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I had tons of fun, too.
Right, Yoshinon? You think so too, right?"	
Message	Yoshinon	......	
Message	Yoshino	...Yoshinon?	
Message	Shido	Huh? Did he not hear?	
Message	Yoshinon	Yeah, you're right... It was fun, Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah...	
Message	Shido	"All right, let's get back into
it for the last lap!"	
Message	Yoshino	I was able to... ride a lot of rides!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, you look like you're satisfied. If you're
happy, Yoshino, then it was worth coming here."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Shido	"You were a little quiet today, Yoshinon. I thought
you'd comment more on Yoshino's driving..."	
Message	Shido	It's kinda unusual, what's up?	
Message	Yoshinon	...Well, you know～	
Message	Shido	Hmm...?	
Message	Yoshinon	...Yoshino's... fine now, isn't she...?	
Message	Yoshino	...Yoshinon?	
Message	Shido	"...It looks like you're really trusted.
Good thing, huh, Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	Oops, it's already late. We'd better head home.	
Message	Shido	"Before that... Yoshino, could you wait here for
just a moment?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Wh-Where... are you going?	
Message	Shido	Er, just over there...	
Message	Yoshino	I-I'll... come with you...!	
Message	Shido	Ah... Er... Sorry, Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	Why not...?	
Message	Shido	"Well... I can't take you to the
men's restroom, right?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh? Oh...!	
Message	Yoshino	Th-The bathroom.... S-Sorry...	
Message	Shido	Yeah, so I'll be right back...	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...	
Message	Shido	Whew... All right, Yoshino is... Oh, there she is.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Umm...	
Message	Yoshinon	...So that's how it is～	
Message	None	"(Yoshino and Yoshinon are talking? I wonder why it
feels like it's a complicated conversation...)"	
Message	None	"(I kinda feel like I shouldn't interrupt... But
still, I wonder what they're talking about...?)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Hey, Yoshino. You're still a kid, aren't you～?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yeah...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino, do you still want to stay a kid?\nOr do you want to become an adult～?	
Message	Yoshino	I... think I... want to be an adult...	
Message	Yoshinon	...I see～	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon...?	
Message	Yoshinon	You want to be an adult\nbecause of this, right...?	
Message	Yoshino	"...?!
T-That's, um... Well..."	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshino, do you know how a kid is able to become\nan adult～?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I don't know...	
Message	Yoshinon	Yoshinon thinks it's probably like this～	
Message	Yoshinon	When you're relying on your parents,\nyou're still a kid...	
Message	Yoshino	Parents...?	
Message	Yoshinon	Yup, that's right～\nI think you might have started to realize too,\nYoshino. That it's... almost time...	
Message	None	(Sh-Shoot...)	
Message	Yoshinon	...Hm?	
Message	None	(...Yoshinon noticed me!)	
Message	Yoshinon	...Oh, Shido-kun. You're already back～?\nYou should have told us if you were back～	
Message	Shido	Ah, er... Sorry, did I get in the way?	
Message	Yoshinon	No, it's fine, it's fine～ We were just gossiping\nabout you, Shido-kun.	
Message	Shido	...I-I see.	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Yoshinon	Man, today was lots of fun～\nLet's go home now!	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah, you're right.
All right, Yoshino... Let's go home."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes.	
Message	Yoshinon	Boy, today was a really fun day!\nYoshinon probably won't ever forget about today!\nYoshino looked so happy...	
Message	Yoshinon	"I wonder what Yoshinon's happiness is.\n	
Message	Yoshinon	""I wonder if Yoshino's happiness is really\nYoshinon's happiness, too..."
