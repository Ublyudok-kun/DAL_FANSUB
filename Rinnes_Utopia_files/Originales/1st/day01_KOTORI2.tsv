Message	Shido	A transmission? Who's it from?	
Message	Kannazuki	Hello...? Oh, Shido-kun! I'm glad I got\nahold of you.	
Message	Shido	...Kannazuki-san? What's the matter?	
Message	Kannazuki	Don't 'what's the matter' me! I tried to\nperform my usual reporting, but I can't\nseem to get ahold of the commander.	
Message	Shido	Kotori...?	
Message	Kannazuki	Yes, the commander mentioned that she\nhad a meeting at school today, so I was\nhoping she'd be somewhere nearby.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, then would you like me to visit Reine?
Oh, wait..."	
Message	Shido	Hey, I see her... I found Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	What is it...? Who are you talking to?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. It's Kannazuki-san. He said he couldn't
get ahold of you, so he was checking in with
me."	
Message	Kotori	"...Checking in? Oh, come to think of it, I was
washing my face earlier and didn't check my
phone."	
Message	Shido	You were washing your face?	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, I was feeling groggy.	
Message	Shido	Gotcha...	
Choice		I wonder if she's tired. Be kind to her.	
Choice		Is she getting lazy? I gotta warn her.	
Message	Shido	"Kotori, have you not been getting much sleep?
Don't push yourself too hard. If you faint, then
it'll all be for nothing."	
Message	Kotori	"...! Hey, what are you talking about?! This is
a desperate time. Just when am I supposed
to let my guard down?"	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	"Argh! Shut up! If you have time to worry about
me, then you should be worrying about the other
Spirits!"	
Message	Shido	WHOA!	
Message	Kotori	What's the point of hitting on me?!	
Message	Shido	I-I was only... watching out for you...	
Message	Kannazuki	"Ahhh, Shido-kun! What an honor, to be\nstrong-armed by the commander. What I\nwould give to be in your position!
Message Shido K-Kannazuki-san...
Message Shido Hey, are you all right? You're the commander of the Ratatoskr, right? Are you slipping up?"""	
Message	Shido	GWAH!	
Message	Kotori	"Ratatoskr is none of your concern. Don't talk
to me like you know what you're talking about!"	
Message	Shido	*whimper*... Okay.	
Message	Kannazuki	Aww. The commander elegantly told you\nto put a cork in it... I'm so envious! If you\ncould, please teach me your ways!	
Message	Shido	...I-I wouldn't recommend it.
