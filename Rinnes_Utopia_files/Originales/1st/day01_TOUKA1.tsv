Message	Shido	Hm? Is that Tohka over there?	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Oh, were you waiting for me?	
Message	Tohka	Mhm. I thought I should apologize for what happened at lunch.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. It's all right. I just thought I saw the light at
the end of the tunnel... that's all."	
Message	Tohka	I-I apologize, Shido... I put too much of my all into it...	
Message	None	(Is that really the issue here?)	
Message	Tohka	But I am glad you're alright, Shido!	
Message	Tohka	"I stayed so long in the infirmary that they
threw me out, and I was worried about you."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Tohka	Mhm! Alright then, let us head home!	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Yes? What is it?	
Message	Shido	If you'd like to, well... do you want to stop by someplace?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Stop by... a place?	
Message	Shido	What I mean to say is... let's go on a date.	
Message	Tohka	Oh! Y-Yes! I think that is a great idea!	
Message	Shido	I guess suggesting it was a good idea. I'm glad you're into it!	
Message	Tohka	Oh, yes! A date with Shido! A date, a date!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Tohka, calm down...	
Message	Guy Student A	Woo, buddy! A date after school with this cutie, huh?	
Message	Guy Student B	Scandalous! Simply scandalous!	
Message	Girl Student A	Explode... explode... just explode and die!	
Message	Girl Student B	S-Senpai?	
Message	Tohka	"Shidooo! What are you doing?
Let us hurry and go on our date!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I get it! But, um, why don't we try being a little quieter?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Why?	
Message	Shido	"W-Well that's... um, it's kind of awkward
to explain when you ask me so bluntly..."	
Message	Shido	"Why are you so excited in the first place?
It's not the first time we've gone on a date, you know."	
Message	Tohka	"Of course I'm happy!
I'm going on a date with you, after all!"	
Message	Shido	R-Right.	
Message	None	(Why is it so embarrassing for her to say that?)	
Message	Girl Student A	I need to buy some pins on my way home...	
Message	Girl Student B	S-Senpai... you're really scaring me today!	
Message	Shido	"T-Tohka... I feel like we're gonna get cursed
if we stay here any longer."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm! Is there an enemy that can curse us?!
That's quite dangerous..."	
Message	Shido	"Uh, well it's not exactly an enemy, per se,
but I am sensing some hostility..."	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? What's this?
Shido! Over here!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? What is it?	
Message	Tohka	Just come over here!	
Message	Shido	Hey!	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant* The... shopping district?	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	Shido	"Why the shopping district?
There are plenty of other places for a date..."	
Message	Tohka	The smell!	
Message	Shido	The s-smell?	
Message	Tohka	"It smells so good! From there...
and over there... this must be heaven!"	
Message	None	(Ah. She meant the smell of food...)	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't know about heaven, but...
since we're here, why don't we eat?"	
Message	Tohka	Ooh! Are you truly alright with that, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"I guess so. This might be more of a
food sampling than a date, though..."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What did you say?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing. What did you want to eat?	
Message	Tohka	Mmm... well, Shido, I do not have very much currency...	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry about it. I can cover you,
so let's just eat, alright?"	
Message	Tohka	Is that truly alright?!	
Message	Shido	A date is when a man is supposed to show off.	
Message	Tohka	"Ah... is that so? I understand! Then,
I will gladly allow you to treat me!"	
Message	Shido	Perfect. So, what do you want to eat?	
Message	Tohka	Mmm... let us go there first!	
Message	None	(Tohka pointed enthusiastically towards a takoyaki stand's sign.)	
Message	Shido	"Takoyaki, huh? Sounds good.
Wait, did you say "first"?"	
Message	Tohka	Let us go, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Ah, hey! Tohka――	
Message	Shido	Ack! I-If you stick so many in your mouth at once then――	
Message	Tohka	Urph! Hoff, hoff! T-Thiff iph—	
Message	Shido	You okay?!	
Message	Tohka	"Mmm... the outside is so fluffy and crisp!
The inside is hot and melty!"	
Message	Shido	Hahaha, that's what's delicious about takoyaki.	
Message	Tohka	*Munch*	
Message	Tohka	*Munch snarf*	
Message	Tohka	*Munch munch munch*	
Message	Shido	H-Hey... Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Mmm! That was quite delicious!	
Message	Shido	I'm glad you liked it. Next time I'll buy—	
Message	Tohka	Shido, what is that?!	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh, that. It's a kebab sandwich st―	
Message	Tohka	"Kebab? It smells wonderful!
Shido, let's go there next!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Just wait a second!	
Message	Shido	Here, this is a kebab.	
Message	None	"(While Tohka couldn't tear her eyes away from the giant chunk of
meat being spit-roasted, I gently handed her a kebab sandwich,
so that the sauce wouldn't spill out.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm, so you sandwich meat and vegetables?
Mmm... mmmph?!"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh... oh my! Juicy meat, lightly charred...
crisp vegetables... and this sauce...
this is an absolute masterpiece!"	
Message	Shido	You like it, huh?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! One could get addicted to this taste!
Hm? Shido, what restaurant is that over there?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, that? That's a revolving sushi place.	
Message	Tohka	Hm, so this time this "sushi" is being rotated?!	
Message	Shido	"W-Well, something like that. They put a bunch
 of different sushi on a plate and―"	
Message	Tohka	Alright! Let's go, Shido!	
Message	Shido	I-I said just wait up a sec!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm! This sushi is quite refereshing,
I could have eaten many more plates!"	
Message	Shido	No, I don't think I... could have. Oogh...	
Message	Tohka	Really? Then, next is...	
Message	Shido	"Just a second! Why don't we take
a small break? I'm getting really full..."	
Message	Tohka	Are you alright, Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"You don't have to worry that much.
I just ate too much, so if I rest a bit..."	
Message	None	"(What's not alright is the contents of my
wallet but I did say I'd treat her, so that's
hard to bring up...)"	
Message	None	"(After a lot of deliberation, we entered an air-conditioned
game center, and decided to take a break while cooling down.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka ended up stopping in front of a crane game.
Inside, a bunch of cute stuffed animals were heaped inside.)"	
Message	Shido	Do you want one?	
Message	Tohka	Er, ah... you do not want one, Shido?	
Message	None	"(Hm... Tohka definitely looks like she wants one.
Is she trying to hold herself back?)"	
Message	Shido	"I mean, they are pretty cute.
Alright, I'll give it a go!"	
Message	None	"(Operating the button to move vertical, then operating the
button to move horizontal. Then, aim carefully...)"	
Message	None	(Ah?!)	
Message	Tohka	Hrm.	
Message	None	"(The crane grabbed at the stuffed animal's head as if giving
a playful bite, then just as easily let go, before returning
to its original position, dangling limply.)"	
Message	None	(Rgh. Just a little more, but it's surprisingly hard to get.)	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka! I'm going to give it my all, so watch closely!	
Message	Tohka	Of course! I will leave it to you, Shido!	
Message	None	"The crane started moving towards its target,
as if possessed by my will..."	
Message	Tohka	S-Shido... it's okay... don't push yourself.	
Message	Shido	This is my battle! My battle!	
Message	Tohka	Shido?	
Message	Shido	Rgh... I swear that I'll get it!	
Message	Tohka	Hrm...	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	It's fine, it's fine. Just believe in me like you did before.	
Message	Shido	Rgh!	
Message	None	Just a little more, just a little more...calm down, and concentrate!	
Message	Shido	Haaaah...	
Message	None	(I can see it, the drop of water!)	
Message	Shido	THEEEERE!	
Message	Shido	I... DID IT! I did it, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Oh, wow! You did it, Shido!	
Message	Shido	Yeah... here, you take it.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Shido? But why?	
Message	Shido	"It was lots of fun. This was just a bonus.
It's my gift to you."	
Message	Tohka	"Hehe, thank you, Shido!
Aw, there there..."	
Message	None	"(I thought we spent quite a lot of time at the game center,
but actually it wasn't so long. The sun hadn't set yet.)"	
Message	None	"(But thanks to that, the contents of my wallet were running low.
This expense is nothing if I get to see Tohka's smile though, right?)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hey, Shido, I am a bit hungry.
Why don't we have some kinako bread?"	
Message	None	"Oogh. A-Are you serious?!
My stomach's still full from before..."	
Message	None	"If I keep following Tohka like this,
my wallet and my stomach won't last..."	
Choice		A-Any more food is gonna be too much for me...	
Choice		Then, why don't we stop by the bakery?	
Message	Shido	"Actually... do you mind if we hold off on food?
We're gonna have dinner later too."	
Message	Tohka	"Hrm... y-you're right! Actually, I really didn't
want to eat it that bad anyway so... yeah!"	
Message	Shido	"You really wanted that kinako bread, huh?
I'm sorry..."	
Message	Tohka	"N-No... it's fine. Please just take care
of yourself. No need to worry about me."	
Message	Shido	"Alright. Hey, you've been holding that plushie
this whole time. You must really like it."	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! You worked so hard to get it, after all!
I will most definitely take care of it!"	
Message	Shido	Hah, yeah. It was worth it.	
Message	None	"(Well, my wallet's contents depleted heavily,
but as a result it was a huge success.)"	
Message	None	"(All's well that ends well! I guess we
were able to have a decent date... right?)"	
Message	None	"Well, I suppose if we've come this far,
it doesn't make a difference if we eat or not..."	
Message	Shido	Alright, then let's head to the bakery!	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	Bakery Worker	Welcome!	
Message	Shido	Two kinako breads, please.	
Message	Bakery Worker	I'm terribly sorry. We're all sold out for today.	
Message	Tohka	Oh! What?!	
Message	Shido	I-I see... then we'll come by another time.	
Message	Bakery Worker	"Oh, sir! It may not be exactly a replacement,
but why not try our new item, whipped cream bread?"	
Message	Bakery Worker	"It's just been baked, I highly recommend it!
What do you think, would you like to try?"	
Message	Shido	Hm... then two of those, please.	
Message	Tohka	"Curse them... to think they've been all bought up...
as expected of kinako bread... such a devilish taste
that tempts humanity..."	
Message	Shido	No, it was just a coincidence. These things happen sometimes.	
Message	Tohka	Is that so? That is a shame.	
Message	Shido	"Don't make that face. Here, have this.
The clerk pushed it so much, so I'm sure it's delicious."	
Message	Tohka	So this is whipped cream bread...	
Message	Shido	"Doesn't it smell sweet and fragrant?
It seems delicious, right?"	
Message	Tohka	"Its scent does stimulate my appetite.
I'll try it right now..."	
Message	Tohka	*munch* Hm?!	
Message	Tohka	"What an indelible sweetness!
It's unfortunate that I can eat only one!"	
Message	Shido	I-I'm glad you like it...	
Message	None	(Her appetite is really staggering...)	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what's wrong? Will you not eat, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh, no... hey Tohka, it's sticky all around your mouth.	
Message	Tohka	Hm? Here?	
Message	Shido	"Hey! If you wipe it with your sleeve,
you're gonna get your uniform all dirty!"	
Message	Shido	Here, look here for a second.	
Message	Tohka	Mm! I-I apologize!	
Message	Shido	It's okay...	
Message	None	"(I feel like I was pulled around the whole time by
Tohka, but this sort of date isn't so bad.)"
