Message	Shido	"Ah. Maybe I ate too much. Rinne's food is just
so delicious that I can't help overeating."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Yes...?	
Message	Kotori	Shido, are you here?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but... what's up?	
Message	Kotori	I was going to take a bath, but we're out of shampoo.	
Message	Shido	Oh, we were running low, weren't we?	
Message	Kotori	"So you already noticed and didn't do anything
about it? Ugh."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry, I just forgot.	
Message	Kotori	"Sorry won't fix it. Go to the store and get some right
now if you're really sorry. You wouldn't dare say
no, would you?"	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay. I'll go buy it.	
Message	Kotori	You better hurry or I'll... I'll do something!	
Message	Shido	I get it! Just hold on.	
Message	Kotori	Hmph...	
Message	Shido	Ugh. Kotori's so bossy...	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, hi, Shido-san. Good evening.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh. What are you doing out this late?	
Message	Kurumi	Sometimes, the night is just more convenient...	
Message	Shido	Uh... what are you doing?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. That's a secret.	
Message	Shido	I see. I guess I won't ask anymore then.	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh? You're not curious? I mean...
what if I happen to be eating people?"	
Message	Shido	You aren't though... are you?	
Message	Kurumi	Eh? Why would you assume that?	
Message	Shido	"Well, you said you didn't plan on it.
At least for right now, anyway."	
Message	Kurumi	Heh. Yes, I mentioned something like that.	
Message	Kurumi	"I will leave it to your imagination to guess what
I was doing. Now then... good night, Shido-san."	
Message	Shido	She's always saying the most suggestive things.	
Message	Shido	I better let Kotori know that I saw Kurumi lurking around.	
Message	Shido	I'll tell Kotori as soon as I get home.	
Message	Shido	I'm home. I bought the shampoo, Kotori!	
Message	Shido	"Did everyone fall asleep? Well, whatever.
I'll take a bath while I still can."	
Message	Shido	"Now that we have more people living with us,
we're always fighting for the bathroom. I gotta
take advantage of this while I can."	
Message	Shido	Oh? Someone left the light on?	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	Shi...do?	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori...? What are you...?	
Message	Kotori	What? Why are you in a daze?	
Message	Shido	Oh. Uh... u-uh... I just bought some shampoo...	
Message	Kotori	You idiot! You idiot brother!	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry! It wasn't on purpose!	
Message	Kotori	You ready?	
Message	Shido	W-Wait. Can we talk about...	
Message	Kotori	Ugh. You're hopeless.	
Message	Shido	"I-I said I'm sorry. We used to bathe together
back in the day. What's the big deal?"	
Message	Kotori	Did you say something?	
Message	Shido	"Nothing, nothing at all!
I want to tell you something."	
Message	Kotori	Are you trying to change the subject?	
Message	Shido	No, when I went to get shampoo, I saw Kurumi.	
Message	Kotori	"What?! You saw Kurumi?!
Are you okay? Did she do something?"	
Message	Shido	No, we just talked a little.	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Kurumi is dangerous. Be careful out
there. Ugh, another problem to deal with..."	
Message	Shido	Sorry...	
Message	Kotori	"If you're able to seal her, I'd say this
might be a good opportunity for us..."	
Message	Shido	Considering last time... I'm sure it's easier said...	
Message	Kotori	Good point. Oh well.	
Message	Shido	"So what about things on your end?
Were you able to find anything out?"	
Message	Kotori	"Nothing. We had observed the Spirits' reaction
throughout Tengu City, but... that's all we know."	
Message	Shido	Is there no way to look into it further?	
Message	Kotori	"We could've if it was possible, but we can't
get a hold of headquarters so there's nothing
we can really do."	
Message	Kotori	"We're in the middle of a big phenomenon though.
And I think Tengu City is in the center of this big
change. That's all I can say for sure."	
Message	Shido	I see.	
Message	Kotori	Don't give me that look.	
Message	Shido	But...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, your job is to go on dates with Spirits and
stabilize them. If a girl dates a guy with the face
you're wearing, they'll only feel worse."	
Message	Shido	Sorry. I looked that glum, huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah, and it worries me. Shido, you need
to act normal or the Spirits won't feel at ease."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Rinne	Alright, I'll be borrowing your kitchen then.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sorry for the trouble all the time.	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you promised not to say that, right?
Next door neighbors help each other out, after all."	
Message	Shido	"Of course. If there's ever anything I can help with
at your house Rinne, you can always ask me."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, Shido. But I don't think there's anything right now?	
Message	Shido	It's true, you do have it together, Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	...Is that so? I hope so...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	It's nothing. Alright then, I'll prepare things quickly.	
Message	Shido	Alright, I'll be watching the pot on my end. I'll leave that side to you.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Leave it to me.	
Message	Rinne	Today's meal is meat and potato stew.	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! This is quite the delicious smell!	
Message	Shido	Everyone's here, right? Then, let's eat!	
Message	Tohka	Yes!  Let us eat!	
Message	Kotori	Yeah! Time to eat!	
Message	Yoshino	L...Let's eat!	
Message	Tohka	It's fluffy and delicious, Shido...!	
Message	Shido	You're right, this is definitely a motherly flavor.	
Message	Tohka	Motherly flavor?	
Message	Rinne	Umm...I guess you could say it means, a nostalgic sort of taste?	
Message	Shido	That's right. I wonder why, the taste is reassuring.	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm. I see...
Then I must aim for a motherly taste when I cook!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? You, cooking...?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I can do something like cooking too, Shido.
I make such things like cookies occasionally too..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's right. Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Tohka-chan, would you like seconds?	
Message	Tohka	Yes Rinne, please!	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you're welcome.
Don't rush too much and spill it."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Leave it to me!	
Message	Shido	Good grief...
