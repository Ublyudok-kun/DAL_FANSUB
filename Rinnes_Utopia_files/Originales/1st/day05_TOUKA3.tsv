Message	None	"(Now, then... It's good that I invited Tohka out
on a date tomorrow, but will she really
go with me...?)"	
Message	None	"(Well... It's not like I have
any particular plans.)"	
Message	None	"(No... If I try thinking too hard, I'll just mess
up again. So I just have to throw my feelings
at her, and let them shatter if they will.)"	
Message	None	Now, and from here on out―	
Message	???	Sh-Shido...?	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?! Why are you here...?	
Message	Tohka	I... heard from Rinne...	
Message	Shido	F-From Rinne...?	
Message	Tohka	Yes...	
Message	None	"(...Had I told Rinne that I was going here?
W-Well, whatever... That's not important
right now...)"	
Message	Tohka	Hey, Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hm! Wh-What is it...?	
Message	Tohka	How do you... feel about Rinne, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Huh? H-How...? Well...	
Choice		Just a childhood friend.	
Choice		Someone I'm interested in.	
Message	Shido	She's just a childhood friend, of course.	
Message	Tohka	Hm...? Rinne is... your ideal wife, is she not?	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Tohka	Y-You know, that thing... m-marriage!	
Message	Shido	M-Marriage?!	
Message	Tohka	"Marriage is when two people who love each other
promise to be together forever, yes? So, Sh-Shido,
you... you said Rinne was an ideal wife, right?"	
Message	Shido	Th-That's... Well, you see...!	
Message	Tohka	I knew it...	
Message	Shido	No! That's not it! Don't misunderstand me!	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	I-It's true that Rinne would make a good wife...	
Message	Tohka	Ngh! See, I knew it!	
Message	Shido	P-Please, just hear me out!	
Message	Tohka	Hm...	
Message	Shido	"But right now, I don't think of Rinne in that
way... And I'm not planning on marrying her."	
Message	Tohka	I-Is that true...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah...
And right now, the one thing I'm sure of..."	
Message	Tohka	...?	
Message	Shido	Right now... I want to be with you, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	...?!	
Message	Shido	"So, Tohka... Please keep your promise
for tomorrow. Or... will you not?"	
Message	Tohka	I-I can, absolutely...!	
Message	Shido	"Really?! Then, it's all right?
Haha, I'm looking forward to it."	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, then, tomorrow... I'm...
looking forward to it as well."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah. I-I'll see you tomorrow!	
Message	None	(Whew... I feel like my feelings got through.)	
Message	None	"(There really are times when you just have to face
a person with your true feelings.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, my head's cooled off, I guess I'll go home
and get ready for tomorrow...)"	
Message	Shido	"To be honest... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
interested, but..."	
Message	Tohka	I knew it...	
Message	Shido	Hmm...? Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"So, I really... have no place...
in your future, Shido...?"	
Message	Shido	Huh, er, no... I, um―!	
Message	Tohka	*Sniffle*! *Sob*...!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Tohka?! Are you okay?!	
Message	Tohka	I... don't... want...! To not... be with Shido...!	
Message	Shido	"Wha―! Tohka! This is bad! At this rate...!
Please calm down!"	
Message	Tohka	UWAAAAAAAH!!!!	
Message	Shido	A-Aaagh! UWAAAAAHHH...?!	
Message	None	(All right, tomorrow's my date with Tohka...)	
Message	None	"(I don't know if there's anything I can do...
But I want her to go back to her normal self.)"	
Message	None	"(I'll try not to think too hard about things, and
just face her with the feelings I have as I go.)"	
Message	Shido	Yes? Come in...	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne? What's wrong, all of a sudden?	
Message	Rinne	There was something I wanted to ask you, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Something you wanted to ask me?	
Message	Rinne	"Yes, I wanted to ask you.
Shido... You've decided, haven't you?"	
Message	Shido	Er, ah... Yeah...	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Rinne	You decided that... You want to save Tohka.	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Yeah. I can't watch Tohka be like this,
and I can't leave her alone. Not only that,
but Tohka was trying her best for me―"	
Message	Shido	"You want to be by Tohka's side...
That's what I'm thinking."	
Message	Rinne	I see. So that's your answer, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. That's what I've decided.	
Message	Rinne	......	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido... Can you promise me something?	
Message	Shido	Promise...? What...?	
Message	Rinne	"Promise that from now on, you'll cherish
Tohka-chan. No matter what happens,
you won't let her go... Promise me."	
Message	Shido	"Wh-What are you talking about?
You don't have to ask me to do that..."	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise me. That you'll only
think of Tohka-chan... Otherwise, I'm sure that
your heart will one day distance itself from her."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	Please...	
Message	Shido	"I understand... I promise.
As a man, I won't take back what I've said.
I'll... cherish Tohka, absolutely."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... I knew you would promise me, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Haha, what do you mean by that?	
Message	Rinne	"I believe in you, Shido...
Don't forget your promise... Don't ever break it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course.	
Message	Rinne	If you break it, you won't get off easy, okay?	
Message	Shido	I-I know!	
Message	Rinne	I see... Then it's good.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What is it? Why do you have to threaten me?	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	But...	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Rinne	"You'll be fine.
If it's you, you'll be fine... I'm sure of it."	
Message	Shido	...?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What was that just now?!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rinne... Did you just see―	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Rinne's gone?
When did she...?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, it is pretty late...
I should head to bed as well."	
Message	???	"...In this dream... no one can become happy...
Shido Itsuka... I hope your next dream will be
a happy one..."
