Message	Shido	"*Pant, pant*...! I have to hurry...
and find Yoshino..."	
Message	Shido	"...Rain?!
It wasn't raining a second ago..."	
Message	Shido	Wait. Over there... Could it be...?	
Message	Shido	...Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	Yoshino! Hey, what's wrong?	
Message	Yoshino	...Shido...san...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's right.
Are you okay? What happened?"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino! Hey, Yoshino!
Stay with me, Yoshino! What happened?!"	
Message	Yoshino	......Ah...	
Message	Yoshino	...*sniffle, sniffle*...Y-Yoshinon, is...	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-She's... n-not... m-moving... any... anymore...!	
Message	Shido	What... Are you serious...?!	
Message	Yoshinon	......	
Message	Shido	Yoshinon isn't moving anymore... What do you mean?	
Message	Yoshino	"Even if I... talk to her... she won't... answer...
And she won't... talk to me..."	
Message	Shido	"It's not a prank, is it?
Maybe she'll move suddenly and say,
""Got ya,"" or something..."	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I don't know... I...I didn't know...
what to do..."	
Message	Shido	Was it you... who called earlier?	
Message	Yoshino	"Y-Yes... but... it wouldn't... connect...!
I was scared... of being... alone...!"	
Message	Shido	A chill...!	
Message	Yoshino	...*Sniffle*...!	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, please! Please calm down!
At this rate... You'll end up doing something
you can't take back!"	
Message	Yoshino	B-But... Y-Yoshinon is...!	
Message	Yoshino	I-I don't... want Yoshinon... to go away!	
Message	None	"(It's no use... With Yoshinon not moving,
Yoshino's lost all hope. But, I...)"	
Message	Shido	I... I won't let you be alone, Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	...?!	
Message	Shido	"I'll be by your side! I'll help you with Yoshinon,
too! So... Yoshino, stop! Please stop!"	
Message	Yoshino	*Sniffle*... *Sob*... Sh-Shido...san...?!	
Message	Shido	Please let me be with you!!	
Message	Yoshino	...?!	
Message	Shido	"For now... Let's head home. From there, we can
think about what to do about Yoshinon. Together...
Okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	......	
Message	None	"(There was no response from Yoshino. But in
return, she gripped my hand tightly.)"	
Message	Shido	Have you calmed down?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...	
Message	Shido	Still, I wonder what happened... to Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	......	
Message	Shido	"It's not like I doubted what you said, Yoshino...
But she's really not saying anything...
Even though she's usually so talkative..."	
Message	Yoshino	Maybe it... really is my fault...	
Message	Shido	No, I don't think that's true.	
Message	Yoshino	B-But...	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino... Let's stay calm, and think through this
carefully."	
Message	Yoshino	...Huh?	
Message	Shido	"Yoshinon is always on your side, right?
That's why I'm sure there's a reason for this.
A reason that Yoshinon had to end up this way."	
Message	Yoshino	A... reason?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I'm sure there was some thought behind it...
That's why, Yoshino..."	
Message	Shido	"We have to make sure we can properly welcome
Yoshinon back. So that Yoshinon can start moving
again anytime."	
Message	Shido	"If Yoshinon saw your expression now, she'd be sad,
you know?"	
Message	Yoshino	Yes. I'm... sorry...	
Message	Shido	"Let's rest a bit. We might think of something
if we get some sleep."	
Message	Yoshino	"Yes... I'll do that...
Shido-san... Good night..."	
Message	Shido	Good night...	
Message	Reine	Thank you for your work, Shin.\nIt seems Yoshino calmed down as well.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I'm glad. But with Yoshinon like this...
Yoshino's feelings will forever be in limbo."	
Message	Reine	Yes, you're right. However, on our end as well,\nwe currently have no idea as to the reasons behind\nYoshinon's symptoms.	
Message	Shido	"I figured...
I wonder why Yoshinon stopped moving..."	
Message	None	"(Now that I think of it... Yesterday, wasn't
Yoshinon saying something to Yoshino...?
I think it was...)"	
Message	Shido	"When you're relying on your parents,\nyou're still a kid..."" Was that it?	
Message	Reine	""Hm? What's the matter, Shin?\nIs there something bothering you?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... It's nothing. I'll try to think of anything
I can do about Yoshinon from my end.
See you, then..."	
Message	Reine	Yes, please do so.	
Message	None	"(I thought back on the words I heard Yoshinon
speak yesterday. Why did Yoshinon stop moving?)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshino has a lot of things she can't do on her
own, and Yoshinon always supported her...
but the two looked like good partners, and... Hm?)"	
Message	None	(I felt like something clicked.)	
Message	Shido	"Yoshinon. The reason you stopped moving...
Could it be... for Yoshino's sake?"	
Message	None	"(There was no answer.
But I believed that must be it.)"	
Message	Shido	"Wait just a bit, Yoshinon. Yoshino might not be as
much of a kid as you think she is, you know?"	
Message	None	"(Having said this to no one in particular,
I felt as if I heard a voice saying, ""Hmm,
I wonder about thatï½ž?"")"
