Message	Shido	Oh, where did Origami go?	
Message	Shido	I wonder if she's already back at the apartment.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, well. Guess I'll have to postpone my date
with her. Besides, I have to hit the market."	
Message	Shido	Oh, where did Origami go?	
Message	Shido	I wonder if she's already back at the apartment.	
Message	Shido	"Wait! Who's that person walking in the
shopping district...?"	
Message	Shido	All right. I'll check!	
Message	Shido	"OH! It's Origami! Did she enter... the book
shop?"	
Message	None	(Hm... Hey! There she is!)	
Message	None	(Hm. I wonder what book she's looking for.)	
Message	None	"(This bookshelf is, let's see... philosophy,
religion, and dark magic?!)"	
Message	Origami	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Yo Origami! Fancy meeting you here, huh?!	
Message	Origami	Were you following me?	
Message	Shido	...! W-Well, not exactly. Huh? Well, maybe...	
Message	Origami	I see. Then we are a good match.	
Message	Shido	U-Um. Yeah, we are. Right.	
Message	Origami	Fate.	
Message	Shido	S-Sure.	
Message	None	(Now for the elephant in the room...)	
Message	Shido	"A-Anyways, what was it you were looking for,
Origami?"	
Message	None	"(As soon as I asked, Origami presented me
the books in her hands.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hm. "The History of Barrier Magic", "Black Magic!
How to Form a Barrier", "100 Ways to Make Barriers
Fun!", "Barriers for Dummies"... What is this? OH!"	
Message	Shido	O-Origami, what are these...?	
Message	Origami	"We must fully examine our enemy in order to
come out victorious in battle. I am trying to
grasp what tricks the "enemy" may be hiding."	
Message	None	(I... I see. This is her way of helping us.)	
Message	None	"(Although I'm a little curious about her book
collection at the moment.)"	
Message	Shido	G-Gotcha. Thanks for all your help.	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. Your enemy is my enemy.	
Message	None	"(Oh! Now, to tactfully switch the conversation
to ask her out on a date. This is getting kind
of intense. What should I do...?)"	
Message	None	(Hm? Kannazuki-san?)	
Message	Shido	Origami, gimme a sec! I have a phone call.	
Message	Origami	Mm...	
Message	Shido	H-Hello?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Let me guess! You're currently with Origami\nTobiichi, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	What?! Are you monitoring me?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"She's not a Spirit, so I don't know the\ndetails, but I may be able to go after her\nin my head. Fear not!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? What does that even mean...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Understood. Then allow me to explain the\nrelation between human brains and their\npotential, so listen close—"	
Message	Shido	No thanks! Now's not really the best time.	
Message	Kannazuki	"I see. Well, that's unfortunate. So, what kind\nof situation have you found yourself in?"	
Message	None	"(Kannazuki-san has a tendency to complicate
things, but... I feel like I'm almost desperate
for ideas at this point.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, you see... I'm trying to ask Origami out
on a date, but—"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Ah, I see. You want to coax a smile out of her,\nhuh?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, yes. But I haven't been successful.
Honestly, I don't know what to do."	
Message	Kannazuki	"Got it. Then I'll propose two options."	
Message	Shido	Huh? There's a way?	
Message	Kannazuki	"If my brain monitoring is accurate, you can\nuse either of these methods to draw a smile\nout of her."	
Message	Shido	"Please, tell me how! What could I do?
Wait... Brain monitoring?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Remain calm, Shido-kun. Rushing it will\nonly result in failure."	
Message	Shido	Oh, sure. I'm sorry!	
Message	Kannazuki	"The first method was developed by compiling\ndata related to cerebrum physiology, psychology,\nand statistics."	
Message	Shido	A-All of that stuff?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Shido-kun, have you ever seen a baby laugh?"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Well, sure, who hasn't?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Don't you think they have magical smiles?\nWhen they smile, you can't help but smile\nback."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I think I see your point.	
Message	Kannazuki	"Babies smile instinctively, you see."	
Message	Shido	Okay...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Babies are born weak. In order for them\nto endear themselves to their mothers, they\nsmile out of reflex." 	
Message	Shido	Oh, really?	
Message	Kannazuki	"Yes, of course. As a result, the mother smiles,\nalong with anyone around them."	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Kannazuki	"You get it then, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kannazuki	"In other words, if you want to make someone\nsmile, you have to smile too! Flashing those\npearly whites is the best way to make it happen."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kannazuki	"Smiling is contagious. So why don't you\ngive it a shot?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	"(If we're talking about Origami, I think a smile
is the least contagious thing to her.)"	
Message	Shido	So, what else were you thinking?	
Message	Kannazuki	"The other method is use your best jokes."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kannazuki	"From what my intuition tells me, she's a\nvery intelligent woman."	
Message	Shido	Th-That's totally correct.	
Message	Kannazuki	"So someone with her intellect requires a\njoke with more substance, or she won't\nregister it as a joke."	
Message	Shido	R-Really...?	
Message	Kannazuki	"The more intelligent she is, the cleverer the\njoke needs to be. Use a high-brow joke, and\nshe'll be laughing in no time."	
Message	Shido	"I-I hope so... So what kind of joke should
I use?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Well, you see... *mumble, mumble*...\nSomething like that."	
Message	Shido	"U-Uh, I see. I don't really get it, but maybe
Origami will find it funny...?"	
Message	Kannazuki	"Well, that's for you to decide! Regardless\nof which choice you pick, be confident, and\ndo your best!"	
Message	Shido	G-Got it. Thanks for the advice.	
Message	Kannazuki	"No need to thank me. I wish you the best\nof luck!"	
Message	None	"(Hm. Guess that qualifies as advice. No
point in stressing about it, so maybe it's
worth a shot?)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Origami?! Are you done shopping already?!	
Message	Origami	I got a few books.	
Message	Shido	I-I see...	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Origami	Shido? What's the matter.	
Choice		Burst out laughing.	
Choice		Use a joke.	
Message	Shido	Origami...	
Message	Origami	Hm...	
Message	Shido	AHA! AHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	(D-Did it work? Was it not enough?! Then—!)	
Message	Shido	"WAHA! WAHA! WAHAHAHAHAHA!
WWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA! UAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHA... AHAHAHA... Haha...ha...ha...ha..."	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	None	"(I knew it wouldn't work! Who knew that
laughing was so tough!)"	
Message	Origami	"Shido, if you've ingested toxic mushrooms, I
suggest that you see a specialist. You should
be looked at immediately. I'll take care of it."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Origami	"Don't worry. I won't abandon you, no matter
what happens to you."	
Message	Shido	No, you're misunderstanding!	
Message	Origami	...Misunderstanding?	
Message	Shido	Uh, um. I'm sorry!	
Message	Origami	"Shido, if you're stressed and need to talk to
someone, I'm here at any time."	
Message	Shido	Oh! O-Origami!	
Message	None	"(She's gone. I'm never listening to Kannazuki-san's
advice ever again. Yeah...)"	
Message	Shido	Origami! Listen to me!	
Message	Origami	Hm...	
Message	Shido	"There once was a busy guy who interviewed for
a game company. The interviewer asked, "Why
do you want to apply at our company?""	
Message	Origami	...?	
Message	Shido	"The man replied, "Because you have lots of
days off. Not just that, but a master submission
break, too...""	
Message	Origami	...Shido? I don't get it.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... It's a high-brow joke. The kind you
need a couple seconds to register."	
Message	Origami	I see.	
Message	Shido	W-Was it boring?	
Message	Origami	I simply have no idea how it's relevant.	
Message	Shido	Oh! O-Origami!	
Message	None	"(Aw. I'm never listening to Kannazuki-san's
advice again.)"
