Message	Shido	"Today's Saturday. All right. I'll try inviting
Yoshino on a date."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	Good morning, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshino	Good... morning...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino still seems upset, but I knew she
wouldn't get over what happened yesterday
in one day.)"	
Message	None	"(But... I swear I'll help you smile again.
I'm sure that's what Yoshinon would want
as well.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yoshino. How would you feel about going
out today?"	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	Let's go on a date.	
Message	Yoshino	D...Date.	
Message	Shido	"Of course. If you don't want to though, Yoshino,
I won't force you."	
Message	Yoshino	Aah...	
Message	Shido	"Seems like you're not in the mood for it though,
huh?"	
Message	Yoshino	No... I'd like to... go.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Yoshino	"Please, take me out... I'm sorry... I can't
smile... well..."	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry about it. All right, let's go out!
Come on. Let's get dressed."	
Message	Yoshino	Y...Yes!	
Message	None	"(Yoshino, let's do our best. I whispered this
to myself as Yoshino went upstairs to change.)"	
Message	Shido	Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	Yes?	
Message	Shido	Let's hold hands.	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Shido	Do you not want to?	
Message	Yoshino	I don't... mind.	
Message	Shido	Then, here...	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	None	"(Yoshino's hand... feels colder than usual.
It's possible that because Yoshinon's not
around, she's become a little unstable.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Ah...	
Message	Shido	Now then, where would you like to go?	
Message	Yoshino	Ah. Anywhere is fine...	
Message	Shido	"I see. I mean, I didn't really have a plan
either. For now, let's get groceries?"	
Message	Yoshino	Sure.	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	None	"(I figure taking her outside isn't enough, but
I can't give up. I need to cheer up Yoshino, one
bit at a time."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino thinks of Yoshinon dearly. I want her
to hold onto those feelings.)"	
Message	None	"(But I also wonder a little. If her concern for
her friend is too high, is that hurting Yoshino?
Should she learn to be independent?)"	
Message	None	"(It's possible that if she were to forget
Yoshinon, she could find happiness.)"	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...san?	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. It's nothing.	
Message	None	"(I shouldn't think that. Yoshinon's my friend
too. I can't believe the thought crossed my
mind.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Aah!	
Message	Shido	What's wrong, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	...!	
Message	Shido	Ah, where are you going? Yoshino!	
Message	Shido	"*pant, pant*... Yoshino, you shouldn't run
off by yourself!"	
Message	Yoshino	"I-I'm sorry... B-But, Yoshinon's...! Yoshinon
is...!"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, is that...	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon!	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Are you saying that's Yoshinon...?	
Message	None	"(Sitting in the shop window was a bunny
plushie.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshinon! Why... are you... there?!	
Message	Yoshino	Aah...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Yoshino	Yoshi...non...	
Message	None	(I can't leave Yoshino alone like this.)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshino? Yoshinon's your friend, right?	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...?	
Message	Shido	"Yoshinon sometimes had a potty-mouth,
but was above all strong, kind, and friendly."	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah. Yoshinon is... my friend, after all.	
Message	Shido	Then, why don't we both put Yoshinon at ease?	
Message	Yoshino	Huh?	
Message	Shido	"I may have said this before, but if Yoshinon
saw you now, I think she'd be sad."	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	"To be honest, I don't know why Yoshinon
stopped moving, or how to revive her...
I don't know anything."	
Message	Shido	"But when Yoshinon comes back, I know how
to make her happy."	
Message	Yoshino	What is it...? How...?	
Message	Shido	It's by showing how much you've grown.	
Message	Shido	"To show Yoshinon that, even without her around,
you're fine on your own. That'd be for the best."	
Message	Yoshino	"B-But... Yoshinon really is important, and I
need her."	
Message	Shido	"I know, but with friends, you can't rely on them
forever."	
Message	Shido	"Hold both feet firm on the ground, and find
your own strength. Your friends will always
be there for you."	
Message	Shido	"Friendships are a two-way street. It's nice to
have someone to depend upon, but it has to
go both ways. You have to support them too."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino, that's what real friends are.	
Message	Yoshino	Real... friends?	
Message	Shido	"Right. That's why I'd like you to grow stronger,
Yoshino. One day, when Yoshinon comes back,
you can support her, too."	
Message	Yoshino	Me... supporting...	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshino	"I understand. I'm still sad, but... When
Yoshinon comes back, I-I'll... do my best!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Do your best, Yoshino!	
Message	Yoshino	Yes!	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, but... what should I do?	
Message	Yoshino	Oh, no... I... I have to think about myself, too.	
Message	Yoshino	"I'll... think about it, myself.
What I can do, for Yoshinon."	
Message	Shido	"Yup. You'll get it. It's okay to take it slow,
and go with whatever your heart says. If
you're ever in trouble, I'll be here."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes. Thank you...!	
Message	Shido	"Yoshinon's faced her sadness, and is learning
how to move forward."	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Yoshinon...? Your friend is kindhearted,
and a hard worker."	
Message	Shido	"The reason you left Yoshino behind is because
you knew this would happen, didn't you? You
know she could stand even without you."	
Message	Shido	"I know that whatever you do will always
be done for Yoshino's sake."	
Message	Shido	"But you know, Yoshinon, in the end, without
you here, Yoshino's brokenhearted. No one
knows how to deal with the loss of a friend."	
Message	Shido	"So... So that's why, no matter how much time
it takes, please come back Yoshinon."	
Message	None	"(Yoshino needs Yoshinon. She laughs most
when she's with Yoshinon.)"	
Message	None	"(Yoshinon, until you come back, I'll protect
Yoshino. One day, Yoshino will smile as big
as a sunflower again.)"
