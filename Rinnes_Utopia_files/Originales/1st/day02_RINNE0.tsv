Message	Tonomachi	"Oh, they're at it again! Those lacrosse uniforms are
so dang cute, huh, Itsuka? Things are heating up!"	
Message	Shido	Cool it, man. Can't you just cheer for them normally?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Come on, don't be so modest!
If I can't enjoy these uniforms now, will I ever
be able to again?! Life is so fleeting!"	
Message	None	(He's hopeless.)	
Message	Rinne	Heads up! Stay on your mark! Keep the pressure on!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Whoa! The lacrosse club really knows how
to strategize. They're doing great!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it looks like it.	
Message	None	(I wonder why... Rinne's face looks so dazzling to me...)	
Message	None	"(Rinne makes a really happy face when she's playing
sports. It's really refreshing to me.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Dang! It's no good! The other team is anticipating
their play!"	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Tonomachi	...! They got one in!	
Message	Shido	W-Who's winning?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"The score right now is 11 to 11. They just scored
the equalizer!"	
Message	Shido	What's an equalizer?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"We're already in the second half. There are
only five minutes left on the clock."	
Message	Shido	Can we win?	
Message	Tonomachi	I don't know...	
Message	Shido	Well, I figured...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Don't get so discouraged. I keep a minimum level
of knowledge on all the cute girls. I at least know the
bare minimum about the rules."	
Message	Shido	Really? You can actually be helpful!	
Message	Tonomachi	"A lacrosse game at a sports festival doesn't
go by official rules though. They're simplified."	
Message	Shido	How are they simplified?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Well, there are only six people on each team, yeah?
There are usually twelve. They call it soft lacrosse."	
Message	Shido	T-That's a lot of people for one team.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah, but other than that, it's pretty much the same.
You just try to get the ball into the other team's goal."	
Message	Shido	That sounds just like soccer.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yep. Lacrosse is more like hockey though, and you're
allowed to use the space behind the goal, and—"	
Message	Shido	And...?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Well, unlike soccer, before you shoot on goal,
you need to have passed the ball at least twice."	
Message	Shido	So you're forced to pass no matter what?	
Message	Tonomachi	"Yeah. That's why no matter how good Rinne is at
the sport, she can't just drive it to the goal by herself."	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	Tonomachi	That's not all. The other team is pretty smart, too.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Even with Rinne's stats, she has to completely rely
on her team. If the other team marks her, they'll
block all of her attempts too."	
Message	Shido	......	
Message	Rinne	Eeek!	
Message	Shido	R-Rinne?! Is she okay?!	
Message	Tonomachi	"*cough hack!* I couldn't see it because of the dust,
but the checks toward Rinne are getting more intense!"	
Message	Tonomachi	"That was a foul! This is... Whoa.
They're completely out to crush Rinne, Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Rrgh! Rinne! You have to win!	
Message	Tamae	"Oh my. The person coughing just now...
was it you, Tonomachi-kun?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh? Ah, T-Tama-chan... I mean,
 Okamine-sensei! What's wrong?"	
Message	Tamae	"I came to watch the lacrosse match, but it looks
like I have no time for that. Tonomachi-kun,
please follow me."	
Message	Tonomachi	O-Okay...?	
Message	Tamae	You don't seem well. I'm taking you to the infirmary.	
Message	Tonomachi	N-No, I'm really okay now so...	
Message	Tamae	No! I heard you coughing! Let's hurry and go!	
Message	Tonomachi	"H-Hey, Itsuka! Say something to her, too! You're
my friend, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	"S-sensei, even with all of his pain... he kept cheering
despite the agony it caused him... *sniffle*
Hurry, please take him before it's too late!"	
Message	Tonomachi	I-Itsuka?! You little―!	
Message	Tamae	"That's incredible! Tonomachi-kun, your selflessness
to cheer for our class is truly admirable! But,
you need to take care of yourself as well!"	
Message	Tonomachi	N-No, I'm telling you Tama-chan, this is―	
Message	Tamae	"This isn't the time for you to talk!
I will go with you too, so let's head to the hospital!
Now then, I will leave the cheering to you, Itsuka-kun."	
Message	Shido	Yeah! Leave it to me!	
Message	Tonomachi	G-GODDAMMIIIIIIIT!!!!	
Message	Shido	Ah, the sweet taste of victory.	
Message	Shido	"Whoa! Nice cut! What a pass!
Ah... but the clock is running out..."	
Message	None	(This is probably the last chance!)	
Message	None	(Damn! Rinne can't shake her mark!)	
Message	Shido	"HEY! Come on, don't do that!
You can't pass it to Rinne right now!"	
Message	None	"(I know why they want to pass it to her, but that's
exactly what the other team wants. Huh?!
Rinne missed the pass?!)"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, no! Rinne's teammate ran around from
behind and connected the pass!"	
Message	Rinne	Over here!	
Message	Rinne	Gotcha!	
Message	Shido	S-Shoot it, Rinne!	
Message	Rinne	HAH!	
Message	Referee	"The match is over! The final score is 12 to 11,
and the victory goes to 2nd year, class four!"	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe! We did it! We can thank everyone
for this victory!"	
Message	None	"(We can thank everyone for this victory...
Rinne's smile is so bright. I can't take my eyes
off of her.)"
