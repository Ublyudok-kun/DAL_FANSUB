Message	Shido	Where am I? Am I back in Tengu City?	
Message	Shido	What the—?! What is that thing?!	
Message	Shido	Is that Neo Tengu Tower?! What's going on?!	
Message	Shido	And where's everyone else?! Rinne's still separated from me!	
Message	None	"(Rinne, you're safe, right? Please, tell me you're just hiding
somewhere.)"	
Message	None	"(Come on. That has to be the case. I mean, she can't be gone. How
can Rinne be...)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido! You made it through!	
Message	Shido	Kotori?! Everyone! You guys are safe?!	
Message	None	"(...?! Kotori's wearing her Astral Dress.
Wait, are her regeneration powers back?)"	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. Seems like everyone got out. But...
There's something up with Tengu City.
Especially Neo Tengu Tower. It's ominous..."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, seems like it.	
Message	Kurumi	Is that all you're worried about?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, can I trust you as an ally?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. With regards to our situation, I promise to cooperate. I
refuse to be sucked in. Although, I do not intend on asking you to
trust me."	
Message	Shido	"Don't be like that. If you ask me to trust you, I will. A
temporary truce will do. Thanks for your help."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. I suppose I have no choice but to do my best when you put
it that way. Why the change of heart?"	
Message	Shido	"I'm... starting to remember. The memory of dating you is coming
back to me."	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, is that so? I have recollection of it.	
Message	Shido	"I can't blame you, but I remember it clearly.
Hence why I've decided to trust you."	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. I see. An interesting train of thought.
So that's his take, but what about you?
Glaring at me forever must be so tiring."	
Message	Kotori	If Shido says so, then I won't object.	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I think I believe you. So long as we share a common goal,
I'll trust you. You don't seem foolish enough to mistake our
predicament."	
Message	Kurumi	Compliment taken, I suppose.	
Message	Tohka	I was so worried about you, Shido! Have you been harmed?	
Message	Shido	I'm fine. How are you, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"F-Fine... I remember little, save for being flown back, but
nothing serious."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, what a relief. What about you, Yoshino?
You okay?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y...Yes! Glad to see you're safe, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Of course. Good to see you, Yoshino.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Heeeey! That's messed up, Shido-kun!\nI exist too, you know!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, sorry, sorry! Who knows what'll come next, so take care of
Yoshino, okay Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Man, you're such a sweet talker. Well, just like you said,\nShido-kun, Yoshino's got me, so no need to worry."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm counting on you.	
Message	Origami	Shido, what about me?	
Message	Shido	O-Origami?! Um, sorry for getting you involved in this...	
Message	Origami	I don't mind. If Ruler is a Spirit, then this concerns me as well.	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	Kotori	So what's the deal, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	None	"(I told Kotori and the others what I knew up till then. And how
Rinne hasn't made it back yet...)"	
Message	Kotori	Rinne is... gone?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. We were split up, and I haven't seen her since.	
Message	Kotori	I see. That worries me. So, have you noticed anything else?	
Message	Shido	Um, no. Not yet.	
Message	Kotori	Hm. Understood. We'll leave it there for now.	
Message	Tohka	But why is this Ruler going after Shido?	
Message	Shido	I don't know, but... I want to speak with Ruler again.	
Message	Shido	"I don't know why, but I've got a feeling that Ruler isn't a bad
person."	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"Let's make her stop this, and get all of us out of this once and
for all!"	
Message	Tohka	Yes! I'm here to help, Shido.	
Message	Shido	R-Really?!	
Message	Tohka	Yes, of course!	
Message	Origami	Me too.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	I told you. I can't watch you dive into danger.	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	Origami	Besides, Tohka Yatogami isn't enough to support you.	
Message	Tohka	HEY! What is that supposed to mean, Origami Tobiichi?!	
Message	Origami	"I mean exactly what I said. Your pre-school comprehension appalls
me."	
Message	Tohka	GRRRRR!	
Message	Shido	Hey, no fighting, you two! We're all on the same side here.	
Message	Tohka	Oh... Sorry!	
Message	Origami	If you say so, Shido.	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, there's no time. If we linger here, the world's going to
end."	
Message	Shido	"Then we've got no choice but to act! We won't let them destroy our
city! I'm still figuring out what Ruler's plan is."	
Message	Shido	"Why is she doing this? It's all unknown. If we could just talk,
then maybe we won't have to battle her."	
Message	Kotori	Shido, you optimistic dumbass.	
Message	Shido	What? I'm just doing what I can—	
Message	Kotori	"I didn't say it was a bad thing. Let's head to the enemy's base.
Ratatoskr's job is to aid you, Shido."	
Message	None	"(Everyone nodded silently. We all know the stakes. Ruler's waiting
for us at Neo Tengu Tower.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Normally, we'd leave you behind since you can't revive, but if
Ruler is in fact a Spirit, you may be able to seal her."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you're our only hope, but be careful.
Failure could mean your life."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know.	
Message	Kotori	Shido, we're right behind you. So when all of this ends...	
Message	Shido	You want me to take you to dinner...?	
Message	Kotori	You know me well... Promise?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I promise!	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido...san!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter?	
Message	Yoshino	Please, take care of Ruler-san. I... I will do my best to help!	
Message	Shido	Yoshino...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Wow. Look's all serious now, huh Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshinon... I'm always serious.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Right-o. Then, you can count me in."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	"I got a move or two I could bust out!"	
Message	Kurumi	Goodness, Shido-san. Such an angel, aren't you?	
Message	Shido	Wh-What do you mean?	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe. Nothing. Now that everything's set, shall we be on our way?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, I can't tell if you're being sassy.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, did it seem so? It can't be helped.
You're so kind to me."	
Message	Shido	It's not like that...	
Message	Kurumi	For you, I'd skin a thousand men, no matter the circumstances.	
Message	Shido	Wha... What?!	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. Unfortunately though, it'll have to wait.
First, we need to pay Ruler a visit."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah!	
Message	Kotori	"We don't have the luxury of time right now.
Let's go, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Got it! Okay, our next destination: Neo Tengu Tower! I know Ruler
is there!"	
Message	Kotori	Yes. The barrier's core has got to be there.	
Message	Shido	"The barrier's core? Wait, if we can destroy that, then we may not
have to fight Ruler."	
Message	Kurumi	"There's a chance. But before that, there's somewhere we need to
go."	
Message	Shido	Hm? There is?	
Message	Kotori	"According to my tests, there's a barrier surrounding Neo Tengu
Tower as well.
It blocks all outside entry."	
Message	Kurumi	"Right. We need to destroy the barrier's keystones, or we're stuck
out here."	
Message	Shido	"The barrier's keystones... Wait! Kurumi, remember? That means,
Tohka and Origami..."	
Message	Tohka	"Keystone. You refer to the monument in front of the tower,
correct?"	
Message	Origami	"And the outlet tower adjacent to the lake, near the site of the
enemy attack, right?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe. And the last shrine makes three.
These are the keystones supporting Neo Tengu Tower's barrier,
remember?"	
Message	Shido	You all remember?!	
Message	Yoshino	I-I do...! I... went with you, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	You too, Yoshino?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"My, my. What a charmer. Got everyone here wrapped around your\nfinger, huh?"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What? I didn't mean it like that...	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, enough of these games. Let's begin.
We don't have much time."	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's go!	
Message	Kotori	We'll need to split into groups then, huh?	
Message	Shido	What? I'm just doing what I can—	
Message	Kotori	FFT!	
Message	None	"(?! I-I see... She said we couldn't go in yet.
We'll need to do something about those keystones.)"	
Message	Kotori	"The monument near Tengu Tower. Hmm.
Yoshino and Yoshinon, could you two handle it?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes...! I'll try my best!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, you can count on me!"	
Message	Kotori	I'm relying on you, Yoshino and Yoshinon.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Roger!"	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san... I'll... see you later!	
Message	Shido	Be careful, all right?	
Message	Yoshino	Okay...! Um!	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's up?	
Message	Yoshino	I-I promise... I'll be successful!	
Message	Shido	All right! I'll be waiting for you!	
Message	Kotori	The outlet tower will be—	
Message	Origami	I'll go.	
Message	Shido	What?	
Message	Kotori	Origami Tobiichi?	
Message	Origami	"Not for you, for Shido. Besides, I have a history with the
location."	
Message	Kotori	Hmph. You're telling me you don't need your equipment?	
Message	Origami	"Not an issue. If the city is deserted there like it is here, I'll
be fine. Not that I expect any trouble."	
Message	Kotori	Noted. Then, show me what the Wizard of the AST is made of.	
Message	Origami	Shido, wait.	
Message	Shido	Will you be okay alone? Should someone else—	
Message	Origami	"Not an issue. Going alone is easier. If I'm with a Spirit, I might
slip."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Be careful!	
Message	Origami	"Kotori Itsuka. While I'm away from Shido, promise that'll keep him
safe. If you endanger him, I'm coming for you."	
Message	Kotori	No need to tell me that.	
Message	Origami	...	
Message	Kotori	The rest of you...	
Message	Kurumi	You're sending me away, aren't you?	
Message	Kotori	Why don't you go already?	
Message	Kurumi	"My, so difficult to please. Kihi... Kihihi...
Very well. That one. I'll eat her in an instant."	
Message	Kotori	...Sure you will.	
Message	Kurumi	"Hihi hihihihi... One day, I look forward to settling my score with
you."	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Kurumi?	
Message	Kurumi	Don't worry, Shido-san. I'll be back soon.	
Message	None	(I-I wasn't worried about that...)	
Message	Kurumi	Good day.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay, good luck!	
Message	Tohka	Kotori? Everyone's gone, so what next?	
Message	Kotori	"The enemy may attack Shido again. We're keeping Shido safe until
the keystones are destroyed."	
Message	Tohka	Got it!	
Message	Shido	Thanks, everyone!	
Message	Kotori	"No need to thank me. If you're grateful, then think of some ways
to persuade Ruler for me."	
Message	Shido	Ugh... Y-You're right.	
Message	Kotori	This isn't good. The destruction is spreading.	
Message	Shido	Ah... We either act now, or the world as we know it—	
Message	Tohka	Hey! Kotori! We have more immediate concerns!	
Message	Shido	Are those—?!	
Message	Kotori	"Yup, right on time! Tohka! You're on!
Camael!"	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! Leave it to me! Shido, don't leave my side!
Sandalphon!"	
Message	Yoshino	Aah! Y-Yoshinon! Huh?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Come on! Go time, Yoshino!"	
Message	Yoshino	G-Got it... Zadkiel...!	
Message	Kurumi	Fate calls once more...	
Message	Kurumi	Kihihi... Now, come forth.	
Message	???	...	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, you think you can take me?	
Message	Kurumi	Ahahahahahaha! Where are you aiming? I'm—	
Message	Kurumi	Over here!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... Fear not. The fun... has just begun!	
Message	Origami	It's starting. I must hurry.	
Message	Shido	Ah... There's another one!	
Message	Tohka	"Grr... There are too many enemies! Is it not time to penetrate the
barrier?"	
Message	Kotori	Tohka! Hold on just a bit longer!	
Message	Tohka	G-Got it! Shido!	
Message	Shido	Wha?!	
Message	Kotori	Get out of the way, Shido!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Kotori	*grunt*!	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	"I was expecting the worst, so I didn't want to kick it into high
gear, but... I guess I have no choice."	
Message	Kotori	Here I go... Megido!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aah! More are coming!"	
Message	Yoshino	I... I know...!	
Message	Yoshinon	"We can't stay on the defensive! We need to fulfill our promise to\nShido-kun!"	
Message	Yoshino	*grunt*!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yoshino, be brave! Let's do this!"	
Message	Yoshino	O...Okay! I'll do my best!	
Message	Yoshinon	"All right! There you go! Let's bring this monument down!"	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay...!	
Message	Yoshino	Zadkiel! G...GOOOOOOO!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ashes, we all fall down!"	
Message	Yoshino	*pant, pant*... *pant, pant*...	
Message	Yoshinon	"You did it, Yoshino! YAY! Good job!"	
Message	Yoshino	"I-It's all thanks to you... Yoshinon! Thank...
you!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Come on! This is all you, Yoshino! Shido-kun would sure be\nproud!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y...Yeah! I wonder Shido-san... is safe.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Don't worry. I bet everyone's doing fine."	
Message	Yoshino	Right! I agree!	
Message	???	...	
Message	Origami	Target locked... You've no idea what I have in store for you.	
Message	Origami	HAAA!	
Message	Origami	*grunt* Destroying each one is pointless.	
Message	Origami	As expected, they're multiplying...	
Message	Origami	The mission must be accomplished!	
Message	Origami	"I'm going to make this tower disappear.
Missile unit, all coordinates locked! Blastark!
All weapons, fire!"	
Message	Origami	Territory condensation. White Licorice, ignite!	
Message	Origami	Take it down, Blastark!	
Message	Origami	*pant* ...*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...	
Message	Origami	I-I did it? *grunt*...!	
Message	Origami	My limit? *pant, pant*... I can no longer use the Licorice.	
Message	Origami	Shido, be safe until I get there...
