Message	Shido	Zzz...	
Message	Kotori	...Shido.	
Message	Shido	M...mmm....	
Message	Kotori	Shido, wake up.	
Message	Shido	"Mmm. Huh... Kotori? What are you doing so
early in the morning...?"	
Message	Kotori	"I need to tell you something.
Let's talk before breakfast."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay... got it. Give me a second.	
Message	Shido	"So, what is it that you want to tell me? Is it
about the monument... or about the thing
that attacked us?"	
Message	Kotori	Not either, both.	
Message	Shido	Both?	
Message	Kotori	"When we got near the monument, that Angel-like
thing looked like it was trying to block us."	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	Kotori	Then it's natural to think it's a set.	
Message	Shido	"You have a point there...
So what was it? A... Spirit?"	
Message	Kotori	"We don't have enough materials to say for sure,
but for simplicity's sake, it's like a Spirit."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What do you mean?	
Message	Kotori	"Its qualities are extremely close to a Spirit.
But it doesn't necessarily have free will like
Tohka and the others."	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, even though your brain is smaller than
a Megaphragma mymaripenne, as a person, I
wish you could just picture it."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What kind of insect is that?	
Message	Kotori	"Whatever, forget it. I know for certain it’s a
being created from the Spirits' powers."	
Message	Kotori	"In video game terms, it's like a ""golem
or a ""Guardian"". That kind of thing."""	
Message	Shido	I see, but you still don't know the details.	
Message	Kotori	"Right. I couldn't get more than that. At the
very least, I know it has to do with the
barrier."	
Message	Shido	...Is there something you're curious about?	
Message	Kotori	"The waveform pattern of the Spirit waves from
the monument... matches the barrier covering
Tengu City."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Kotori	"The scales were so different that I almost
missed it, but after comparing them, they
matched."	
Message	Shido	Th-Then that means...	
Message	Kotori	"The barrier and the monument are closely
related. In conclusion, this ""Guardian"" must
be coming from the same place as well."	
Message	Kotori	"The obvious answer, is that the monument
must be the base of the barrier."	
Message	Shido	"Wait, the base is that monument?! So, if we
break it..."	
Message	Kotori	"If it worked that way, I would've done it
already. Unfortunately, it's not that easy."	
Message	Shido	Wait, are you saying... it's not the only one?	
Message	Kotori	"...Nice observation. Exactly. There has to be
something else in Tengu City that gives off
the same protection signature."	
Message	Shido	"So, we'll need to find that next, huh? We're
only getting started."	
Message	Kotori	"Yes. We've still got a long way to go.
However, Shido, it's our job to investigate
this. You need to prioritize your dates."	
Message	Shido	B-But at this rate—	
Message	Kotori	"If you notice anything, of course, then tell me.
But don't do anything more than that, got it?"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	Kotori	"If our analysis helps us determine where the
enemy's stronghold is, that'd be great, but..."	
Message	Shido	"The enemy? You mean that Guardian thing
from before?"	
Message	Kotori	"I'm talking about whoever made the barrier.
The one who's got us locked in. But enough talk!
Just focus on what you need to do!"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... Sorry. I'll cooperate as much as I
can. I'm sure it's tough for all of us."	
Message	Kotori	"In case it needs to be said, I'll say it: You're
not invincible, so don't overdo it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I promise.	
Message	Kotori	"Seriously. I'm so worried that I'll be
even more sleepless than Reine."	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Kotori	N-Nothing!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...?	
Message	Kotori	Is breakfast ready?	
Message	Shido	Sorry for the wait. Go ahead and dig in.	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido...san. G-Good morning.	
Message	Yoshinon	Yaha!	
Message	Shido	"Hello Yoshino and Yoshinon, good morning.
Breakfast is served, so get it while it's fresh."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay. Thank... you...	
Message	Kotori	Hey, where's Tohka?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, Tohka? She's headed for school already.
She said she doesn't need breakfast."	
Message	Kotori	Tohka... left without eating breakfast?!	
Message	Shido	"You seem surprised. I guess it's strange that
she wouldn't eat, huh?"	
Message	Kotori	Interesting...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?	
Message	Kotori	Nothing. Besides, you'll figure it out soon.	
Message	Shido	Really?
