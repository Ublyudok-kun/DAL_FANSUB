Message	Rinne	Alright, I'll be borrowing your kitchen then.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sorry for the trouble all the time.	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you promised not to say that, right?
Next door neighbors help each other out, after all."	
Message	Shido	"Of course. If there's ever anything I can help with
at your house Rinne, you can always ask me."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, Shido. But I don't think there's anything right now?	
Message	Shido	It's true, you do have it together, Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	...Is that so? I hope so...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's wrong?	
Message	Rinne	It's nothing. Alright then, I'll prepare things quickly.	
Message	Shido	Alright, I'll be watching the pot on my end. I'll leave that side to you.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Leave it to me.	
Message	Rinne	Today's meal is meat and potato stew.	
Message	Tohka	Ohhh! This is quite the delicious smell!	
Message	Shido	Everyone's here, right? Then, let's eat!	
Message	Tohka	Yes!  Let us eat!	
Message	Kotori	Yeah! Time to eat!	
Message	Yoshino	L...Let's eat!	
Message	Tohka	It's fluffy and delicious, Shido...!	
Message	Shido	You're right, this is definitely a motherly flavor.	
Message	Tohka	Motherly flavor?	
Message	Rinne	Umm...I guess you could say it means, a nostalgic sort of taste?	
Message	Shido	That's right. I wonder why, the taste is reassuring.	
Message	Tohka	"Hmm. I see...
Then I must aim for a motherly taste when I cook!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? You, cooking...?	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! I can do something like cooking too, Shido.
I make such things like cookies occasionally too..."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's right. Sorry.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, Tohka-chan, would you like seconds?	
Message	Tohka	Yes Rinne, please!	
Message	Rinne	"Hee hee, you're welcome.
Don't rush too much and spill it."	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Leave it to me!	
Message	Shido	Good grief...
