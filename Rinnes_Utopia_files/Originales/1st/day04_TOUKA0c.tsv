Message	None	"(She's eating politely, and she hasn't fought
with Origami since she started... Could it be that
I messed up the food, gluing her mouth together?)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, is something wrong?	
Message	Tohka	Hm? What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	W-Well... Did I mess up the bento somehow?	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? No, that isn't so. The spiciness of this
burdock root is perfect."	
Message	Shido	I see... As long as that's the case.	
Message	None	"(Hmmm... She didn't look like she was lying.
Oh, I gave some of my bento to Origami too,
so if I can see how she's doing...)"

its smell..."

Message	Origami	...!	
Message	Shido	"A-Are you all right?! Was my
bento not to your tastes?"	
Message	Origami	...There is no problem here.	
Message	Shido	I see... That's good, then...	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Something's a little different today.	
Message	Shido	R-Right? You think so too, right Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, girls are more complex than you think.
You have to pay attention to them more carefully.
That sort of thing is really important, you know?"	
Message	Shido	Er, ah, right... Wait, what do you mean?	
Message	Rinne	It's nothing. My goodness, Shido...	
Message	Shido	...?
