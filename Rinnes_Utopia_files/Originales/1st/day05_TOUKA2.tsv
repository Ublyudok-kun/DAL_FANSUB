Message	None	"(Hmmm, I thought I'd go on a date with Tohka,
but... If she went home early, then...)"	
Message	None	"(It can't be helped, so I guess I'll just buy
stuff for tonight's dinner and head home.)"	
Message	None	"(Hmmm, I still have a lot of time.
I guess I'll buy things for dinner
and then go on a date...)"	
Message	None	(Hm?)	
Message	Shido	Was that Tohka just now?	
Message	None	"(Isn't that an udon restaurant over there? I
don't usually go there, but it's pretty popular.)"	
Message	None	"(If that really was Tohka just now, it bothers
me... Should I go peek just to check...?)"	
Choice		Peek into the udon store.	
Choice		Do your shopping and hurry home.	
Message	Shido	Let's see, Tohka is... there!	
Message	Tohka	"Hmmmmm... To eat...? Or not to eat...?
I did refuse Shido's bento... Ohh..."	
Message	None	(Huh? T-Tohka...?)	
Message	Tohka	Hmmmmm...	
Message	Tohka	B-But then...	
Message	Tohka	Urgh...	
Message	Tohka	I did order it and everything, so just one bite...	
Message	None	(Tohka... What is she doing...?)	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, one bite... Just one bite!
I'm sure Shido would forgive me!"	
Message	Shido	Me? What is she talking about?	
Message	Tohka	Mm! Delicious! My chopsticks won't stop moving!	
Message	None	"(The mountain of tempura packed high into the bowl
disappeared in no time, as if being cleaved away
by an excavator.)"	
Message	Tohka	Mmm... That was amazing! Oh...?!	
Message	Tohka	N-Now I've done it... I ended up eating it all...	
Message	None	"(Haha... Tohka has an impressive appetite.
Oh, she's coming out of the restaurant.
I should call out to her.)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido?!	
Message	Shido	"Haha, you really were hungry, huh?
We could have eaten lunch together, you know."	
Message	Shido	"Haha, it looks like you were pretty hungry.
Even the staff was surprised by your appetite,
you know?"	
Message	Tohka	―?!	
Message	Shido	Hmm? What's wrong?	
Message	Tohka	A-Aaahhh... Urgh... *sniffle*...!	
Message	Shido	Huh? T-Tohka?	
Message	Shido	Ah! Tohka?! Wait a sec―	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Tohkaaaa!	
Message	Shido	"What on earth is going on?
Did I do something wrong again...?"	
Message	Shido	*Sigh...*	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'll do my shopping and hurry home.	
Message	Shido	"I'm glad I got a great deal on that meat for the
sukiyaki... I hope this'll cheer Tohka up
a little."	
Message	Shido	"All right! With all the good, cheap meat I bought,
I'll take care of tonight's dinner!"	
Message	None	(Oh, it's Kotori.)	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, what are you doing? Tohka's mental graph\nhas completely slumped!"	
Message	Shido	Err... Well that's...	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(D-Did I mess up again...? I've slipped up so
much, I can't begin to make a guess which mistake
caused this one...)"	
Message	Kotori	"You have some idea why, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	I kind of do... But I also kind of don't...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, that's helpful. I heard from Reine that
Tohka apparently left early to go home."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I was thinking about going on a date with
her, but that schedule ended up not working out..."	
Message	Kotori	"So, what exactly are you doing right now?"	
Message	Shido	Buying dinner. I thought I'd make sukiyaki today.	
Message	Kotori	"You idiot. If that was enough to improve her\nmood, she wouldn't have left early. This can't\njust be because she's hungry, right?"	
Message	Shido	B-But even so... I have no idea what else to do...	
Message	Shido	So, where is she right now?	
Message	Kotori	"She's back home and currently\nholed up in her room."	
Message	Shido	I-In her room...?	
Message	Kotori	"How long are you going to just stand there? Isn't\nthis what you live for? Going to help someone\nwho's in pain?"	
Message	Shido	R-Right! You're right!	
Message	Shido	R-Right... You're right!	
Message	Kotori	"Phew... Try not to screw it up."	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm sorry! But thanks to you, I feel like I've
woken up! Thanks, Kotori!"	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry... I shouldn't have just been shopping
while Tohka was in pain."	
Message	Shido	"I'd usually go running straight to her... Because
of you, I've woken up. Thanks, Kotori!"	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine, just get a move on and hurry home!"	
Message	None	Wait for me, Tohka!	
Message	None	Wait for me, Tohka...!	
Message	None	(Now then... Tohka's in her room...)	
Message	None	"(I'll stop thinking too hard about
how to patch things up.)"	
Message	None	"(All I can do now is face Tohka and my feelings
head on. That's all...)"	
Message	None	"(I may end up hurting her again... But we can't
move forward otherwise!)"	
Message	None	(All right! I'm going!)	
Message	None	"(There's no point in trying to think so hard
about things anymore.)"	
Message	None	"(All I can do right now is face Tohka head on
and try my best to save her. That's all...)"	
Message	None	"(I might end up hurting her again somehow...
But, we can't move forward otherwise!)"	
Message	None	(All right... I'm going!)	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka? It's me. Can I come in?	
Message	Tohka	―?!	
Message	Shido	I-I'm coming in...	
Message	None	(The door is locked...)	
Message	Tohka	L-Leave me alone...!	
Message	Shido	"I want to talk to you, Tohka.
Could you please open the door?"	
Message	Tohka	I...I don't want to see you right now!	
Message	Shido	"Why not?! If it's something I did, I'll apologize.
Just let me apologize properly, so―"	
Message	Tohka	Y-You didn't do anything, Shido! Shido, you...	
Message	Shido	Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	"I don't want you to...
hate me any more than this..."	
Message	Shido	Hate you...?! Me, hate you?	
Message	Tohka	"Th-This isn't... How it was supposed to be...
It wasn't how it..."	
Message	Shido	"H-Hey... What are you talking about?
I would never hate you, Tohka!"	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	Shido	"Tohka! Tomorrow, I'll invite you out again!
So... Please go out on a date with me,
one more time!"	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido... Okay.	
Message	Shido	It's a promise! I promise you, okay?
