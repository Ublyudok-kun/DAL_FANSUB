Message	None	"(When I glanced over at the lake, I saw Tohka
sadly staring across its surface, on top of the
short bridge leading to the outlet tower.)"	
Message	Tohka	......	
Message	None	"(Ah man... I bet she's still worried about what
happened at the theater... She looks pretty
down in the dumps...)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe it'd be better if I took her
mind off things...)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka? There you are.	
Message	Tohka	Sh-Shido...! Why...?	
Message	Shido	Why? I just wanted to talk to you.	
Message	Tohka	Oh, I see...	
Message	None	"(She seems pretty depressed... Maybe I could talk
about something to change her mood?)"	
Message	None	"(Or, maybe... at times like these, perhaps it's
best to not say anything unnecessary, and
stay beside her quietly?)"	
Message	None	(I wonder which one...)	
Choice		Try saying something.	
Choice		Be quiet and stay by her side.	
Message	None	"(I really should talk about something, anything.
Even if I can't think of the best topic, she might
cheer up just by having someone talk to her...)"	
Message	Shido	Umm... Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	"Er, well... I wanted to apologize.
Also... thanks."	
Message	Tohka	Wh-What for, all of a sudden?	
Message	Shido	"Well... I've been thinking that I wanted to
apologize to you at some point, but I also
thought that I wanted to thank you."	
Message	Tohka	...?	
Message	Shido	"When I was scared of the existence of Spirits
because of what happened with Kurumi, there was a
time when I... shook off your hand, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh... back then. I was not bothered by...	
Message	Shido	"No, no matter what reason I had, I can't forgive
myself for shaking off your hand like that."	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"So... I'm sorry... And then, when I was trying
to figure out what to do, you were the one to
reach your hand out to me."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm, did I...?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah... It's not like you and Yoshino appeared
and destroyed the world, or fought the AST
just because you wanted to, right?"	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...	
Message	Shido	"It was different with Kurumi. I don't know if it's
true now, but there was no mistake at the time:
She was attacking people of her own free will."	
Message	Tohka	...!	
Message	Shido	"With you and Yoshino, there was no question;
I knew you should be saved. But with Kurumi,
I didn't know whether it was right or not..."	
Message	Shido	"But... you taught me, Tohka. With your warmth, you
helped me to remember..."	
Message	Shido	So, thank you.	
Message	Tohka	―!	
Message	Tohka	"I-I see... Shido, thank you... You are trying
to cheer me up, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	"Er, well... I just said how I really feel,
that's all."	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, I know... That's what warmed my heart.
I thank you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Haha, getting thanked even though I thanked you,
that's kind of funny."	
Message	Tohka	I suppose that's true...	
Message	Shido	Ahahaha...!	
Message	Tohka	Hahaha...	
Message	None	"(Yeah, it was good that I talked to Tohka. To be
able to see her smile again, even a little.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Hmm?	
Message	Tohka	"I studied so hard... and learned so many things...
But why am I no good...?"	
Message	None	"(Oh, I see...Tohka was worried about studying
for the test...)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Tohka... There are different things that
people are suited for or not suited for."	
Message	Shido	"Rather than trying things that are too difficult,
I think it's good sometimes to focus on things
you can do well, and work towards those, you know?"	
Message	Tohka	"N-Not suitable...? D-Do you think
that too, Shido...?"	
Message	Shido	"Er, well... I just think you don't have to push
yourself so much."	
Message	Shido	"Of course everyone has something they can't do.
Sometimes it's necessary to accept that part of
you that's no good."	
Message	Shido	"Instead, you can improve what you're a natural at,
and... Huh?"	
Message	Tohka	*Sniffle*...*sniffle*...*sob*...!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka...?	
Message	Tohka	"E-Even then... I...*sob*...!
I-I wanted to try my hardest...
f-for you... for you...!"	
Message	Shido	Huh? Wait, what do you mean by...?!	
Message	Tohka	*Sniffle*...*sob*...!!!!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! Where are you going? Tohka!	
Message	None	(O-Oh man... Did I mess up again...?)	
Message	None	"(I'll keep quiet and stay by her side. Rather
than saying useless things to try to cheer her up,
maybe my feelings can be felt by being nearby.)"	
Message	None	"(I got closer to Tohka and leaned against the
railing of the bridge. The early summer wind blew
across the lake's surface.)"	
Message	None	"(Ah... Sometimes it's nice to not do much
of anything, and take it easy like this.)"	
Message	Tohka	Shido...	
Message	Tohka	"I studied so hard... and learned so many things...
But why am I no good...?"	
Message	None	"(Oh, I see...Tohka was worried about studying
for the test...)"
