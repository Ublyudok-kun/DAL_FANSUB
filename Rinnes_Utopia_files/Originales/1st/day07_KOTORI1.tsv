Message	Kotori	Bam!	
Message	Shido	GAAH!	
Message	Kotori	Hahaha. Wake up, Onii-chan. Ole, ole!	
Message	Shido	S-Stop it, Kotori!	
Message	Kotori	"Then, wake up already. Are you sleeping so
much because you've still got a virus?"	
Message	Shido	"N-No. It passed, so I'll get up. Would you
please get off me first?"	
Message	Kotori	"Then, wake up! Hahaha! Consider this a courtesy
from your adorable sister!"	
Message	Shido	Gah. S-Stop. I'll wake up! I'll wake up!	
Message	Shido	*pant, pant*... K-Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	What is it, dearest Onii-chan?	
Message	Shido	A-About yesterday...	
Message	Kotori	Yesterday? Oh, dinner was fantastic!	
Message	Shido	No, not that. Yesterday afternoon.	
Message	Kotori	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Are you still playing dumb? Hey.	
Message	Kotori	"All right. Now that you're up, it's time for me
to retreat."	
Message	Shido	Hey!	
Message	Kotori	Good-bye, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	Kotori. She's still... acting like that?	
Message	None	"(Not that it's a bad thing, but I can't talk to
her while she's like that. Unless I want
trouble.)"	
Message	Shido	Kotori, what's gotten into you?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Hm? What is it, Onii-chan?	
Message	None	"(...?! She's changed. Even with her white
ribbons, I guess deep down, she's still worried.)"	
Message	Shido	"Um, how do I put this? Don't you have to be
onboard the Fraxinus today?"	
Message	Kotori	It's totally fine. It'll function without me.	
Message	Shido	G-Got it.	
Message	Kotori	Anyways, where's lunch?	
Message	Shido	Oh. I'll prepare it now.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Onii-chan. What's up?	
Message	Shido	"Oh. I was wondering how the investigation for
the strange events was going."	
Message	Kotori	Strange events...?	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. Remember? All the stuff going on
with Tengu City?"	
Message	Kotori	Not a clue.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	That's better left to the adults.	
Message	Shido	But you have a responsibility...	
Message	Kotori	I said it's fine!	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Kotori. Stop dismissing me. Listen. I'm
serious."	
Message	Kotori	When am I not serious?	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	Thanks for the meal!	
Message	Shido	No problem.	
Message	None	(Kotori was like this all day.)	
Message	None	"(I mean, Kotori's always been lackadaisical,
but ever since she became Commander of the
Fraxinus, she was serious, or rather, strict.)"	
Message	None	"(But I know for certain something's off with
her. I can't let it go.)"	
Message	None	(The only way to fix this is to talk about it.)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Yes?	
Message	Shido	Want to go on a date?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter?	
Message	Kotori	Nothing!	
Message	Shido	Okay, then let's go on a date.	
Message	Kotori	I have plans today...	
Message	Shido	This late at night? What are they?	
Message	Kotori	L-Level up in my game.	
Message	Shido	Then you have free time.	
Message	Kotori	Hey, listen to me!	
Message	Shido	I am. You were going to grind, weren't you?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori, what's more important, me or gaming?	
Message	Kotori	W-Well...	
Message	Shido	"I want to go on a date with you, Kotori. Come
on. Let's go."	
Message	Kotori	Mm...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Don't pout. You must really not want to
go on a date with me."	
Message	Kotori	...No.	
Message	None	"(Ugh. Saying it to my face kind of hurts,
but I'm not going to give up!)"	
Message	Shido	Come on, Kotori. Let's hold hands.	
Message	Kotori	I refuse!	
Message	Shido	"I don't care what you think. I want to hold
your hand."	
Message	Kotori	*whimper*...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	What? Feeling shy?	
Message	Shido	No one's watching. It's fine.	
Message	Kotori	It's not that, you see.	
Message	Shido	Then, what is it?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Man...	
Message	Shido	"You've been acting weird since last night. All of
a sudden, you've got white ribbons and you
don't care about anything. This isn't like you."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Hey. Did I do something? If I did, let me
apologize so we can talk it out."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Kotori, are you listening?	
Message	Kotori	NO! I don't want to listen!	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Shido	"Understood. You don't have to listen to me,
you can stand there. I'll talk to myself, so
don't pay me any attention."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Hey. What am I to you?	
Message	Shido	"Annoying? Good for nothing? Or do you ever
depend on me at all?"	
Message	Shido	"If you do, I'm happy to hear it, but you don't,
do you? Haha..."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	To me, Kotori, you're amazing.	
Message	Kotori	...!	
Message	Shido	"Of course, you're my adorable sister, but our
connection doesn't end there."	
Message	Shido	You're responsible and trustworthy.	
Message	Shido	But I can't rely on you all the time, can I?	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	I've been putting a lot on your plate recently.	
Message	Shido	From now on, I want to return the favor.	
Message	Shido	"If something hurts you, I want to help you
get through it."	
Message	Shido	"If you want to cry, I'll cry with you. If you
want to run away, I'll run with you."	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan...	
Message	Shido	So Kotori, don't leave me, okay?	
Message	Shido	"You're still my sister, but there's another side
of you... that is special."	
Message	Kotori	Shi...do...	
Message	Shido	"It's restrictive, isn't it? Being siblings.
There's nothing we can do to change
that dynamic."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"Regardless, that's more of a reason to keep
each other close, don't you think?"	
Message	Kotori	...?!	
Message	Shido	Kotori, is there anyone who could replace me?	
Message	Kotori	Of course... there isn't.	
Message	Shido	"No one could ever replace you either,
Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	"It was never supposed to be this way. It wasn't...
It's all your fault, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Shido	Finally, you're being honest with me.	
Message	Kotori	It's all your fault, Shido.	
Message	Kotori	"I... I got my hopes up. I didn't consider my
position. I thought it was better that way."	
Message	Kotori	"Instead of being... siblings, I thought we could
be something else."	
Message	Shido	Kotori...	
Message	Kotori	"But that's not the case for you, is it Shido?
All I can be is your little sister."	
Message	Kotori	"Shido, you don't want our current relationship
to change, right? But as your little sister, I can
always be with you..."	
Message	Shido	That's why... you were acting this way.	
Message	Kotori	Yeah...	
Message	Kotori	"Well, there's that, but I really didn't know
what to do anymore."	
Message	Kotori	Me being strong...	
Message	None	"(I must have led her on, but in doing so I broke
down the wall Kotori fought desperately to hold
up. This was the end result.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Kotori. For giving you the wrong idea.	
Message	Kotori	Huh?	
Message	Shido	Um. Honestly, I see you as... my little sister.	
Message	Shido	My adorable little sister.	
Message	Kotori	Jeez. Don't say it to me twice.	
Message	Shido	But you are dear to me, Kotori.	
Message	Shido	"Even if you're not my blood sister, whatever
you do, even if you become a Spirit..."	
Message	Shido	I will never leave you. I won't deny you.	
Message	Kotori	That's a lie, because last night...	
Message	Shido	"Well, it took me by surprise. You did that stuff
out of the blue."	
Message	Kotori	"Because... I wanted to take the next step with
you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"I don't know if we can have the relationship
you want."	
Message	Kotori	Mm...	
Message	Shido	"But I'll always be by your side. That won't
ever change. No matter what relationship
we have. I promise."	
Message	Shido	"What others say doesn't matter. We decide
how things go for ourselves."	
Message	Shido	"So, Kotori, let's live together forever. The
two of us will figure it out, one day at a time."	
Message	Kotori	Okay.	
Message	Shido	All right. It's settled.	
Message	Kotori	Is that what you really want, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"If our relationship changes, it might hurt.
Who knows what the others think of us."	
Message	Kotori	"I couldn't bear the thought of you being
ashamed."	
Message	Shido	"I'm fine. It's kinda cool to say that and
have it be true. If someone were to say
something, I can't say it wouldn't affect me."	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	"But it happens, and we can fight it. We always
have and always will... That's who we are."	
Message	Shido	I'm ready to go to war. As long as it's for you.	
Message	Kotori	"I can fight for you too, Shido. You're the most
special person in the world to me."	
Message	Shido	"Me too. Kotori, you're so important to me.
In both your white and black forms. I love
you, Kotori."	
Message	Kotori	Shido!	
Message	Shido	Do you feel better now?	
Message	Kotori	...No.	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	Kotori	This isn't enough. More...	
Message	Shido	Man...	
Message	Shido	How's this?	
Message	Kotori	Tighter.	
Message	Kotori	I won't... let you go.	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	Shido	Oh...?	
Message	Kotori	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. Someone's calling. Reine...?	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, I turned my transmitter off. I wonder...
if something happened."	
Message	Shido	I don't know.	
Message	None	"(Something feels strange. Like a haze or unease
in the back of my mind. Is it a premonition?)"	
Message	Rinne	"Please, I want you to promise me. That you'll\nthink only of Kotori-chan. Otherwise, your\nheart will one day distance itself from her."	
Message	None	"(All of a sudden, what Rinne said came back to
me. Kotori and I were connecting here. This is
a moment to savor.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't want... this to change.
Kotori is irreplaceable, and I want to
prioritize my time with her now.)"	
Message	None	"(I could call Reine back. It might be serious,
but if I answer the phone, I'll miss out on this
precious moment.)"	
Message	None	"(I got a bad feeling. Where is this anxiety
coming from?)"	
Message	Kotori	Shido, are you sure?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah...	
Message	None	"(That's right. I already know what I'm going
to do. I'm going to...)"
