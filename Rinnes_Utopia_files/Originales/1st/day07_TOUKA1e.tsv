Message	None	(S-Sorry, Kotori! I can't pick up right now!)	
Message	None	(I promised that today, I would stay with Tohka.)	
Message	Shido	...All right!	
Message	Tohka	Hm. Did you not get a call from Kotori?	
Message	Shido	Ah, it's fine. I'm sure it's not important.	
Message	Tohka	I see. If that is so, then it's fine.	
Message	Shido	"More importantly, Tohka! P-Picking up where
we just left off..."	
Message	Tohka	Hmm...?	
Message	Shido	I-I also want to... stay with you always, Tohka.	
Message	Shido	"I-I'm not just talking about now! F-From
now on, too―!"	
Message	Tohka	...! I-I am, well... a big eater, you know?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah! I want to try eating different things
more with you, Tohka!"	
Message	Tohka	"There is still so much I don't know. I will
probably cause you a lot of trouble. Is that
okay?"	
Message	Shido	"Yes! From now on, let's go on even more
adventures!"	
Message	Tohka	"B-But still, I... I am not a regular human, no?
It is possible that I may lose control, even so..."	
Message	Shido	"Your powers have saved me a bunch of times,
right? Besides, whenever danger comes when
you lose control, I'll stop you. Every time."	
Message	Tohka	...!	
Message	Shido	"Painful times, sad times, happy times, fun times.
Everything that happens from here on, I want to
experience with you, Tohka."	
Message	Shido	"I want to keep walking together with you,
always—"	
Message	Tohka	Urf!	
Message	Shido	Augh!	
Message	Tohka	Ah, aah...	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Achoo!	
Message	Shido	Aaah! Jeez! See!	
Message	Tohka	Pfffff, hahahahaha!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Tohka!	
Message	Tohka	"Shido! I will always be by your side!
You and I, we'll be the same as the penguin...
Um..."	
Message	Shido	A couple of lovebirds, huh?	
Message	Tohka	Correct! We shall become a "couple of lovebirds"!	
Message	Shido	"...! Ah, yeah, you're right! If it's us, with you
Tohka, I'm sure..."	
Message	Tohka	Achoo!	
Message	Shido	"Aah, Tohka?! You're seriously gonna catch a cold
so let's head for the back. You'll get soaked
again!"	
Message	Tohka	Yes, you're right! Ahahahahaha!	
Message	None	"(Good grief. Though I was concerned for her,
happiness coursed through me as I uttered the
word "Now" with Tohka.)"	
Message	None	"(I never want to forget this feeling.
I swore it.)"	
Message	None	"(Surrounded by the people most important
to us, today, we step in a new direction.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, feeling okay?	
Message	Tohka	"Leave it to me, Shido. My skill with a blade is
still unmatched, you know?"	
Message	Shido	That's true. Haha.	
Message	Tohka	Yes! Ahahaha!	
Message	None	Marriage isn't the end of the road. This, I know.	
Message	None	"From now on, life awaits Tohka and me.
No doubt there'll be plenty of fun times,
but there will also be many hardships."	
Message	None	"I'm not sure if Tohka and I could ever become
a pair of lovebirds, like the penguins we saw,
but..."	
Message	Tohka	This is wonderful, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Everyone came, after all.	
Message	Tohka	I am so happy, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I can barely wait.	
Message	None	(This is the happiest day of my life.)	
Message	Tohka	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Tohka	I just wanted to say your name. Hehe.	
Message	Shido	I-I see... Um, Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	What is it, Shido?	
Message	Shido	I wanted to say yours, too. Haha.	
Message	Tohka	I see. Then... Shido?	
Message	None	"(Ah. At this rate, it might not end unless I
give up first. That's Tohka, ever so stubborn.)"	
Message	Tohka	...I love you!	
Message	Shido	Y...Yeah! I love you, too.	
Message	Tohka	Yes!	
Message	None	"(Goodness, Tohka's amazing. Always so
straightforward.)"	
Message	Shido	Tohka?	
Message	Tohka	Hm, what is it?	
Message	Shido	Promise me you'll be with me forever.	
Message	Tohka	"Yes, leave it to me! I am still inadequate, but
let us work on it together, yes?"	
Message	Shido	Sure, leave it to me!	
Message	Tohka	Hrm! Copying me again, are you?	
Message	Shido	Haha. Can I not?	
Message	Tohka	W-Well, it's not like you can't, but...	
Message	Shido	Hahahaha!	
Message	None	"I wonder who it was, who mentioned that
"marriage" isn't gazing at someone, but rather
facing in the same direction as them."	
Message	None	"From this day forth, there are things waiting for
me that I can't possibly imagine. With Tohka, I'm
sure they can be overcome. Nothing will stop us."	
Message	None	"We will both face the future together, walking
hand in hand."	
Message	Shido	"We'll always be together, Tohka. I promise.
Your heart is in my hand."	
Message	Tohka	"Yes! Shido, you and I will always be together!
Even if you tried to flee, I wouldn't let you!"
