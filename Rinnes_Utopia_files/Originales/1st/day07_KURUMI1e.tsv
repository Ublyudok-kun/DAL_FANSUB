right now.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know when Kurumi's going to
disappear. This moment is precious to me.)"	
Message	Shido	All right.	
Message	Kurumi	Are you absolutely certain?	
Message	Shido	Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	It's okay. No one's getting in our way.	
Message	Kurumi	Are you sure? You really chose me?	
Message	Shido	Yes. You're mine. It has to be you, Kurumi.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi feels so warm. Spirit, enemy...
Whatever category she once fell under
doesn't matter to me at all anymore.)"	
Message	None	"(Right now, I want to keep Kurumi safe.
She's fleeting. If no one else is on her side,
then I will be. I'll make her smile.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-san...	
Message	None	"(So, my relationship with Kurumi changed.
We became a couple, if only for a brief time.)"	
Message	None	"(Since Kurumi is a clone, I know she'll
disappear in the near future.)"	
Message	None	"(But... all ordinary couples face this problem.
People don't choose how they fall in love, nor
do they choose when love is taken from them.)"	
Message	None	"(In our limited time together, we've formed a
deep bond. One that will help us overcome any
pain.)"

be wrong about everything...)"

my fingers.)"	
Message	Shido	"Graduation day, huh? Never thought this day
would come."	
Message	None	"(When I was a freshman, girls were the last
thing on my mind. People started rumors that
Tonomachi and I were an item. It was rough.)"	
Message	None	"(Then I became a sophomore and met Kurumi.
She was a terrifying Spirit, but before I knew it,
she burrowed herself into my heart.)"	
Message	None	"(Since then, Kurumi and I spent loads of time
together. All of a sudden, we were seniors, and
it was time for graduation.)"	
Message	???	There you are, Shido-san.	
Message	Shido	Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	"Just as I thought. I mean, this is our special
place."	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	None	"(That's right. Kurumi hadn't disappeared yet.
Here she is, right beside me.)"	
Message	None	"(Back then, Kurumi thought if her body had
vanished, she would disappear too. But she's
still around.)"	
Message	None	"(Why Kurumi hadn't disappeared... I don't
know. I'm not sure anyone does.)"	
Message	None	"(Some mysteries remain, but I don't care.
The reason doesn't matter to me.)"	
Message	None	"(Was it a miracle? I'll take it. Kurumi's with
me now. That's all I need.)"	
Message	Kurumi	What were you doing?	
Message	Shido	Thinking about you, Kurumi.	
Message	Kurumi	Same as always then, isn't it?	
Message	Shido	You're talking as if I obsess over you.	
Message	Kurumi	Oh. Was I mistaken?	
Message	Shido	Well, not entirely.	
Message	Kurumi	Goodness. Hehehe...	
Message	Shido	Hahaha.	
Message	Kurumi	...	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san. I'm elated. More than you know.
But I'm also scared."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Hey, wait. Kurumi!	
Message	Kurumi	"Today, we bid our uniforms farewell, right?
I wanted to bask in this moment with you."	
Message	Shido	S-Seriously?!	
Message	Kurumi	Yes. Shido-san, you seem happy as well.	
Message	Shido	Well, er...	
Message	Kurumi	My happiness is for you and you alone.	
Message	Shido	Oh, well... Okay.	
Message	None	"(To tell you the truth, that was a lot to take
in, but I'm all the happier for it. Actually, it's
nice.)"	
Message	None	"(She may still disappear one day, but that
won't stop us from living our lives to the
fullest.)"	
Message	None	(I won't regret savoring it.)
