Message	Shido	Phew, that should do it.	
Message	None	"(Phew. I didn't expect to have after-school duties
today... No one's left in the classroom but me.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I still have to get ready for dinner, but I have
time. I'll drop by the market to pick up some food.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, Rinne said she's going to be
handling it. Then I have nothing else I can think of
doing. Hm... I guess I'll just go home and help Rinne.)"	
Message	None	"(Wait a minute... Now that Rinne and Maria are here,
not to mention tomorrow's meals, Rinne won't be able
to buy everything on her own, huh?)"	
Message	Kurumi	My, Shido-san, you're still here?	
Message	Shido	Kurumi...?! What are you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... Oh Shido. Why are you surprised? I'm your
classmate, it's only natural that we meet in the
classroom."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're right... Sorry.	
Message	Kurumi	"Not at all. Anyways, Shido-san, do you have any plans
after this?"	
Message	Shido	Well... I guess I don't until nighttime.	
Message	Kurumi	Then that's great. Would you come shopping with me?	
Message	Shido	...Just the two of us?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, just the two of us.	
Message	Shido	Uh...	
Message	None	"(I feel like if I just tag along, Kotori will be mad, but...
I guess we'll be fine now. And maybe Kurumi might
notice something like last time.)"	
Message	Shido	"...Got it. I'll go with you. But what are you going to
buy?"	
Message	Kurumi	Well, that is for you to see when we get there.	
Message	Shido	Why do I have a bad feeling about this...	
Message	Origami	Wait a minute.	
Message	Shido	Whoa?! Origami?!	
Message	Kurumi	My... Origami-san, you're still here?	
Message	Origami	So fake. You knew I was here.	
Message	Kurumi	Not at all. I am just a cute, ordinary girl.	
Message	Origami	...!	
Message	Origami	"Anyways, Shido. I can't allow you to go out alone with
Kurumi Tokisaki."	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's going on?	
Message	Origami	"There's a high chance that Kurumi Tokisaki will
approach you in a bold way. As your girlfriend, I have
a duty to protect you from this temptation."	
Message	Shido	Well, um―	
Message	Origami	"We can't say it won't happen for sure. She has proved
you wrong before."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. You sure seem to be putting up your guard
around me."	
Message	Origami	Of course. I won't allow you to be alone with Shido.	
Message	Kurumi	"Very well... Would you like to join us, Origami-san?
That way, we will be sufficiently chaperoned to your
satisfaction."	
Message	Origami	"...There's nothing to consider. Shido would want to
walk home alone with me."	
Message	Kurumi	Then Shido-san, please make your decision.	
Message	None	"(Hm... What do I do? Origami and Kurumi... I'm afraid
of what'll happen if I decide on one over the
other...)"	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... Well I did make plans with Kurumi first. So,
why don't the three of us go together? Are you okay
with that?"	
Message	Origami	Fine. Then I will protect you, Shido.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehehe... This will surely become a fun excursion.	
Message	None	(Um... Did I make the wrong decision?)	
Message	None	"(Kurumi had brought us to a general goods store. She
wanted to check something out here, but...)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san, look. Wouldn't you say this is quite
gorgeous?"	
Message	Shido	Let me see... Wait, is that a fruit knife?	
Message	Kurumi	"Yes. Other knives are a bit too big, so I was looking
for the right size."	
Message	Shido	"I see. Wow, the handle looks like a rose. I feel like
it really suits you, Kurumi."	
Message	Kurumi	Thank you, Shido-san. Then how about this?	
Message	Shido	"Looks like a black wing, huh? That seems to suit you
too, but... I would say I like the rose one better."	
Message	Kurumi	*Giggle*... Then I'll buy the first one, then.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sounds good. It looks elegant.	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my. Then I suppose it'll be a fine accessory to
walk around with at all times."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... Hey, wait! That's scary!	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe... I was only kidding. Oh Shido-san, your
reactions are so priceless."	
Message	Shido	Don't make fun of me...	
Message	Kurumi	I'll be careful. I'm going to go pay, okay?	
Message	Shido	Hm...? What are you looking at, Origami?	
Message	Origami	This is an item we need in our life together.	
Message	Shido	Is that a... sheet?	
Message	Origami	"Yes. A magic sheet that repels dirt. This is a
necessity in our future activities. If we put this on
your bed, Shido, your family won't catch us."	
Message	Shido	I wonder what you're planning on doing!	
Message	Origami	"...Shido, you're so bold. To ask a lady to say such a
thing."	
Message	Shido	Oh, come on! That's not what I meant!	
Message	Origami	"It's fine. Nothing about you bothers me, Shido. In
fact, I rather welcome that side of you."	
Message	Shido	"Hey! My bed is intended for one person! We won't be
sleeping together!"	
Message	Origami	...Shido, you're so shy.	
Message	Shido	Whatever, just don't put this in my house...	
Message	Origami	Unfortunate. Then I'll just buy one for myself.	
Message	Shido	...You're going to buy it?	
Message	Kurumi	Thanks to you, I was able to make a good purchase.	
Message	Origami	"I was able to buy something awesome thanks to you
too, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, what an honor to be of service. I didn't do
much, though. So where are we going next? I know
this isn't the end."	
Message	Kurumi	Hmm... Origami-san, why don't we battle?	
Message	Origami	"...Battle? Bring it on. No matter how many times we
go, I'll win."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, you sure seem confident. Then I look forward to
seeing the results."	
Message	Origami	Your confidence will be your downfall.	
Message	None	"(This is going the wrong direction... But they do seem
to be getting along to a certain extent.)"	
Message	Shido	So what kind of battle are you thinking about?	
Message	Origami	It's obvious what we're going to do.	
Message	Kurumi	"Well in a store like this, there's only one thing to do.
We're going to have a mini fashion show."	
Message	Origami	Shido, you'll be the judge.	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. I got it, but you guys are really starting to
act like Kaguya and Yuzuru..."	
Message	None	"(The two glared at one another and went into their
fitting rooms.)"	
Message	None	"(They both have a very unique fashion sense, but not
in a bad way. As long as I don't make any
inappropriate comments, I should be fine.)"	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	Kurumi	Shido-saaaan. I'm done changing.	
Message	Origami	I'm ready as well.	
Message	Shido	Uh, what am I supposed to do?	
Message	Kurumi	"I'll open the door now. Origami-san, you're ready,
right?"	
Message	Origami	Then together... One, two...	
Message	Shido	You guys... What are you wearing?!	
Message	None	"(I couldn't help but be shocked. From the narrow
openings between my fingers, I could see their
mesmerizing bodies.)"	
Message	Kurumi	My, is there something wrong?	
Message	Shido	Well, um... If I'm not mistaken... it's clearly...	
Message	Origami	No matter how you look at it, it's underwear.	
Message	Shido	Oh, wait a minute! You said fashion show earlier!	
Message	Kurumi	"Shido-san. Don't be prejudiced. Underwear is totally
part of fashion."	
Message	Shido	That's true, but...	
Message	None	"(I totally let my guard down. I never expected
lingerie...)"	
Message	Origami	"In order to be judged fairly, we chose the same
lingerie. Shido, which looks better?"	
Message	Kurumi	I won't allow you to say we both look good in it.	
Message	Origami	"It's also acceptable to say which of the two you want
to take off first."	
Message	None	"(No, that's beyond the point. I can't... get myself to
look at them.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehe. Shido-san, I know this isn't your first time, so
you don't have to be so shy. When I first transferred,
you chose lingerie for me, remember?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah but the circumstances were different...!
I mean, you two look too good... I really can't
choose."	
Message	Kurumi	My... *giggle*.	
Message	Origami	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's wrong?	
Message	Kurumi	"No, your words were so honest, I started to feel it
was dumb of me to be making a competition out of
this."	
Message	Origami	"Yes. What you said were words that came from the
heart. I honestly am happy to hear that."	
Message	Shido	"So I'm going to say this again. You guys both look
great. You guys are both attractive in your own ways,
and I can't put a number to that..."	
Message	Kurumi	"That's very much like you, Shido-san. I don't mind
that side of you. However, you're only going to shoot
yourself in the foot by prolonging your decision."	
Message	Origami	"Shido, I know you'll choose me in the end. So it's not
going to end like this."	
Message	Kurumi	"I believe you're just forcing your ideals onto him.
Maybe that's a form of dependency."	
Message	Origami	That's not true...!	
Message	Kurumi	"I hope so. In the end, it's up to you, Shido-san.
Right?"	
Message	Shido	"You guys... I'm happy to chat, but can we continue
after you change...? I don't like how people are
watching..."	
Message	None	"(Before we knew it, we were surrounded by girls.
I had the feeling they were all whispering about me.)"	
Message	Origami	Okay. Hold on.	
Message	Kurumi	Me, too.	
Message	None	"(In the end they both bought the lingerie they tried
on. We left the store around nightfall.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's pretty late. Why don't we go home? I need to
prepare for dinner."	
Message	Origami	"Got it. We'll end it here. Kurumi Tokisaki... We'll settle
this eventually."	
Message	Kurumi	Right. When the time comes, bring it on.	
Message	Shido	You guys are still going at it....	
Message	Origami	Next time, I'll be sure to win. Brace yourself.	
Message	Kurumi	"There is no such thing as certainty in battle.
Origami-san, you should be prepared to lose."	
Message	Origami	No need.	
Message	Shido	"How long are you two going to do this...? Anyways,
I'm that way."	
Message	Origami	Okay Shido, I'll see you later.	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, Shido-san. I will see you later, okay?	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	"(The two went their separate ways, and I realized
something.)"	
Message	Shido	What do they mean... later?	
Message	None	"(I pondered in peace until I got home, where I
discovered that Rinne had invited both Origami and
Kurumi.)"
