Message	Shido	It's morning...	
Message	None	"(I feel like I haven't slept much. Maybe it's because
I was deep in thought before I went to bed.)"	
Message	Shido	What should I do...?	
Message	None	"(I recalled the events of last night. Not only were
Rinne and Maria back. But Marina also existed in this
world. She should have completely disappeared...)"	
Message	Shido	And that girl... Rio. Rio Sonogami... did she claim to be?	
Message	None	"(The girl who called me Papa. Thinking back, she
seemed to act so similar. Like... the Ruler... and
Rinne, who used to rule over Eden.)"	
Message	Shido	"Maybe she knows something. I want to see her again
if it's possible, but..."	
Message	None	"(I have no idea where she is, so there's no way for
me to contact her. Marina seemed to know something,
but she can't access the Fraxinus from here.)"	
Message	Shido	Hmm, what should I do...?	
Message	Tohka	Wake up, Shido! It's time for breakfast!	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka? I'm already up, but... why are you in a rush?	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, hurry up and come downstairs! I can't wait any
longer!"	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. I'll be right down...	
Message	Shido	What's going on?	
Message	Kotori	Oh. Morning, Shido. Look at this.	
Message	Shido	Huh...? What happened...	
Message	None	"(Kotori pointed toward the table. There were various
dishes made of Western, Chinese, and Japanese food.
This was way too much for breakfast.)"	
Message	Shido	It... looks like there's enough for ten of us...	
Message	Rinne	"S-Sorry Shido... I was answering everyone's requests,
and it just kept getting larger and larger. I used the
leftovers from yesterday."	
Message	Maria	"I was helping her at first, but then it was getting
really fun... I wasn't careful."	
Message	Rinne	"It's fine. Maria-chan, you don't have to apologize.
You just helped me. I'm the one at fault..."	
Message	Shido	"Stop it, you two. I think I get the gist of it. So you
used everything from yesterday?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. There were also ingredients we were going to
use for today, and we thought it'd be a waste to
throw it all away."	
Message	Shido	"So I guess we had more than we thought... I'm
surprised."	
Message	None	"(I didn't think we had much left, yet they made all
this. I'm scared to ask how much we consumed
yesterday... I'm not even going to think about it.)"	
Message	Tohka	"I was surprised too! A full-course meal at the start
of the day is like a dream come true!"	
Message	Shido	...But we can't just eat all of this so easily.	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. I had a feeling this would happen, so I
already called for backup. I'm sure they'll be here
any minute now."	
Message	Shido	...Oh, Kotori, it's you.	
Message	Kotori	How rude. Did you forget your adorable sister's face?	
Message	Shido	"That's not what I'm saying. I mean, I knew you were
here, but you weren't your other version yesterday,
were you?"	
Message	Kotori	"Oh... Is that what you're talking about? Excuse me for
being the annoying one today."	
Message	Shido	"That's not what I said. Both of them are just two
sides of my cute little sister."	
Message	Kotori	Y-You always say that...	
Message	Kotori	Oh, seems like they're here.	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Shido-san. Good morning.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ya-hooo, Shido-kuuuun. We came to help."	
Message	Kaguya	"I have accepted your invite, dear Shido. Now, where
is the feast that shall satisfy my stomach?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Entering. Good morning, Shido. Thank you for inviting
us."	
Message	Miku	"Good morning～ Wow, to eat breakfast with darling
and all these adorable girls... That's so awesome!"	
Message	Shido	"Morning, everyone. It sure is livelier with all of you
here."	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... I know. Thank you, everyone. You're really
helping us a lot."	
Message	Maria	"I would like to thank you all as well. I guarantee that
you will be satisfied, so please help yourselves."	
Message	Shido	"All right. We don't have much time, so let's get to
eating."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! Thank you!	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha... Tohka-chan is so fast...	
Message	Tohka	"You listen to me... All-you-can-eat! That means we
can get more than seconds!"	
Message	Kotori	"Tohka. I thought your plate was just full. Maybe you
should chew more before you swallow."	
Message	Tohka	Hm? I am chewing, though.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, are you? Well, as long as you are...	
Message	Yoshino	Seriously... There's so much.	
Message	Yoshinon	"There's toast, rice, Chinese porridge. Wow, so much!"	
Message	Kaguya	Hehehe. Scrumptious. I say this dinner suits me.	
Message	Yuzuru	Correction. Dinners are evening meals.	
Message	Kaguya	*Grunt*?! I-I am not normal. I transcend time!	
Message	Miku	"I see. You're amazing, Kaguya-san! Then that means
you can probably eat more～"	
Message	Kaguya	...Excuse me? Miku, why do you say that?	
Message	Miku	"Because of what you said, Kaguya-san. If you're able
to transcend time, then that means you're able to
manipulate digestion time～"	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, um... Well... There are limits to the exact
amount."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Demonstration. Luckily, there are lots of dishes here
to test that theory. Miku, let's help her together."	
Message	Miku	"Okaaaay. *Giggle*... Kaguya-san, that kind of face
looks cute on you."	
Message	Kaguya	NOOOOOOO!	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, this is the one you made, right Maria-chan? It's
similar-tasting to Shido's. It tastes kind. I like it."	
Message	Maria	"Thank you, Rinne. Not only did I copy Shido, I also
wanted my personality to stand out, so I've been
practicing secretly."	
Message	Rinne	"You sure are a hard worker, Maria-chan. I never
thought about it like that. I just want everyone to
smile and say it's delicious."	
Message	Maria	Rinne, this is unfair.	
Message	Rinne	It's... unfair? Um... Why?	
Message	Maria	"I won't tell you why. Rinne, you should learn to
analyze yourself more."	
Message	Rinne	Um... Okay, got it.	
Message	Tohka	Shido, what's the matter? You aren't eating much.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I was just thinking about how lively it is.
Anyways, I'm going to dig in!"	
Message	Shido	I feel pain in my stomach...	
Message	None	"(Since Tohka was near me, every time my plate was
empty, she put new food on it for me. Before I knew
it, both my stomach and the plate were full.)"	
Message	Rinne	You don't have to eat it all, you know?	
Message	Shido	But I can't do that...	
Message	None	"(I refused any more food after that, but I did manage
to clear the plate in front of me.)"	
Message	Shido	"But I'm so surprised that we were able to finish
everything..."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, that was unexpected.	
Message	None	(Well, we can say Tohka ate most of it.)	
Message	None	"(During recess, Tohka and the girls gathered around
Maria's desk. They were talking about breakfast. We
ended up rushing and barely made it to homeroom.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Wow, I didn't realize so much happened this morning.
I would have liked to join in."	
Message	Maria	"I'm sorry for not inviting you. I figured it might be
difficult for you and Origami to come over so early in
the morning."	
Message	Kurumi	Don't worry about it. I don't blame you.	
Message	Origami	"Unfortunate. If you had called me, I would have been
over in a flash. Next time, I would like it if you invited
me."	
Message	Maria	"Okay, I will be sure to do so. Oh, come to think of it,
I don't know if I have your contact information,
Origami. Would you mind letting me know?"	
Message	Origami	Got it. I will send it to you later.	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? Send...? Tobiichi-san. How do you know Maria-
chan's number?"	
Message	Origami	Industry secret.	
Message	Rinne	"I-I see... I'm going to not think about it, okay?
Ahaha..."	
Message	None	"(Origami is her usual self. Her ability to gather
information is just amazing. I want to ask her one day
how she does it.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Man, it sure was intense. Both Rinne and Maria's
dishes were amazing. I couldn't stop eating."	
Message	Rinne	"We made a mistake, so thanks for helping us out.
But I'm glad you guys were happy."	
Message	Origami	"Well, Tohka Yatogami, you should practice more
self-control. You think a girl who eats a lot will be
liked by guys. Shido is secretly turned off by it."	
Message	Tohka	"Wh-What did you say, Origami Tobiichi?! Shido didn't
say that!"	
Message	Rinne	"That's right, Tobiichi-san. Shido would like it if
someone ate his cooking with a smile. Just like me.
Right?"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, I see! Right! Heh, that's right, Origami Tobiichi.	
Message	Origami	"You sure got me good... Rinne Sonogami, I shouldn't
let you be. An advantage that a childhood friend has
in living next door is detrimental to my approach."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my... Origami-san? You should repent for always
putting the others down."	
Message	Origami	You're one to talk.	
Message	Kurumi	Hehe... You sure have a mouth, don't you?	
Message	Maria	"Calm down, you two. Next time, why don't we do a
hotcake party? We can do it after school as an
afternoon snack."	
Message	Kurumi	"My, that sure sounds like a great idea. Right,
Origami-san?"	
Message	Origami	"I'm going to join, too. That kind of event should be
fair."	
Message	Kurumi	"I agree. I mean, Rinne-san and Maria-san, aside from
Kotori-san, you two are the closest to Shido-san."	
Message	None	"(I was smiling while watching them talk, and Kurumi
looked toward me. I looked away so our eyes wouldn't
meet.)"	
Message	Rinne	Yeah, but we can't help it... Right, Maria-chan?	
Message	Maria	Yes, there's no point in even pointing it out.	
Message	None	(Rinne and Maria were even looking at me.)	
Message	Tohka	All right, next time we'll do pancakes! I can't wait!	
Message	Maria	"Yes, I look forward to it as well. Let's do it sometime
next week."	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, I think the bell is about to ring. We need to get
back to our seats."	
Message	Origami	Roger.	
Message	Kurumi	We'll see you guys later.	
Message	None	"(Everyone is centered around Maria. I wonder how
much longer I can witness this. Thinking of it made my
heart ache.)"	
Message	Shido	*Yawn*... Today's classes are finally over.	
Message	Maria	Shido, you have a moment?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Maria? What is it?	
Message	Maria	"Rinne and I decided to drop by somewhere after
school. So when you get home, we won't be there."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you two together...? Got it. Have fun, okay?	
Message	Maria	Okay. I'm going to have Rinne teach me some things.	
Message	Shido	"Okay. Then I'm going to go walk around. You be
careful, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Okay. We can't be for sure. You be careful too, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Got it. Later.	
Message	None	(All right. I'll go kill some time.)
