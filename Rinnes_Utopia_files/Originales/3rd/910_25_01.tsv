Message	Mana	Oh, Onii-sama! What a freaking coincidence!	
Message	Shido	Oh, Mana. Doing well?	
Message	Mana	"Yes! I'm great. How about you, Onii-sama?
You're not hurt at all?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I'm fine. Things have been peaceful
lately, I think."	
Message	Mana	"Onii-sama. I take my eyes off you for one
second, and you immediately get yourself
into freaking trouble. Take care of yourself."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Thanks a bunch. Mana, you take care
too, okay?"	
Message	Mana	"Okay! Oh. Please don't tell Kotori-san that
we bumped into each other here."	
Message	Shido	Don't tell Kotori? Why not?	
Message	Mana	W-Well, don't mind me!	
Message	None	"(Even in this world, Mana and Kotori's
relationship is strained. I wonder why
she told me to avoid telling Kotori.)"	
Message	Mana	Onii-sama? The hell is wrong?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, uh... Nothing. Anyways Mana, do you
want to head to a café and catch up?"	
Message	Mana	"With you?! That'd be freaking awesome!
Please..."	
Message	Mana	 Oh. Actually, I had plans today.	
Message	Shido	Got it. I'll see you around.	
Message	Mana	"Okay! I look forward to our next meeting.
Good day, Onii-sama!"
