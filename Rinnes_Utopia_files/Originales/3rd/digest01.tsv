Message	None	"(Spring. It's April, and the new school year has
begun. Although I was an ordinary student, I,
Shido Itsuka, felt my life change drastically.)"	
Message	None	"""(I encountered an unknown phenomenon
known as ""spacequakes"". At the center of
it, I encountered an extremely gorgeous girl.)"""	
Message	???	...My name?	
Message	???	...I do not have such a thing.	
Message	None	"(Our first time meeting was, for lack of a
better word, intense. It was also the first
time I looked death in the eye.)"	
Message	None	"(That's when I realized that spacequakes
were caused by girls with supernatural
powers, called Spirits.)"	
Message	Kotori	Welcome. Welcome to Ratatoskr.	
Message	None	"(Ratatoskr was an organization that sought
to protect the Spirits. They briefed me on the
situation, and told me all about the dates...)"	
Message	???	"Shido, what do you want to call me?
Give me a name."	
Message	Shido	T-Tohka. What do you think...?	
Message	None	"(She had claimed not to have a name, so I
decided to call her Tohka. Thus, Tohka and
I began our typical, but odd, relationship.)"	
Message	None	"(That all became complicated when Origami Tobiichi,
a classmate of mine affiliated with the AST, or
the Anti-Spirit Troop, accidentally shot me.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka, enraged from seeing me get hurt,
tried to kill Origami. Somehow, I managed
to emerge unscathed and returned to Tohka.)"	
Message	Shido	U-um... I know! Tohka! Let's k-kiss...!	
Message	None	"(After kissing Tohka, her powers were sealed.
By kissing the Spirits, I could prevent the
spacequakes from happening.)"	
Message	Tohka	Will... you take me on another date soon...?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Anytime you want.	
Message	None	"(That's how my first interaction with a Spirit
went. Tohka and I took our first steps together
towards a future for both humans and Spirits.)"	
Message	None	"(After a while, the second Spirit appeared.
Her name was Yoshino.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Please... don't hurt... me...	
Message	Shido	Um... is this... yours?	
Message	None	"(She shivered like a lost puppy. When I handed
her puppet to her, something happened.)"	
Message	Yoshinon	Ya-haaa! Sorry, Onii-san. You saved me!	
Message	None	"(Instead of shaking from fear, the girl raised
her voice in jubilation, using ventriloquism
to make the puppet talk.)"	
Message	None	"(Its name was Yoshinon, a personality
through which Yoshino spoke when her
shyness stopped her from using her own voice.)"	
Message	None	"(Immediately after I met Yoshino, the AST
attacked, blasting Yoshinon away.)"	
Message	None	"(In order to help Yoshino, I looked for Yoshinon,
discovered Origami had taken possession of it.
I got it back, but the AST captured Yoshino.)"	
Message	Shido	"I made a vow. I promised her I'd be her hero.
I said I would save her, but I can't do this
alone!"	
Message	Shido	Tohka, please... Lend me your hand!	
Message	Tohka	"Haha. Ah, I see. That is right.
"	
Message	Tohka	"How could I forget?
The man who saved my life has called upon me."	
Message	None	"(When the AST attacked, Yoshino created a
huge blizzard. With Tohka's help, we were
able to charge in and save her.)"	
Message	Shido	As promised, I'm back to save you!	
Message	Yoshino	Wahh...	
Message	None	"(We risked our lives to break into the dome
in order to find Yoshino. She cried from relief,
and I did what needed to be done to save her.)"	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san. I'll trust you.	
Message	None	"(And so, I had successfully rescued two
Spirits.)"	
Message	None	"(However, it wasn't that easy. That was most
apparent when I met the third Spirit, Kurumi
Tokisaki.)"	
Message	Kurumi	I am Kurumi Tokisaki. I am a Spirit.	
Message	None	"(Her introduction was the most shocking, as
she transferred to my school. But she chose me
to give her a tour of the school and the city.)"	
Message	None	"(While on our date, I witnessed something
shocking. I saw Kurumi kill someone.)"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi, what did you...	
Message	Kurumi	"Isn't it better to kill than be killed?
If you point a gun at someone, then be
prepared to face the consequences."	
Message	None	"(I felt pure fear. A world-ending calamity.
Mankind's worst nightmare... The Spirit.
I understood what true fear was.)"	
Message	Mana	Are you safe, Onii-sama?	
Message	Shido	Huh...? Ma...na...?	
Message	None	"(As Kurumi prepared to attack me, a girl named
Mana Takamiya, one who called me her real
brother, came to my rescue.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Are you two siblings?	
Message	Mana	"Hmph. None of your damn business. Go kill
yourself, Nightmare."	
Message	None	"(It was a Nightmare, an undying Spirit who
terrorized various towns. Mana had come to
Tengu City to kill it, and attacked Kurumi too.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, please. Take a look at Kurumi one
more time. No more violence. Do not let
her heart dwindle any further..."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Tohka.	
Message	None	"(Seeing people die actually made me question
if I was doing the right thing, but Tohka's
encouragement motivated me to save Kurumi.)"	
Message	None	"(The next day, I vowed to Kurumi that I would
save her soul. However, Kurumi killed the version
of herself who believed me, and attacked me.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Fufu. Kikiki. Kikikikikiki! Now! I shall engrave
despair into you so that you never deceive me
again!"	
Message	Kotori	"I'm going to need you to give my powers back
to me for a little while, Shido."	
Message	None	"(When I thought it was over, my sister Kotori
appeared. She used her flame powers to make
Kurumi's clone retreat, but we didn't seal her.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori told me about the tragedy from five years
ago, how she became a Spirit, and my recovery
power was thanks to Kotori's Spirit powers.)"	
Message	None	"(However, the sacrifice was enormous. In order
to stop Kotori from possibly going berserk, I had
to go on a date with her.)"	
Message	None	"(Except there was one problem. Origami. Five
years ago, Spirits had killed Origami's parents.
And the Flame Spirit who appeared was Kotori.)"	
Message	Origami	"I've been looking for you all this time.
Waiting, searching for you."	
Message	Origami	"At last, I've found you. I've finally found you.
And I'm going to kill you. I swear it. With my
bare hands. Five years of waiting for this."	
Message	Shido	No, but... I can't believe she...	
Message	None	"(Origami had sworn revenge, and she watched
footage of Kotori and Kurumi fighting. She realized
that Kotori was the Flame Spirit and attacked her.)"	
Message	Shido	"No... You can't kill! If you do that, you'll
never come back! I-I can't see you that
way!"	
Message	Origami	"...I don't care. If I can kill Efreet with my
own hands...!"	
Message	None	"(With the help of Tohka and Yoshino, I helped
Kotori escape and decided to seal her powers.
Then, Origami's hate would be directed at me.)"	
Message	Shido	Kotori...! Do you love me?!	
Message	Kotori	"A-Argh... GOSH! Yes, I do! I do love you! I love
you so much, Onii-chan! I love you more than
anyone else in the world!"	
Message	None	"(And so I sealed Kotori's powers and faced
Origami once again. By telling her of my
feelings, I was able to convince her.)"	
Message	None	"(Kotori and I remembered our memories that had
been sealed for five years. The Phantom that had
turned Kotori into a Spirit. Those memories...)"	
Message	None	"(Then, that long summer, where I was taken
by the good, old days...)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, good morning. I was waiting for you...	
Message	None	"(I can see the new landmark in Tengu City, Neo
Tengu Tower. And Rinne Sonogami, my childhood
friend who supposedly grew up next to me.)"	
Message	Rinne	"If you need me Shido, then I will honor whatever
request you ask of me."	
Message	Rinne	"We will date. We will kiss, and be together.
We'll get married and grow old together, but
if you choose someone else, Shido, I don't mind."	
Message	Rinne	"Of course, you don't have to choose either.
If you'd rather date them all, I'll support you.
As long as you're happy. Whatever you desire."	
Message	Rinne	"I can be your childhood friend, partner, wife,
sister, mother, daughter, boss, subordinate,
enemy, stranger. I only want you to be happy."	
Message	None	"(Rinne always encouraged me. Always helping
me take steps forward. I didn't realize it
then... how Rinne's heart began to wither...)"	
Message	None	"(A world caught in a cycle, Eden. Ruler governed
over this world. But I didn't realize that Rinne
was Ruler all along.)"	
Message	None	"(While I spent my days with Tohka and the
others, something felt off. Tohka, Origami,
Yoshino, Kurumi, and Kotori...)"	
Message	None	"(But this world reached its limit eventually.
Rinne watched the cycle repeat itself, and soon,
Eden began to reveal its abnormalities.)"	
Message	None	(Finally, I was able to talk to Ruler directly.)	
Message	Ruler	"...? Is there a problem with such a thing?
People seek happiness. People dislike mistakes.
Even though I can grant all of this, you would deny it?"	
Message	Shido	"...If what I liked came true the way I wanted it, I'm sure it would be
great! But... an inhuman happiness given to me by an unknown entity...
even the small happiness of having earned it myself wouldn't reach!"	
Message	Shido	I―won't accept that this is paradise!	
Message	None	"(I denied the existence of this world.
Ruler's shock was enough to destabilize Eden.)"	
Message	Ruler	"...The end is approaching... Think carefully, one more time...
If even then, you will deny this world...
Then―come and kill me..."	
Message	None	"(When Ruler disappeared, I chased after her.
With everyone's help, I made it to Neo Tengu
Tower, the barrier's epicenter.)"	
Message	Kotori	All right, come at me!	
Message	Tohka	I won't let a single soul pass through me.	
Message	None	"(Tohka and the girls handled the Guardians,
and I ascended the tower alone. At the top of
the spiral staircase, there she stood.)"	
Message	Rinne	Haha. You've finally come, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Rinne?! Does that mean I was right?	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe. Figured it out? Everything is as you
thought, Shido. I am... Ruler."	
Message	None	"(The future I want doesn't exist, Rinne said.
Despite my best efforts, Rinne activated
Paradise Lost, Eden's true form.)"	
Message	None	"(I was once engulfed by its power, the dream
world. But I remembered my true purpose and
was able to escape from the dream.)"	
Message	Shido	"Let's go home together, Rinne. We're
going back to our normal lives. Starting
over from scratch. We don't need Eden!"	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry about failure. I'm here.
Everyone's here. You can find happiness
on your own!"	
Message	None	"(Rinne was taken by Eden's core and entered
sleep. Maybe it was my desperate cry that
separated Rinne from the core.)"	
Message	None	"(When Rinne lost control, Eden went berserk.
We returned to our daily lives. However, Rinne
asked for herself to be sealed...)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay. Got it! That's how we'll make it home.
You're coming too, right?"	
Message	Rinne	"Yes... I think... that is the only way we can
be together."	
Message	None	"(Our lips touched for a split second.
"	
Message	None	"But Rinne's body slowly disintegrated
into light particles.)"	
Message	Shido	Rinne... Your body, what's happening?	
Message	Rinne	"You see, I... I'm the only one who can't go
back with you."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean? But didn't you say―?	
Message	Rinne	"Our time together... The days we spent...
are precious to me."	
Message	Rinne	"It got me thinking. Maybe Eden was a lie,
but the days with you were all true.
True... happiness..."	
Message	Rinne	You see, this whole time, I...	
Message	Rinne	I loved you, Shido...	
Message	None	"(With those final cruel words, Rinne Sonogami...
vanished from this world.)"	
Message	None	"(And I was rescued from Neo Tengu Tower by
the Fraxinus, where Reine-san told me the
truth.)"	
Message	Reine	"Firstly, I will tell you that Ruler was an
existence similar yet different to a Spirit."	
Message	Shido	She wasn't... a Spirit?	
Message	None	"(Reine-san told me everything. Rinne was the
bodyless remains of a powerful Spirit, but once
sealed, she loses her vessel, and cannot exist.)"	
Message	Reine	"That's correct. Ruler, Rinne Sonogami, created this
world solely... in order to protect you."	
Message	None	"(Eden wasn't here to trap me. It was made
to protect me.)"	
Message	Shido	"I...I... knew... absolutely nothing...
And I... went and... to Rinne... I... I...!"	
Message	Reine	"Please, Shin. Rinne Sonogami simply tried to
save you. If you wish to repay her, then... please.
Instead of regret or apologies, give thanks."	
Message	Shido	Y...Yes.	
Message	None	"(Then, Reine-san handed me a small bag.
She told me she didn't know what was inside.
Even without looking, I had a feeling.)"	
Message	None	"(Reine-san understood, leaving to check on
Kotori to give me privacy. Eden was about to
disappear, so I wanted to take it in...)"	
Message	None	"(Upon opening the bag, I found a spare key
inside. Proof that Rinne was my childhood
friend.)"	
Message	Shido	"Didn't you promise you'd take care of it, Rinne?
Then, take responsibility. Take it with you!"	
Message	Shido	"Otherwise, I'll end up realizing how I won't have
you to wake me in the morning, or ask me how your
food tastes, that I'll no longer see your smile!"	
Message	Shido	"Why... Why?! You said... You said we'd be
childhood friends forever... that you wanted
to be together!"	
Message	Shido	RINNEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!	
Message	None	"(This fake world was disappearing, along with
the memories we made inside of it. The days
spent with Rinne. She wanted to save me.)"	
Message	None	"(The world turned white, everything rewound.
Back to before I met Rinne, leaving an incredible
power inside of me...)"
