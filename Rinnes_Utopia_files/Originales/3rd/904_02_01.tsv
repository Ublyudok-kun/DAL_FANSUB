Message	None	"(I was so happy... But I still couldn't believe it, so I
asked again. Then I regretted it a little, thinking that
it might have sounded rude.)"	
Message	None	"(I was able to be by Shido's side once again.
Honestly, that alone was a miracle. Because I should
have already disappeared, and have once before.)"	
Message	None	"(I couldn't give you happiness... But is it okay for
me to receive so much happiness from you...?)"	
Message	None	"(Observing Shido, I can tell, even without having any
powers. This Eden is coming to an end.)"	
Message	None	"(I think that Shido inviting me on a date means that
he's going to give the time he has left to me.)"	
Message	None	"(A date with me... not with Maria-chan, Marina-san,
or Rio-chan, but me. If you treat me so specially...
I'll get the wrong idea.)"	
Message	None	"(Even if it's an emotion planted in a fake world, I
was happy. It was really nice to be thought of by
Shido. So it won't hurt to enjoy today right?)"	
Message	None	"(And I'm going to tell him. This time, I'm not going
to say it and run. I want to hear his answer.)"	
Message	None	"(Hey, Shido? You're always so kind. And that's...
what I love about you.)"	
Message	None	"(This time, I want to tell him. Because I feel like that
would be the only thing I can give him.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh, you ready? Let's head out, then.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Sorry for making you wait.	
Message	Shido	"I didn't wait at all. Actually, I feel like you got ready
really quickly."	
Message	Rinne	I told you I'd be right back. I keep my word.	
Message	Shido	You're amazing as always, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"It's nothing out of the ordinary.
"	
Message	Rinne	Anyways, where are we going today?	
Message	Shido	I guess we can start off by shopping.	
Message	Rinne	"Hahaha. That's like what we usually do rather than
going on a date."	
Message	Shido	"Oh... You have a point. But I think even then, it's
fine. As long as it's the two of us."	
Message	Rinne	I see. If it's the two of us, huh... You may be right.	
Message	Shido	Here, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Um... What?	
Message	None	(I offered my hand, and Rinne stared intently at it.)	
Message	Shido	"I promised you, didn't I? I'm going to escort you
today."	
Message	Rinne	"...Okay!
"	
Message	Rinne	Then please do, Prince Charming.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on... What's up with the Prince Charming
thing... I'm not like that."	
Message	Rinne	"No. For me... And I'm sure for Tohka-chan and
Maria-chan, you're Prince Charming."	
Message	Shido	"Um... You're making me blush. Then what would you
be, Rinne? A princess?"	
Message	Rinne	"I don't want to be a princess. I want to be an
ordinary girl."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. That's so like you Rinne. But I think you can be
a princess for just today."	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... You're right. If you're a prince, Shido, that
works for me."	
Message	Shido	All right, let's go.	
Message	Rinne	Hehehe. Let's.	
Message	None	"(I can feel Rinne's warmth through my hand. I don't
want to let her go. I sincerely feel this way.)"	
Message	Shido	Okay. I promise you I'll make this date fun.	
Message	Rinne	Got it. I look forward to it.	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me!	
Message	None	"(Rinne and I held hands as we walked the usual path,
just the two of us. The time that should have
stopped felt like it was starting to move again.)"	
Message	Shido	...Hey Rinne. Aren't you buying too much?	
Message	Rinne	"You think so? I usually don't buy things for myself,
so... I guess I was starting to get carried away with
it."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come to think of it, we've never shopped like this
before, have we?"	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh. That's because you've never treated me like a
girl."	
Message	Shido	Oh... Well, I did see you as family.	
Message	Rinne	"That's makes me happy on its own, but... I wish you'd
understand a girl more."	
Message	Shido	Well, I think that's hard for men.	
Message	Rinne	"Really... I'd beg to differ if we're talking about the
Shido from the Tenou Festival."	
Message	Shido	"O-Oh... Well, about that... There was the whole Miku
thing, and I had no choice..."	
Message	Rinne	"I heard from Kotori-chan later that you went to
school without Miku-san's incident being related."	
Message	Shido	Well, that too, um...	
Message	Rinne	I want to see it someday... Shiori-chan, that is.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry. Please... Seriously, anything but that.	
Message	None	"(I feel I'm walking down a dangerous path as it is.
There is no way in hell I would show it to Rinne.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... Then you'd best study a girl's heart more.
You hear me?"	
Message	Shido	Okay, fine...	
Message	None	"(You can't escape an urgent problem without making
some sacrifices. It's to protect something important
of mine. That's what I told myself.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Well, Mr. Girl Expert. Please tell me your opinion of
this outfit."	
Message	Shido	"I think it's a cute blouse. That bright color looks
good on you, Rinne."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks. Then I'm going to buy this, too.	
Message	Shido	Okay... What, you're going to buy more?!	
Message	Rinne	I never said I was going to stop earlier.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah but... Keep it to a minimum, okay? If it's too
much, it'll be hard to walk."	
Message	Rinne	"Right. But that's a little unfortunate... I always
wanted to buy so much that I couldn't see in front
of myself. You know, like in a lot of mangas."	
Message	Shido	"Hey... Aren't those the ones where the guy's carrying
everything?! Please, not that..."	
Message	None	(Our date is going to be just shopping...)	
Message	Rinne	Okaaay. Well, let me pay and we'll go to the next shop.	
Message	Shido	Okay... Wait, you're still going to buy more?!	
Message	None	"(Despite my protests, Rinne answered with the biggest
smile.)"	
Message	Rinne	I think this is the first time I've bought so much.	
Message	Shido	"As long as you're satisfied, that's all that matters.
But you buy a lot more than Kotori. It was surprising."	
Message	Rinne	"Hahaha... Sorry, I couldn't help it. But if you're my
prince charming, you'll forgive me, right?"	
Message	Shido	What are you going to do if I say I won't forgive you?	
Message	Rinne	I'll do this.	
Message	Shido	What...	
Message	Rinne	Like this, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"O-Okay. But what's going on? You're not acting like
yourself today."	
Message	None	"(We were holding hands until we got to the shops,
but when Rinne initiated and took my hand, it felt so
different that I couldn't help but be thrown off.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Because you're trying your best. I figured I'd also
try a little, too."	
Message	Shido	Rinne, does that mean...	
Message	Rinne	Hey, look Shido! There's the crepe truck. Let's go!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey wait! Don't pull so hard!	
Message	Rinne	"Crepe is a date favorite, right? Let's eat it together,
Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Okay, okay, you don't have to rush. The crepes won't
go anywhere. You're not Tohka..."	
Message	Rinne	Ahahaha... Sorry. I wasn't trying to copy Tohka-chan.	
Message	Shido	"I know. Come on. We'll get there even if we walk
slowly."	
Message	Rinne	Okay, got it.	
Message	None	"(Rinne wasn't like her usual self. It seemed like she
wasn't holding back. Maybe that's what she meant
earlier. I couldn't tell.)"	
Message	None	"(But there's one thing I know. Rinne looks like she's
been having fun this whole time. And I know that's
happiness.)"	
Message	Rinne	"It's my first time eating it all... Crepes are
delicious."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come to think of it, we've never eaten crepes
together, have we?"	
Message	Rinne	But you've eaten it with so many other girls, huh?	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Rinne. Why do I sense a little bite when you
say it like that...? Anyway, I hope this makes up for it."	
Message	Rinne	Unfortunately, interest has been accruing.	
Message	Shido	Don't say it with a smile.	
Message	Rinne	But Shido, you're going to pay me back right?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'll pay you back double, triple.	
Message	Rinne	"Hahaha. Are you sure about that? I'm not going to let
you trick me like Tohka-chan."	
Message	Shido	"I won't trick you. And besides... There's so much I
want to give back to you. What I'm doing now isn't
enough."	
Message	Rinne	Hmm... I don't think you owe me that much though?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come on. I don't feel like I could ever pay you
back."	
Message	Rinne	"No, you already are though. Shido, you bring me so
much happiness."	
Message	None	"(Rinne was so honest with her feelings that I was
at a loss for words. Rinne says she's happy with our
ordinary life. That made me so happy.)"	
Message	Rinne	Oh, right. It's almost lunchtime. What should we eat?	
Message	Shido	"Is that something you should say right after eating
a crepe?!"	
Message	Rinne	"That's one thing, this is another. They say you have
a separate stomach for sweets, right?"	
Message	Shido	Well, I mean, I can eat but...	
Message	None	"(Rinne is really similar to Tohka today. She gets so
happy about food... overly happy...)"	
Message	Rinne	"You can feel so happy just by eating something
delicious."	
Message	Shido	"It's true. Eating delicious food kinda feels...
fulfilling."	
Message	Rinne	I know, right? So, let's go on a food journey!	
Message	Shido	I feel like you're totally losing sight of our goal.	
Message	Rinne	Who cares. Will you come with me?	
Message	Shido	Of course. I'll follow you wherever you go, Princess.	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha. Sorry for being such a spoiled princess.	
Message	Shido	"Don't worry about it. The Prince always has a soft
spot for the princess."	
Message	Rinne	Thank you, Shido.	
Message	Rinne	"But if I really were a princess... Then I'd be the
little mermaid."	
Message	None	"(I heard Rinne mutter those words, and I gripped her
hand more tightly.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, this Neapolitan is so good... The ketchup doesn't
seem store-bought. I wonder if they made it in-
house?"	
Message	Shido	"This pepperoncino is delicious, too. It's very flavorful,
but not too overpowering."	
Message	Rinne	"Hey Shido? Is it okay to eat really strong flavors
like this on a date?"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... W-Well, it looked so delicious, I couldn't help
it."	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh... It's fine because you're with me, but you
can't do that with other girls."	
Message	Shido	Sorry... So you want a bite, Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	N-No, thanks.	
Message	Shido	"Oh come on. It smells so good, doesn't it? It'll be a
missed opportunity if you don't eat this."	
Message	Rinne	You're trying to drag me down, aren't you?	
Message	Shido	Caught me.	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh, it's so obvious. Hmm I guess... I'll take one
bite. Why don't we feed each other?"	
Message	Shido	F-Feed one another?!	
Message	Rinne	"I mean you seemed to want to try mine. And today...
we're on a date, right? Come on. Open wide."	
Message	Shido	O-Okay. Ahhh... *nom*.	
Message	Shido	" Delicious!
You can't replicate this with store-bought ketchup!
It's so easy to eat."	
Message	Rinne	"Right? But I guess it's more for girls. Anyways, your
turn, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Open wide.	
Message	Rinne	Ahhh... *nom*.	
Message	Rinne	" Oh, this is delicious too.
But I don't think I could eat too much of it."	
Message	Shido	"I guess this flavoring is more for guys huh? It tastes
good, but I don't think I could serve this at home.
How unfortunate."	
Message	Rinne	"Well, your place has mostly female inhabitants. And
the visitors are mostly girls, too."	
Message	Shido	I know...	
Message	Rinne	"But Tohka-chan likes those kinds of dishes, so it
may be a good idea to make it next time."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. I'll give it a shot... Sorry, we're on a
date, and we're talking about the food we eat at my
house."	
Message	Rinne	"No. I'm just happy to see you look like you're having
fun."	
Message	None	"(I got a little self-conscious, so I looked away from
Rinne and focused on the pepperoncino. Oh... And I
also have to deal with my breath, too.)"	
Message	Rinne	Wow... This plushie is so cute.	
Message	None	"(I looked at the plushie Rinne said was cute. It was
a Tengu-like mascot with two cow horns and black
wings. I guess the motif was the Karasu Tengu.)"	
Message	Shido	Is that... cute?	
Message	Rinne	"It looks a little dinky, but don't you think that's
its charm?"	
Message	Shido	Come to think of it, I guess...	
Message	None	"""(More than that, what is up with this name, ""Tengu
Cow-kun""... It's totally a gag name. Hm... but it
sounds familiar...?)"""	
Message	Rinne	I... have never seen this character before.	
Message	Shido	Me, neither. Maybe it's a mascot for Tengu City.	
Message	Rinne	Um... I guess we can buy it?	
Message	Shido	"How much is it... Wait, it's the size of my palm, but
it's 3,000 yen?!"	
Message	Rinne	That's a bit much...	
Message	Shido	It is...	
Message	Rinne	Then I'm going to buy one thing that I was eyeing.	
Message	Shido	What? You're going to buy it?!	
Message	Rinne	"Nooo. The thing over there. It's a flower accessory.
I thought it was cute."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. It is cute. Then I'll wait for you at the
entrance."	
Message	Rinne	Okay. I'll head over as soon as I pay for this, okay?	
Message	Shido	You don't have to hurry.	
Message	Rinne	"Well the sun's setting, so I don't want to spend too
much time. And besides, I know which one I want to
buy."	
Message	Shido	Okay. I'll be waiting there, okay?	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Thanks, Shido.	
Message	None	"(The sun started to set, and the sky turned orange.
Rinne and I had come to Takadai.)"	
Message	Shido	Why did you want to come here?	
Message	Rinne	"I think it's because this place has so many memories.
Maybe I just wanted to see the city where I was able
to spend time with you."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Rinne	"We looked over it together last time, remember?
The view from this place."	
Message	Shido	...You're right. I remember.	
Message	Rinne	"I decided that I was going to forget everything and
just enjoy myself today. Not worrying about doing
anything that might make you hate me... All of it."	
Message	Rinne	"And I had so much fun. You were surprised, weren't
you? I wasn't acting like the usual me."	
Message	Shido	"Um... Yeah. I guess I wasn't so much surprised as I
was happy."	
Message	Rinne	Happy?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I mean, I remember you were the Ruler. That
you're not just a good girl."	
Message	Rinne	"...Hehe. Hahah. You're right. You're totally right.
You know that I'm annoying, with a lot of baggage,
and I'm always meddling, too."	
Message	Shido	Don't say that about yourself.	
Message	Rinne	"But you shouldn't be talking, Shido. You're annoying,
with a lot of baggage, and you're always meddling."	
Message	Shido	...Well, I won't deny that.	
Message	None	"(I mean I know it. I also think it's a flaw of mine.
But I can't just stand there when people are hurt.)"	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido... Have you found your answer yet?	
Message	Shido	Well...	
Message	None	"(I haven't found it yet. It's unrelenting, and I'm
continuing to stress about it.)"	
Message	None	"(I decided to take care of unfinished business so that
I could make a decision today. That's what my date
with Rinne was for.)"	
Message	None	"(Before, Rinne and I didn't have the capacity to think
about other things, or do the things we did today.)"	
Message	None	"(The only time I was able to go on a date with her
was in a dream. But I denied Rinne under this same
sunset. I denied the happy world from that dream.)"	
Message	Rinne	"I decided. I'm going to have the resolve to keep on
going."	
Message	Shido	The resolve?	
Message	Rinne	You told me before, Shido. Let's go home together.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I did. But you...	
Message	None	"(I couldn't finish the sentence. Rinne couldn't come
home. She was alone. Disappeared, leaving me behind.)"	
Message	Rinne	Don't look so sad, Shido. You're making me sad.	
Message	Shido	"But aren't you going to say it again? That you can't
come home with me. That you can't stay with me!"	
Message	None	"(The things that were going through my head were
slipping out of my mouth. The emotions that I
repressed were overflowing.)"	
Message	Shido	"I don't want it! I remember now! That you existed.
That you left me. That... you protected me!"	
Message	Rinne	...Shido.	
Message	None	"(Once I let it out, I couldn't stop. But my mind was
surprisingly calm.)"	
Message	None	"(I realized it was so simple. I was scared. I was
scared that the person I knew would disappear once
again.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, you're too kind. That's why you carry it all by
yourself."	
Message	Shido	...Here we go again.	
Message	Rinne	Again?	
Message	Shido	"Both Maria and Marina said that to me. That... I'm too
nice."	
Message	Rinne	I see... Those two must be watching you closely, then.	
Message	Shido	"No... It's not that... I'm not nice. I... I just want
to be with you guys!"	
Message	Rinne	There's something I want you to remember, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Something... you want me to remember?	
Message	Rinne	"I love you, Shido. No matter what happens, I know
my feelings won't change."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	"But I also love everyone else. Not in a romantic way,
but the feeling isn't any different from love."	
Message	Rinne	"I love Tohka-chan who eats so happily. I love
Tobiichi-san who says weird things out of the blue.
I love Yoshino-chan who helps from time to time."	
Message	Rinne	"I love Kotori-chan who calls me One-chan. I love
Tokisaki-san who supports everyone. I love Kaguya-
chan who exaggerates when she's surprised."	
Message	Rinne	"I love Yuzuru-chan who always coolly speaks her
mind. I love Miku-san who is always working so hard.
I love Maria-chan since she's so similar to me."	
Message	Rinne	"I love everyone I've met in this world. This feeling
is undoubtedly my treasure."	
Message	Rinne	"You're here. Everyone's here... I feel so satisfied.
So I have to give back. Everyone's true futures."	
Message	Shido	But... That means―!	
Message	None	(Rinne, Maria, Marina, and Rio will disappear.)	
Message	Shido	"Are you going to say the same thing as Marina...?!
Why won't anyone say it?! That they want to be with
me! That they want to be with all of us!"	
Message	Rinne	"We're all similar. We're all annoying, with our own
burdens and our meddling. We can't stand anyone
continuing to be hurt."	
Message	Rinne	"Even if Eden worked out and we continued our daily
lives, an end will eventually come, just like last
time. I think you're the one who will regret it then."	
Message	Rinne	"So, no one wants you to stop moving. We want you to
keep on going, with our love supporting you from
behind."	
Message	Shido	"What... That's not fair... You're going to leave it all
to me and just disappear..."	
Message	Rinne	But you're Prince Charming, right Shido?	
Message	Shido	Haha... That makes no sense.	
Message	Rinne	I'm... a little mermaid.	
Message	None	"(Rinne was smiling, but tears welled up in her eyes.
The sunset shone on her face... She was gorgeous.)"	
Message	Rinne	"But I'm going to tell you. This time, I'm going to say
it."	
Message	Shido	Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"I'll always, always love you. Even if you forget me,
I'll always love you."	
Message	Rinne	"So... So, please... If you can, I want you to leave me
a little space in your heart, Shido. Even if it's only
a little. Please?"	
Message	Shido	But if I get out of here... I'll forget you again...!	
Message	Rinne	"It's still okay. Just remember me until the final
moment."	
Message	Shido	"I won't forget. I'll never forget. Even if I get out of
here, I promise I'll remember you."	
Message	Rinne	"...Thank you, Shido. That makes me so happy... to
hear that."	
Message	Rinne	"""I knew it was that. The ""most important thing"" that
Rio-chan mentioned."""	
Message	None	"(It wasn't somewhere in the town. Because I had it
the whole time. From the day Rinne disappeared, I
had it the whole time―)"	
Message	None	(I've made up my mind―)	
Choice		I don't need this anymore.	
Choice		I thought about Rio.
