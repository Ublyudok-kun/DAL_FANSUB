Message	Shido	"Okay, so I have my house keys, wallet... all here.
What's left... my handkerchief... Wait, I already put
that in, huh?"	
Message	None	"(Ten years had passed since then. I graduated college,
and with Kotori and the others' support, I opened a
small café.)"	
Message	None	"(The café is doing all right... Or rather, thanks to
my regulars who come to eat dinner almost every day,
I can say it's doing pretty well.)"	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Papa! Can we not leave yet?	
Message	Shido	"Sorry! Give me a little more time! So what's left?
Oh, camera... Got it! I'm on my way!"	
Message	None	"(The staff in the café were myself―the manager―
and two others. Maria who followed the same path,
and my wife Rinne.)"	
Message	None	In my life... I think I'm the happiest.	
Message	None	"(Rinne and I got married before we opened the café.
Of course I proposed. The things that happened there
were all a distant memory.)"	
Message	None	Let's be together forever.	
Message	None	"(We didn't need a big wedding, but others got involved
and it ended up being pretty big. It was very
uncomfortable when they told us to have kids quickly.)"	
Message	???	...! ...!	
Message	None	(But then we had a daughter and―)	
Message	Shido	"Sorry it took me so long to get ready. You can eat
whatever you want for lunch."	
Message	Rio	Really?! Is that more delicious than your food, Papa?	
Message	Shido	Uh... Well I can't say so in general, but...	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Rio! Of course Papa's food is the best.	
Message	Rio	"Yeah! Papa's food is the most delicious! But Mama,
your food is just as good too! All the pigs and
bunnies said so!"	
Message	Rinne	"Hahaha... Thank you. Come, Papa is here, so let's get
going."	
Message	Rio	"YAYYY! Let's go! We're going out ♪ Going out ♪
Gooooing ouuut with Papaaa and Mamaaa ♪"	
Message	Rinne	"Hey, Rio. If you pull too hard, it's hard for us to
walk. It's been a while since we all went out like
this, so let's take it slow. Right, Papa?"	
Message	Shido	"Hm...? Yeah, right. Let's take a stroll to the
station."	
Message	Rio	"Okaaay. Waaalk slowly ♪ Taking a stroll with Papa
and Mamaaaa ♪"	
Message	Shido	Haha.... You really like to sing, don't you Rio?	
Message	Rio	"Yeah, I love it! The singing teacher said I can visit
her anytime. She said she'll teach me～ So I'm going
to go and get even better!"	
Message	Shido	"Rio... Let's wait for that until you're a little older,
okay?"	
Message	Rio	"Why? Rio wants to become better! Or is the other
teacher better? She was saying DNA-wise, blah-
blah-blah."	
Message	Rinne	"Rio... That too, let's wait till you're a bit older.
For your future."	
Message	Rio	Aww, boring. Then teach me, Mama?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, that's like a good idea. She used to be called
Raizen's Lorelei. She had a duet with a professional
and is called the Legend of the Tenou Festival."	
Message	Rio	Whoa. Mama, you're a legend? Is that amazing?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that means she's incredible.	
Message	Rio	"Wow, Mama! Then starting today you will be my
mentor! You're earth-shatteringly amazing!"	
Message	Rinne	Gosh... Where do you learn those phrases from?	
Message	Rio	Miss Darkness and Miss Darkness' older sister!	
Message	Shido	Gosh, our regulars don't teach you anything good!	
Message	Rio	You think so? The regulars are all fun though!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that's true, but still.	
Message	Rinne	"There are troubling times. Like those two. They always
come right after we close shop."	
Message	Shido	"Well, not only do they come during that time, they
drink too, so it got to the point where we opened
up for Bar Time, too."	
Message	Rio	"But Kotori-chan and Kurumin said they were busy a
lot. "Yet we find the time to come, so you best be
thankful," is what they said."	
Message	Shido	"Listen to me, Rio. You never force appreciation onto
people. You remember that, okay? And you're still
small so try not to wait up for them."	
Message	Rinne	"You say that, but you're the one that takes her...
You're too easy on Rio."	
Message	Rio	Hehe. Papa loooooves Rio! So Rio loves Papa, too!	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's right. Papa loves you, Rio. And of course
Mama, too."	
Message	Rinne	I love you both, too.	
Message	Rio	"Yeah! I love you too, Mama! Papa, Mama, you two will
allllways be with Rio! "	
Message	Shido	Yeah, always together.	
Message	Rinne	Right. Always together.	
Message	None	"(There's so much laughter right in front of me. I can
say for a fact to myself back then that I wasn't
wrong.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Rio? How do you feel when you get to go out
with the papa and mama you love so much?"	
Message	Rio	"Um.... My heart feels very warm and fuzzy. I feel
happy and it's fun!"	
Message	None	"(These days are going to continue, tomorrow and the
next day, and the day after that. Over and over, for
infinity.)"	
Message	Rio	―I'm so happy!	
Message	None	(But here... Happiness was all but assured.)
