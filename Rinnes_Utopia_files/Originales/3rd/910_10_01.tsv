Message	Shido	Hey, you just sighed at me. That's so rude.

HEY!"	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's with you all of a sudden?	
Message	Tonomachi	"All of a sudden? This isn't all of a sudden.
It's ALWAYS. Always, always. Every single
day, Itsuka, I think, "Screw you...""	
Message	Shido	That isn't polite. Why's that?	
Message	Tonomachi	Yeah, it's so polite that it's impolite!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Rinne-chan, and Maria-chan, who you live with.
Your friends, Tohka-chan and Tobiichi. Kaguya-
chan, Yuzuru-chan, Tokisaki-san, and Miku-tan."	
Message	Shido	Uh. What's up with you?	
Message	Tonomachi	"WHY...? WHY?! Just a while ago, you were just
like me! Totally and hopelessly unpopular!"	
Message	Shido	Uh, okay...	
Message	Tonomachi	"Damn it...! DAMN YOU! Itsuka, you told me we're
friends. That we'd become men together!"

Message	Tonomachi	WAAAAAAH! I'm suing you!	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait?!
