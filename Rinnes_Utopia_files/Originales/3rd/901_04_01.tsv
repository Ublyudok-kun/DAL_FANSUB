Message	None	"(I had some free time, so I went to my room. Rinne
and Maria had just finished preparing dinner.)"	
Message	None	"(It's the first time I'd been in my room since I left
this morning. Before that phenomenon happened,
I would have been in my room.)"	
Message	Shido	...I knew it.	
Message	None	"(I was thinking about that moment from this morning
as I opened my desk drawer. There was a small bag
inside.)"	
Message	None	"(This was a key that Kotori gave me, saying I could
give it to someone... or it should have been.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I guess that's what it was for. Or else this
place wouldn't exist. But...)"	
Message	None	"(I remembered. That this world was recreated. I met
Maria. And seeing Rinne, I remembered...)"	
Message	None	"(This key was what Rinne had forgotten. The one thing
that I gave Rinne. Proof of us being family.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if Rinne remembers our last conversation.
We decided that we're going to start over together.
But then Rinne disappeared, along with Eden.)"	
Message	None	"(Is this something I need to give Rinne once more?
But this may be something incredibly cruel.)"	
Message	Shido	...What do I want to do?	
Message	None	"(I don't think it's okay to remain in this world. But at
the same time, there's a part of me that cherishes
my days with Rinne and Maria. So I...)"	
Message	Kotori	Hey, Onii-chan! Everyone's ready!	
Message	Shido	...Okay, sorry. I'll be over right away!	
Message	None	(I shut my drawer and headed to the living room.)	
Message	Miku	"Yoshino-chan, you're as cute as always～
What day of the week are you the cutest?"	
Message	Yoshino	"U-Uh... I don't know. Y-Yuzuru-san... how should I
answer...?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Instruction. Master Origami said so, too. There is no
moment where you are not cute. A woman will always
become cute for the person they love."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Whoa, Origami-chan is so cool! Yoshino, you should\nbe upfront, too!"	
Message	Yoshino	Wh-What... What should I do...	
Message	Kaguya	"I see... So this is the great black shield that shall
bring forth the ultimate heat. Soon the offerings will
be sacrificed..."	
Message	Maria	"Then why don't we try putting Kaguya onto the teppan
plate? Origami, please tie up Kaguya."	
Message	Origami	Leave it to me.	
Message	Kaguya	"W-Wait a minute! I never said that I'd be the
offering!"	
Message	Maria	"If that's the case, please go over there and hang out
with the others. I can't pour the oil on the plate."	
Message	Kaguya	"G-Got it! Hehehe... I shall silently wait for tonight's
supper."	
Message	Origami	Then Maria, I will tie this up and take it outside.	
Message	Maria	Feel free to do so.	
Message	Kaguya	WHYYYYYYY?!	
Message	Kotori	"Hahaha. It's so lively in here. Rinne-oneechan, you
want more plates?"	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe, it really is. Oh, I think I'm good on the plates.
If we put any more, it'll be too crowded. We can
always replace the used plates later."	
Message	Kurumi	That seems better, considering the amount of people.	
Message	Shido	"Hmm, if there are this many people... This is pretty
crazy."	
Message	None	"(Not only are the morning people here, we also have
Origami and Kurumi as well. Something feels off,
but... Oh.)"	
Message	Shido	"Hey Kotori, what happened to Reine-san? She usually
drops by on days like this."	
Message	Kotori	"Ohhh, Reine? She said that since Origami's here,
she thought it best to not come～"	
Message	Shido	Ah, makes sense.	
Message	None	"(Unfortunately, since Reine-san is school faculty,
Origami wouldn't understand what's going on. It
would be difficult for Reine to come over.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Shido, there's so much food and so many people.
This is great!"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, this may be a first. But don't forget that this
is a celebration of Rinne's return, okay? Tohka, you
were the one that brought it up."	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah, I know! It looks like we can eat a lot of yummy
food!"	
Message	None	(Tohka, were you really listening to me...?)	
Message	Kotori	"We're all ready, Onii-chan! Now you do the toast as
the master of the house!"	
Message	Shido	Okay, okay, got it. Leave the rest to me.	
Message	None	(Well, I'm not the master of the house or anything.)	
Message	Shido	"But Rinne, would you say something before I do my
toast?"	
Message	Rinne	What... Me?	
Message	Shido	Who else? We're all gathered here for you.	
Message	Rinne	U-Um... Well, then.	
Message	Rinne	"Everyone, thanks for gathering for my sake. I would
love to actually become friends with you all this time
around."	
Message	None	"(Rinne's words made me stop breathing. Those words
seemed really cruel for Rinne. It's as if she were
saying that her connection with everyone was fake.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked over at Maria and our eyes met. Maria smiled
as if she were troubled. I knew we couldn't help it.
We were the only ones who knew.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? What are you talking about, Rinne? We're already
friends, aren't we?"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh... You're right. Thanks, Tohka-chan. Well, it's a
pleasure, you guys."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah!	
Message	Origami	"You are an obstacle I must overcome. You can't just
leave for no reason."	
Message	Yoshino	"...It's a pleasure. You... are always taking care of me,
Rinne-san."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Rinne-chan, it's a pleasure!"	
Message	Kurumi	"Rinne-san, it's a pleasure. When you are here, the
people surrounding Shido-san become more
interesting. It's truly entertaining."	
Message	Kaguya	"You seem to lack the mindset of a proper slave.
You cannot escape me even if you wanted to... I
can't believe you haven't realized that yet."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Declaration. Yuzuru and Kaguya both see you as a dear
friend."	
Message	Miku	"Rinne-san, we've been friends from the moment we
met. You're such an adorable girl."	
Message	Maria	"Hmm... It would be nice if you would also speak to me
casually, Rinne."	
Message	Rinne	Everyone... Thank you so much. I'm so happy.	
Message	None	"(I think everyone's response is their honest feelings.
Seeing everyone today makes me feel that way.)"	
Message	Shido	All right, then let's do this! Cheers!	
Message	Everyone	Cheers!	
Message	None	"(And just like that we cast away the sentimental vibe
and started our party.)"	
Message	Tohka	All right, let's cook some meat next.	
Message	Kurumi	"Tohka-san, it's not good to only eat meat. You need
to have a balanced meal."	
Message	Origami	"Tohka Yatogami is eating too much meat. At this rate,
she'll definitely turn into a pig."	
Message	Tohka	"A p-pig?! That can't be... Hey, wait a minute, Origami
Tobiichi! This is beef... It wouldn't turn me into a pig,
right?"	
Message	Origami	...I can't even talk to you.	
Message	Kurumi	My, my, looks like she's drained the poison.	
Message	Miku	Yoshino-chan, Kotori-chan, I cooked this.	
Message	Kotori	Yayyy, meat～	
Message	Yoshino	Th-Thank you.	
Message	Kaguya	"*Nom, nom*. This is really delicious. I would say this
suits me very well."	
Message	Yuzuru	Clarification. Is that a joke...? Hehe.	
Message	Kaguya	"Joke, what are you talking ab... Oh. Th-That's not it!
That was totally a coincidence!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Wry laugh. Kaguya, your sense is disappointing.	
Message	Kaguya	GRRRR! I told you it wasn't intentional!	
Message	None	"(I thought it would be more chaotic, but it seems like
everyone is doing well with each other.)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido, are you eating?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. How about you, Rinne? You're the guest of
honor today, but you're working too hard."	
Message	Rinne	"Don't worry about me. I like doing this. And more than
anything... I'm just glad everyone is having a good time."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm surprised.	
Message	Rinne	Maybe everyone is doing this for my sake.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What do you mean?	
Message	Rinne	"Normally Tohka-chan and Tobiichi-san flock around you
immediately, right? But today, it wasn't like that."	
Message	Shido	Oh, I see. Then let's switch, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Huh? What do you mean?	
Message	Shido	"Go mingle with everyone. You want to be their friend,
right?"	
Message	Rinne	"Okay, I'll take you up on your offer. Can you take
over, Shido?"	
Message	Maria	Leave it to us. I will help, too.	
Message	Shido	That's fine, but don't answer for me...	
Message	Rinne	"Thanks you two. I'm going to go hang out with
everyone, then."	
Message	Shido	All right, have fun.	
Message	Maria	Shido, you're so kind.	
Message	Shido	"Wh-Where is that coming from? You're making me
blush."	
Message	Maria	But you totally don't understand a girl's heart.	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about?	
Message	Maria	"Nothing. Let's take over Rinne's position and do it
well."	
Message	None	"(I nodded and started to move. Rinne seemed to be
talking with Tohka and the girls already.)"	
Message	Rinne	"I see. Tohka-chan, you want to improve your cooking
skills, too?"	
Message	Tohka	"Of course! That way I can make delicious things, and
I can cook for Shido, right?"	
Message	Rinne	Right. If you're serious, then I'll help you, okay?	
Message	Origami	Rinne Sonogami, if that's the case, may I join?	
Message	Rinne	I don't mind... But why?	
Message	Origami	"It's important to grab someone by the stomach. And
besides, to be quite honest, the idea of letting Tohka
Yatogami get there before me rubs me the wrong way."	
Message	Tohka	"What did you say?! You always say just what you want,
don't you?!"	
Message	Origami	"It's a personal opinion. You have no right to tell me
I can't feel this way."	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Tohka-chan, Tobiichi-san, please calm down...	
Message	None	"(Rinne is trying way more than before. Seeing her
talking to them made me smile.)"	
Message	Maria	Shido... You seem happy.	
Message	Shido	Huh? Haha... Do I really?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I see that staring at girls from afar makes you
grin like that."	
Message	Shido	B-But the way you put it is...!	
Message	None	"(...I can't tell if she's doing it on purpose or if
she's just oblivious like that. I gave a big sigh before
going back to washing the dishes.)"
