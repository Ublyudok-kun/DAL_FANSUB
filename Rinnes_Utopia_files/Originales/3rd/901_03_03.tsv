Message	None	"(Man, time really flies when you have after-school
duties. Rinne said she'd head home before me so she
could get dinner ready, so I guess I'm good.)"	
Message	None	(Hm? Did someone just come out of the house...?)	
Message	Shido	Ah, Yoshino. I knew it was you. I'm home.	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... Welcome home, Shido-san.	
Message	Yoshinon	Welcome home Shido-kun. We were just on our way\nout. Bumping into one another like this... Could it be\nfate?	
Message	Shido	On your way out? Where are you guys going?	
Message	Yoshino	U-Um... I was heading toward the station to, um...	
Message	Yoshinon	We were just on our way to go meet...	
Message	Shido	Meet? Meet who?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... Seems like there is an unwanted guest that
has interfered with our dark encounter."	
Message	Shido	Ah, Kaguya's with you, huh? Then I'm not worried.	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san... Would you like to join us?	
Message	Shido	Me too?	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, do you dare? We are about to embark on a journey
to seal the god of boredom, and witness a ceremony
to view the box of memory... The truth of truth."	
Message	Yoshino	Truth of truth?	
Message	Yoshinon	Kaguya-chan is just being mysterious. She's talking\nabout a movie.	
Message	Shido	How did you get that, Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshinon	Well I'm close to Kaguya-chan and Yuzuru-chan, so\nthis is nothing. What are you going to do, Shido-kun?\nDo you want to come? Join us?	
Message	Shido	Hm... I guess I'll take you up on your offer.	
Message	Yoshinon	Amazing, Shido-kun, you totally get it! Let's go, go,\ngo together!	
Message	Kaguya	As my servant, it's only natural... Follow me!	
Message	Yoshino	I'm happy that you're joining us, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I can't wait for the movie.	
Message	Yoshino	Yeah!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, seems like it's not too crowded. There aren't
too many people around. I think we can watch in
peace."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes. I'm so glad.	
Message	Shido	"Hopefully we won't end up having to listen to any
rowdy people watching the movie. Let's be quiet
ourselves and hope for the best."	
Message	Yoshino	O-Okay... I'll try my best...	
Message	Yoshinon	Ahhh, can't wait.	
Message	Kaguya	"I sense a heavy darkness swelling inside... Hehehe.
I cannot wait."	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya. I know you know this, but be sure to be quiet
during the movie, okay? Follow Yoshino?"	
Message	Kaguya	Shut up! That's none of your concern!	
Message	Shido	Well, that's fine. Let's go in, then.	
Message	Yoshino	Okay...!	
Message	None	(...)	
Message	None	"(It was a fantasy movie where an evil demon who had
been sealed away was resurrected. It was defeated by
the chosen hero.)"	
Message	None	"(During the movie, Yoshino and Kaguya were enthralled.
Luckily, their reactions weren't too out of control.)"	
Message	None	"(The movie seemed to be based on a famous fantasy
novel and left many potential hooks for a sequel.)"	
Message	None	"(Although there were a few cliffhangers, the movie
drew me in as well, and I was totally immersed in it.
I would say for certain that it was a good watch.)"	
Message	None	"(As we lingered in the theater, the sequel preview
began to play. After watching it, I was so curious to
know what happens next.)"	
Message	Shido	Man that sure was a good movie.	
Message	Kaguya	"Yes, it was pleasant to the eye. Ah, the ceremony of
darkness... You have led me down a worthy path."	
Message	Shido	"Haha, I bet. How did you guys like it, Yoshino?
Yoshinon?"	
Message	Yoshinon	Yeah, it was totally fun. It was worth coming!	
Message	Shido	Yeah. How about you, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshinon	YOSHINO. The movie is over.	
Message	Yoshino	Huh...? Oh... S-Sorry!	
Message	Shido	"I can see why you'd want to hang around here. It was
really fun."	
Message	Yoshino	...Yes.	
Message	Kaguya	Oh, there's a perfect spot for us over there.	
Message	None	"(Kaguya confidently pointed to a corner of the lobby.
I looked over and there was...)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, a special kiosk for the movie. You want to check
it out?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh...! Yes, I want to go!	
Message	Yoshinon	Then let's hurry on over!	
Message	Kaguya	"No matter the burdens on your shoulders, there is
power in the quest for an answer, the Answer road!
The power is in effect, for even this―"	
Message	Kaguya	Hey! Wait for me!	
Message	None	"(The special kiosk had a movie-themed display. Yoshino
stood in front of it.)"	
Message	Shido	"This is the hero's sword and the fortune teller's
crystal. These are so well-made..."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes, they look like the real ones from the movie.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe. You foolish servants. You can't tell just by
looking?"	
Message	Shido	What are you talking about...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Do you not get it? The grand magic that is being
stored in the crystal ball!"	
Message	None	"(Well, it's true that the movie plot centered around
the power that took over the protagonist's life,
but...)"	
Message	Kaguya	"This is the magic that should have resided in the
protagonist. Because of this crystal's existence, he
became the last trump card against the demon."	
Message	Yoshino	"Huh... Oh! It's true. The protagonist was the last
hope in defeating the demon... The protagonist
became ""the child of fate""... thanks to the crystal?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Exactly! The evil Ancient goddess created the
crystal in her place. It's one of the eternal dark
relics hidden away in the darkness of history."	
Message	Shido	Uh, Kaguya... That's a bit far-fetched...	
Message	Kaguya	"You stay out of this, Shido! See, the demon's curse
resides in the crystal through the protagonist. The
hero's ""protection"" became the demon's other heart."	
Message	Yoshino	...Its other heart.	
Message	None	"(I figured Kaguya didn't read the novel. This was a
backstory that Kaguya completely made up. Yoshino
looks like she's totally buying it.)"	
Message	None	(This isn't going to end well later...)	
Message	Kaguya	"However, God had spun the threads of fate to overcome
even that. It is in front of you now, right Yoshino?"	
Message	Yoshino	The holy sword... Stardust Overture...	
Message	Kaguya	"Exactly. Therein lies the power to fulfill your desires,
drawn from the audience to create an infinite prism.
Resound the bells of Ragnarok to destroy all evil!"	
Message	Yoshino	Whoa...	
Message	Kaguya	"""It's a replica. Just a fake.""...Or so they thought.\nBut they were wrong."	
Message	Yoshino	Amazing...	
Message	Yoshinon	It is amazing... but Kaguya-chan, is it really real?	
Message	Kaguya	O-Of course! I-I would never lie?!	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you would.	
Message	Yoshinon	You're totally lying～!	
Message	Kaguya	H-Hey, what gives?! I told you, I'm not lying!	
Message	Shido	Because you obviously look guilty.	
Message	Kaguya	T-Totally not true! Shido, you have me all wrong!	
Message	Yoshino	"...It's true, though. I feel like I can sense some
powers."	
Message	Shido	Y-Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	The sword... is reacting to my emotions...?	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, um, Yoshino? That's just the ray of the sunset
coming in through the window..."	
Message	Yoshino	Wow... What you said was true, Kaguya-san.	
Message	Kaguya	"H-Hmph! Of course it is! With my powers, it's only
natural!"	
Message	None	"(She's completely losing the opportunity to back
out of it...)"	
Message	Shido	Kaguya.	
Message	Kaguya	Wh-What is it... Shido.	
Message	Shido	"I don't think you should be saying, ""Of course it is!
What are you going to do now? Yoshino is totally
believing you!"""	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh, uh... That's... I have no idea what you're talking
about..."	
Message	Shido	"You're the one who made this up. You'd better come
clean, or Yoshino will be hurt."	
Message	Kaguya	...*Grunt*! Okay...	
Message	Kaguya	H-Hey, Yoshino?	
Message	Yoshino	"As you said Kaguya-san... This is the real one. With
special powers..."	
Message	Kaguya	"Well, you know... it's...? I may have overexaggerated.
Or rather, the one here doesn't have such powers...."	
Message	Yoshino	"But... You're amazing, Kaguya-san. You can tell just
by looking at it. "	
Message	Kaguya	"Well, um... That was... I just blurted it out, or rather...
It was a joke..."	
Message	Yoshino	I respect you, Kaguya-san!	
Message	Kaguya	"I see, I see! You're my amazing servant. You know
what's up. Hahahahahaha!"	
Message	Shido	"Kaguya... You made it even worse, so I'm not going to
help you out of this one. Like I said before, you'd
better explain it to her before we get home, okay?"	
Message	Kaguya	"Aw, what?! I'm sorry! I was wrong, so don't abandon
me!"	
Message	None	"(As we left the movie theater, we explained to Yoshino
that it was just a joke, and by the time we got back
home, Yoshino was finally able to understand.)"	
Message	Shido	Aren't you lucky that Yoshino understood?	
Message	Kaguya	*Whimper*... I'm sorry...	
Message	None	"(We just had Yoshino settle by promising that we'd
watch the next movie with her, but I had a sense that
we'd need to watch what Kaguya said in the future.)"
