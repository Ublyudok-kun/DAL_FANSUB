Message	Maria	"It's usually so lively, so it feels lonely when it's
just the two of us."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, especially compared to the party yesterday.	
Message	None	"(After eating dinner, we cleaned up and finally settled
in.)"	
Message	None	"(Today's dinner was just Maria and myself. According
to Maria, Rinne held a cooking class at the Spirit
mansion.)"	
Message	None	"(I was going to head over there after hearing that,
but all dishes would need Rinne's approval before I
could eat them, so they all put up a good fight.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess you'd be conferred full mastership, huh?	
Message	Maria	"Conferred full mastership? What are you talking about,
Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, you're the only one who Rinne approves of in the
cooking realm, right? I mean, you made breakfast with
her in the morning, too."	
Message	Maria	"Do you think so? At the very least, Shido, I thought
you liked Rinne's cooking more."	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not true. Rinne is Rinne. Maria is Maria.
I can't compare you two. You both make really
delicious food."	
Message	Maria	"Although I arrange it a bit differently, my cooking is
all a copy of yours, Shido. So for you to say it's good
gives me mixed feelings."	
Message	Shido	"That's not true, Maria. You put your heart into it
when you cook. If someone likes it, that means you're
a great cook."	
Message	Maria	"Thank you, Shido. Then I will do my best so you can
say once again that it's delicious."	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	None	"(Seeing Maria's pure smile made me feel a little
embarrassed, and I looked away toward the clock.)"	
Message	Shido	"It's about the same time as yesterday... Hey, Maria.
Is it okay if I go out on a stroll?"	
Message	Maria	"Understood. I'm not going to ask you where you are
going, but... Please be careful."	
Message	Shido	Got it. Thanks.	
Message	None	"(Rio said she'll be at the park. I'm sure no one will
interrupt us this late.)"	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Whoa... Hey Rinne, welcome back.	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, Shido. Are you heading out?	
Message	Shido	Uhhh, yeah. I'm going to go walk off my dinner.	
Message	Rinne	"Again? You went out last night, too. Are you hiding
something from me?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, it's not like that...	
Message	Maria	"Rinne, it's fine. He's just going out for a stroll.
I guess he ate too much."	
Message	Rinne	"I see. That's fine, but... it's cold out, so be sure
to come home soon, okay? You were late last
night..."	
Message	Shido	"S-Sorry. I'll try to get home as soon as possible
tonight. See you later."	
Message	Rinne	"Okay, later. After I clean up a little, I'm going to
go home. So don't worry Maria-chan too much,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	Got it.	
Message	Rinne	Well, good night.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, good night.	
Message	Maria	Hehe... That was a close one.	
Message	Shido	...Wh-What are you talking about?	
Message	Maria	Nothing.	
Message	None	(I wonder if Maria knows. That I'm seeing Marina.)	
Message	None	"(No... Maybe I'm thinking too much about it. But she
must be thinking I'm hiding something.)"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I'll be on my way now. Oh, should I drop by the
convenience store?"	
Message	Maria	...Hmmm. Would you buy me some pudding?	
Message	Shido	Pudding? Got it. Any kind's okay?	
Message	Maria	Yes. Be safe. I'll see you later.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, later... Hm?	
Message	None	"(Maria seemed a bit strange... Well, I should hurry up
and go to the park now.)"	
Message	Shido	She should be here, right?	
Message	None	"(Rio said the park, but I couldn't tell if it was the
small park nearby or the big one.)"	
Message	None	"(I went to the small park, but Rio didn't seem to be
there. So I tried coming here, but...)"	
Message	Shido	Wait, is that...?	
Message	Marina	So you did come, Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	Hey, Marina. Haven't seen you at all since yesterday.	
Message	Marina	"Gosh, you sure are acting all chummy. I don't really
care to see you."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*...	
Message	Marina	No... She really wanted to see you!	
Message	Shido	...Excuse me?	
Message	Marina	Now which one is the truth? Which do you think it is?	
Message	Shido	I...	
Choice		How should I know?	
Choice		What if you actually have a crush on me? Just kidding.	
Message	Shido	"How should I know? That's something only you'd
know, Marina."	
Message	Marina	Oh. What a noble answer. You're no fun at all.	
Message	Shido	It's not... about fun or not.	
Message	Marina	Okay, okay, fine then, justice hero.	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's your problem...	
Message	None	"(Marina seems to be a little different today. I don't
know why, though.)"	
Message	Shido	What if you actually have a crush on me? Just kidding.	
Message	Marina	...!	
Message	Shido	Hm? What's the matter, Marina?	
Message	Marina	"I was just thrown off by your joke! Of course that's
not true!"	
Message	Shido	"I was only kidding. Anyways, you were the one who
started joking first."	
Message	Marina	"Well... true. But those kinds of jokes annoy me. Of
course there'd be no way... I'm the same as Maria."	
Message	Shido	Um, well... Sorry.	
Message	Marina	It's fine. I don't care.	
Message	None	"(Marina looked away. She seemed to be a little
different from the Marina I knew.)"	
Message	None	"(That's right. She's very similar to Maria. I guess
given their relationship, it's natural.)"	
Message	Rio	Oh, Papa!	
Message	None	(Rio popped up from a bench nearby.)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rio. I've come to see you.	
Message	Rio	"Hehehe. I'm happy you came to see me, Papa. Will you
help me too?"	
Message	Shido	Help you? What do you need help with, Rio?	
Message	Rio	Hmm. Well, I'm looking for the most important thing.	
Message	Shido	"The most important thing...? So what happens if you
don't find it?"	
Message	Rio	It'll all be gone.	
Message	Shido	All... be gone? Wait...	
Message	Marina	"Rio... You still haven't told Shido Itsuka the secret of
this world yet?"	
Message	Shido	The secret of this world?	
Message	Marina	Yes, the secret. About the incomplete Eden.	
Message	Shido	Eden...?! So we are inside Eden?!	
Message	Marina	"What do you want to do, Rio? Is it okay to tell
everything to Shido Itsuka?"	
Message	Rio	If Papa will help me, it's fine.	
Message	Marina	So she says. What do you want to do, Papa?	
Message	Shido	"...I want to help her for now. But depending on what
she says, I may not be able to help."	
Message	Marina	Ahaha! You're too honest. But I like that about you.	
Message	Rio	"I like the honest part about you too, Papa! So it's
okay. You can tell him, Marina."	
Message	Marina	"Then let's keep it quick. There's a time limit to this
world, the incomplete Eden."	
Message	Shido	"A time limit? Does that mean if we just do nothing,
we can get out of here?"	
Message	Marina	"Yeah, to put it simply. You can just run out the
clock. This world is very unstable and dangerous.
Seeing Rio here, I think it'll last another week."	
Message	None	"(Oh my God. So then everything will be resolved on
its own. I just need to wait for it to happen and―)"	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(Suddenly I felt a pang of pain in my heart. Before I
could figure out why, Marina continued on.)"	
Message	Marina	"But you see, Rio's different. She thinks that this
world should continue to exist. That's her purpose
and her role."	
Message	Rio	"Rio wants to make everyone very, very happy. Papa,
Mama, Marina, everyone! See, I think we can only be
happy here."	
Message	Shido	"But if we do that... Wouldn't Rinne be in a lot of
pain? Repeating time over and over, all alone? And in
the end, it'll still be the same. Am I wrong?"	
Message	Marina	"Shido Itsuka, you sure are level headed. I'm a bit
surprised. That makes me love you more."	
Message	Shido	You never loved me, though...	
Message	Marina	"Hahaha... Was it that obvious? But you see, it's not
the answer you're thinking of, Shido Itsuka. I mean,
Rinne Sonogami isn't involved with this Eden."	
Message	Shido	Rinne's not involved?! That can't be...	
Message	Rio	"See, Papa... Rio is the one making this Eden. Rio's
working hard."	
Message	Shido	You're... supporting this Eden?	
Message	None	"(I should have considered that. But when she actually
said it, it seemed so impossible.)"	
Message	Rio	"But Rio doesn't have big powers. So... I need to find
the most important thing."	
Message	Marina	"As Rio stated, she can't be the only one maintaining
Eden. She needs another piece to solidify this world.
That's the most important thing."	
Message	None	"(A piece to solidify this world... The most important
thing... A piece of the world. Proof that Eden―that
Rinne existed.)"	
Message	None	(It's―)	
Message	Shido	...!	
Message	None	"(I thought about the spare key. One you can't say is
in reality or Eden. It's uncertain... but definitely
something important.)"	
Message	Marina	"You look like you know what it is. Do you know the
answer?"	
Message	Shido	"Well... I can't say for sure. I can't gather my
thoughts."	
Message	Marina	I see. Then we'll leave it at that.	
Message	Shido	What do you mean?	
Message	Marina	Beats me. Why don't you ask yourself?	
Message	None	(...I guess I can't hide it from Marina.)	
Message	Rio	Hm? Papa, what's the matter?	
Message	Shido	Nothing. I was just thinking about something.	
Message	Rio	"I see. But you're going to help me look for it, right
Papa?"	
Message	Shido	Uh... Hm...	
Message	Marina	Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	Hm?	
Message	Marina	"You'd best think hard, or you might regret it. Maria,
Rio, Rinne Sonogami... and me. If this world
disappears, so will we."	
Message	Shido	...I know.	
Message	None	"(I knew it all too well. That's why I felt the pain in
my heart earlier. The pain of having to lose something
I lost once again.)"	
Message	None	"(If I let it remain, I guess it'll be resolved. But
will I be okay with that? Is that really the right
decision?)"	
Message	None	"(The more I thought, the less I knew. I felt myself
wavering on making a decision. My mind was like a
pendulum going back and forth. I couldn't decide.)"	
Message	None	"(The Ruler―Rinne―said that there was happiness in
this world. And I denied that. The happiness given to
me was nothing to the small happinesses I obtained.)"	
Message	None	"(But I was able to say that because I didn't know
anything. It's because I didn't think that Rinne would
live here endlessly that I was able to say that.)"	
Message	None	"(But what about now? The same thing is going to
repeat itself. Can I let that happen?)"	
Message	None	"(I can, I can't. I can, I can't. I can. I can't. I couldn't
make up my mind, and time continued to pass...)"	
Message	Rio	Papa? Are you okay?	
Message	Shido	...?! Yeah, I'm fine. I've made my decision for now.	
Message	Marina	"You're always so indecisive, but you came up with an
answer that fast? Are you more clever than I thought?
Or did you think so hard that you went mad?"	
Message	Shido	"Why are you saying that?! I haven't gathered my
thoughts yet... but for now I'll help. I want to
continue to be with you both, Rio and Marina."	
Message	Rio	Hahaha. Papa, I love you! Let's find it together!	
Message	Marina	"It should be so easy for you to just cut us off
because we don't really exist... You're so dumb."	
Message	Rio	What's the matter, Marina? Your face looks red.	
Message	Marina	I'm just a bit cold. Don't worry about it, Rio.	
Message	None	"(She smiled warmly and patted Rio's head. They looked
like siblings.)"	
Message	Shido	You sure are an awesome big sister.	
Message	Rio	"Big sister? Rio doesn't have a big sister...
"	
Message	Rio	Marina is a friend!	
Message	Marina	Yes. Friends.	
Message	Shido	I see. Aren't you happy, Marina?	
Message	Marina	"""Don't ""Are you happy?"" me. That makes no sense.
Shouldn't you go home soon?"""	
Message	Shido	"Oh, look at the time. Kotori might be home, too...
I'm sure Maria's waiting."	
Message	Marina	"I'm going to make Rio rest, so hurry up and go home.
She's looking forward to the pudding."	
Message	Shido	"I'll do that. Tomorrow's my day off, so I'll help you in
the morning. Is that okay, Rio?"	
Message	Rio	Okay. Let's do it together, Papa.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	Marina	"Then let's meet up at the nearby park. Take care of
Rio, Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Okay. I'm going home now. See you both tomorrow.	
Message	Rio	Okay. Bye-bye, Papa! I can't wait!	
Message	Marina	Hurry home... Later, Shido.	
Message	None	"(I split ways with Marina and Rio. But as I walked
home with the pudding from the store, all I could
think of was the decision I couldn't make.)"	
Message	None	"(I promised Rio that I'd help her find it. But I know
she won't. No matter how much she goes through the
town looking for traces of Rinne, she won't find it.)"	
Message	Shido	What should I do...	
Message	None	"(I muttered the question as I walked, but there was
no one to answer me.)"
