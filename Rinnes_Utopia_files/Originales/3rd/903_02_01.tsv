Message	Shido	I'm home.	
Message	Rinne	Welcome back, Shido. Dinner's ready.	
Message	Shido	"Oh, thanks for taking care of it. Kotori and the others
still cooking?"	
Message	Rinne	"They're ordering food and doing things here and
there. Kotori-chan said it's important for research..."	
Message	Shido	"Seems like their goal is changing drastically... Then
did you eat with the girls, Rinne?"	
Message	Rinne	"No, not yet. I figured I'd wait for you. And also, I
borrowed Kotori-chan's key... I hope that's not a
problem?"	
Message	Shido	"...Oh, I see. Of course it's not. You're always looking
out for us."	
Message	None	"(Rinne should have memories of the past. But even
after we reunited, she never once asked for the spare
key.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if I'm assuming too much for thinking that
she's deliberately avoiding the subject.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Anyways, Shido... Who's the girl behind you that's
staring at me?"	
Message	Shido	Behind me? Oh... 	
Message	Rio	"Papa, you're talking too much! How long should Rio
wait?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry Rio. You can come in.	
Message	Rio	Thank you.	
Message	Rinne	P-Papa? Papa... Shido, what's―	
Message	Rio	―MAMA!	
Message	Rinne	Huh? What? Mama... Are you talking about me?	
Message	Rio	"Yeah, Mama! Rinne Sonogami, Rio's mama. She's so
nice and really cute."	
Message	Rinne	Um... Should I say thank you?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I think that's fine. Rio seems happy to see you,
Rinne."	
Message	Rio	Today, I spent all day with Papa! It was so fun!	
Message	Rinne	...Shido, can you explain?	
Message	Shido	"Uh, you see... She's Rio Sonogami. She seems to think
I'm Papa and you're Mama."	
Message	Rinne	Shido is Papa... and I'm Mama... huh.	
Message	Marina	"Hey, it's annoying that you're blushing like that. A
good wife shouldn't just leave her guests unattended,
now should she?"	
Message	Rinne	Huh?! I'm so sorry... Maria-chan?	
Message	Marina	"Don't talk to me like I'm my little sister. I'm Marina.
Marina Arusu."	
Message	Rinne	Marina...chan?	
Message	Marina	Don't "chan" me. It gives me the creeps.	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Rinne, this is Maria's older sister. She's kind of
crass, but she's good on the inside, just like Maria."	
Message	Marina	"Hey, I said don't put me in the same category as
Maria! Gosh, Shido Itsuka, are you trying to start a
fight with me?"	
Message	Shido	I have no plans to do that at all, to be honest.	
Message	Rinne	*Giggle*... Hehehe.	
Message	Marina	What are you laughing about?	
Message	Rinne	No, it just seems like you two are close.	
Message	Marina	Wh-What?! Shido Itsuka and I aren't close―	
Message	Rio	"Marina, you're always so worried about Papa. And
besides, you two were talking together today! Mama,
Marina, and Papa are friends."	
Message	Rinne	I knew it. I was thinking the same thing, Rio-chan.	
Message	Rio	Really?! Mama, you really are Rio's mama!	
Message	Marina	"Seems like I can't win against that... It's fine. Then
how about a change of scenery? How long are we going
to just stand here?"	
Message	Shido	You're right. Let's start by coming in, you two.	
Message	Rio	Okay. Oh, so this is your home, Papa.	
Message	Rinne	"Rio-chan. Why don't you sit on the sofa? Shido, I'll
go pour some tea."	
Message	Shido	Thanks.	
Message	Marina	...Seems like nothing's happened so far.	
Message	Shido	It's fine, Marina. I don't think anything will happen.	
Message	Marina	"You can think that all you want, but don't force it on
me.
"	
Message	Marina	I wonder if you'd still be like this when you're older...	
Message	Shido	...Marina?	
Message	Marina	Nothing. I'm coming in.	
Message	Shido	Welcome, Marina.	
Message	Rinne	Shido, do you want to eat?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Oh, but we might be short since we have more
people, huh?"	
Message	Rinne	Oh... I see. What should I do?	
Message	Shido	"All right then, let's make some rice balls. That way,
we can share the main dish and still eat a lot."	
Message	Rio	Rice balls? Okay, Rio wants to eat rice balls!	
Message	Rinne	Then let me make them. Give me a moment.	
Message	Shido	Oh, don't worry. You sit, Rinne. I'll make them.	
Message	Rinne	"What, but I promised you this morning... That I'd
make dinner..."	
Message	Rio	Yeah, Mama. Mama, sit next to Rio and let's talk.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Then why don't we talk, Rio-chan.	
Message	None	"(Rio bounced up and down on the sofa as she called
for Rinne. Rinne took a seat next to her.)"	
Message	None	"(Now I need to go to the kitchen to make rice
balls...)"	
Message	Shido	...Marina?	
Message	Marina	"It'll take longer if you're alone, right? Let me help
you."	
Message	Shido	What's gotten into you?	
Message	Marina	"Gosh, you're so obtuse. It's best to give a mom and
daughter their privacy at a time like this."	
Message	Shido	"...You're right. When it comes to Rio, you seem to
care more about others. You're like her real older
sister."	
Message	Marina	"...That's not it. I'm just playing a role right now.
I'm doing it because I want to. That's all."	
Message	Shido	Marina... Are you...	
Message	None	(Lonely? I was about to say it, but I stopped.)	
Message	None	(Marina seems lonely, yet she looked satisfied.)	
Message	Marina	"Come on. Let's hurry up and make them. Rio, and
I'm sure you and Rinne Sonogami, are hungry too."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Anyways...	
Message	Marina	...Why are you staring?	
Message	Shido	Can you cook at all?	
Message	Shido	..?! Where did all this come from?!	
Message	Marina	"Shido Itsuka... Stop making fun of me. Forget you.
Don't you dare help me with this!"	
Message	None	"(Marina looked annoyed and walked toward the kitchen.
However, unlike her face, her footsteps were light.
I'm not going to tell her that it made me laugh.)"	
Message	Rio	"So I went to a family restaurant for the first time.
I ate so much with Papa!"	
Message	Rinne	"I see, that's nice. What did you eat with Shido... I
mean, Papa?"	
Message	Rio	"Um... I ate a Hamburg steak. And omurice. And meat
sauce!"	
Message	Rinne	Wow, amazing. Was it good?	
Message	Rio	"Yeah, it was so yummy! Papa and Maria-onechan were
with me, so it was oh-so delicious."	
Message	Marina	...Here, it's ready.	
Message	Rio	Wow, rice balls! Thanks, Marina.	
Message	None	"(The rice balls that Marina brought were in a size that
would fit perfectly in Rio's hand.)"	
Message	Marina	Why is Maria "One-chan" and you just call me Marina?	
Message	Rio	Because... You're not like an older sister, Marina?	
Message	Marina	Okay, fine. Is that so... Gosh, you're so random.	
Message	Rinne	From what I see, you two act like real siblings.	
Message	Marina	"Don't just say that. You think you're going to fool me
just by smiling like that?"	
Message	Rinne	Huh...? I didn't mean it like that...	
Message	Shido	Hey, Marina?!	
Message	Marina	"I'm sure you're fine with it. As long as you spit out kind
words, no one fights back."	
Message	Rinne	I... didn't mean it like that.	
Message	None	"(Marina, just quit it. That's what I wanted to say, but
I couldn't.)"	
Message	Marina	"I'm fine with being last. I should just be nice to
everyone. Gosh, you think you're so high and mighty?
Or what, you think this is some kind of repentance?"	
Message	Rinne	...?! No―	
Message	Marina	"No, I'm right. You're just scared. Of disappearing from
this world again. And you're worried that Shido will
feel pain because of it."	
Message	Rinne	.....	
Message	Rio	Ma...ma...?	
Message	Marina	"That's why even when you notice something's off,
you just ignore it and go on living your daily life.
That's just messed up. Wrong. It's ridiculous!"	
Message	Rinne	I'm not thinking like that...!	
Message	Marina	"You like that Rio calls you Mama. You even got close
to Maria. Your existence here is totally normal.
You're starting to think, "I can be here!""	
Message	Rinne	No... that's not true... I'm not thinking that...	
Message	Marina	"Of course you are. You're the same as me. You
disappear if this world ends. That's all your existence
amounts to."	
Message	Rinne	"...I know that. I know that... But what do you want me
to do? What should I have done?!"	
Message	Marina	"I told you. You should forget everything and move
towards the future. How about you?"	
Message	Rinne	Then Shido... Shido will once again...!	
Message	Rio	Marina, stop it!	
Message	Marina	...!	
Message	Rio	Mama is crying...? So are you, Marina.	
Message	Marina	How am I crying?	
Message	Rio	Marina, you're crying.	
Message	Marina	"...Hmph. So you say. Gosh, I really can't deal with
any of you guys."	
Message	Rinne	U-Um... Marina-san, where are you...	
Message	Maria	...I'm sorry. It seems like Marina has caused trouble.	
Message	None	(The next time she spoke, it was Maria.)	
Message	Shido	Maria?! What happened to Marina?	
Message	Maria	"Marina is still inside of me. I don't think she'll come
out anymore today."	
Message	Maria	"...To lock herself in, despite having the chance to be
free. You must have struck her where it hurt most."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	None	"(Rio said that Marina was crying, too. I remember what
Marina told me earlier this evening.)"	
Message	None	"(So she must have been acting tough. She said all
that to Rinne, but in reality, Marina didn't want to
disappear, either. That's why she said that to Rinne.)"	
Message	None	"(Both what Rinne said and what Marina said... I
understood both so much that it hurt.)"	
Message	Rio	Mama, are you okay?	
Message	Rinne	Yes, I'm fine. But Marina-san is Maria-chan?	
Message	Maria	"No, that's not entirely accurate. It's true that Marina
and I are sharing a body in this world, but our
minds are independent."	
Message	Rinne	I see... Shido, did you know?	
Message	Shido	Yeah I did. Sorry for not explaining anything to you.	
Message	Rinne	"No it's fine. I understand the situation. I'm worried
about Marina-san..."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I'm worried about Marina, too. Hey, Maria... Do
you retain Marina's memories, too?"	
Message	Maria	"Just a little, I would say. However, I can figure out
what happened based on this tension. I'm sorry, Rio.
You were supposed to have fun with your family."	
Message	Rio	"No, it's okay. Mama and Marina are both my family.
I'm happier when they are friends."	
Message	Maria	Rio... You're such a nice girl.	
Message	Rio	Does Marina hate Rio now?	
Message	Maria	"No, that's not it. She was just too sensitive to Rio's
words. Anyways, the rice balls are going to get cold."	
Message	Rio	Oh! *nom, nom*... This is so yummy!	
Message	Maria	Yes. This must be proof that Marina loves you, Rio.	
Message	Rio	Yeah! Thanks for the delicious rice balls, Marina!	
Message	Shido	Rio, saying it now...	
Message	Maria	No. I'm sure she heard.	
Message	None	"(Maria kindly patted Rio's hair. Just like the time she
let Rio sleep on her lap at the park.)"	
Message	Rinne	I'm... sorry, Marina-san.	
Message	Maria	Rinne?	
Message	Rinne	"You see, I think I was a bit naïve. I tried not to
think about it. I kept telling myself that the world
wouldn't end. But I realized once Marina-san said it."	
Message	Rinne	"I, too, have to come up with my own answers.
Letting Shido or the flow take me away... that's just
me running away from my problems."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	"Oh... This rice ball is delicious. A different taste from
Shido's, mine, or Maria-chan's..."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	"...Now that I'm done eating, I'm going to head out
now, okay? Good night, Rio-chan, Maria-chan. See you
guys around."	
Message	Maria	Okay. Good night, Rinne.	
Message	Rio	...Mama, you can't go.	
Message	Rinne	Rio-chan...?	
Message	Rio	"Marina is gone today. So let's be together until
tomorrow."	
Message	Rinne	Um... What should I do...	
Message	Shido	If you're okay with it Rinne, I think that's fine.	
Message	Maria	"I see. I will leave it to you, Rinne. Rio doesn't seem
to want to be with me."	
Message	Rio	That's not true. Rio loves Maria-onechan.	
Message	Maria	"Hehe... I know. But today, you can be with Rinne all
you want."	
Message	Rio	Okay! Rio is going to sleep with Mama.	
Message	Rinne	Then let's be together today, Rio-chan.	
Message	Rio	Okay!	
Message	Shido	Then good night. See you tomo―hm?	
Message	None	"(I was going to wave, but Rio had already grabbed my
hand.)"	
Message	Shido	...Rio? Um, you have to let go of my sleeve.	
Message	Rio	I want to be with Papa, too.	
Message	Shido	Whaat... I don't know about that...	
Message	Rio	Family time? We're going to sleep next to each other!	
Message	Rinne	A...haha... What do you want to do, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Hmm...	
Message	None	"(Although this is Rio's request, I don't think I can
sleep with Rinne...)"	
Message	Maria	"You don't have to think about it so hard. Just sleep
together."	
Message	Rinne	"Huh? W-Wait Maria-chan?! What are you saying...?
Sleep with Shido?!"	
Message	Maria	"I've done it before, so I can say for a fact that
nothing will happen. And besides, Rio is small enough
for the three of you to sleep together in one bed."	
Message	Rinne	You did that with Shido while I was gone...	
Message	Shido	W-Wait. Maria was just in a daze when she came in...	
Message	Rinne	I see... Is that so.	
Message	None	(*Grunt*... Rinne's stare is painful.)	
Message	Rio	Hey, Papa, Mama? Can we...?	
Message	Rinne	Fine... Only today.	
Message	Rio	Really?!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rinne...	
Message	None	"(I can't say no since I also did it with Maria. So I
just sighed and nodded.)"	
Message	Rio	"Yay! Good one, Maria-onechan! Now I can be with
Papa and Mama today!"	
Message	Maria	Right? Hehehe...	
Message	None	(Maria, your laugh is scaring me.)	
Message	Rinne	"Anyways, you want to go to my house? I feel like
Shido's room will be hard to clean up."	
Message	Shido	"Y-Yeah. That's fine, but... it's not like I have anything
suspicious there!"	
Message	Rinne	"Hehe... I didn't say that. But if you're going to
react like that, maybe you do have something."	
Message	Shido	S-Seriously, I don't!	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. I'm only kidding.	
Message	Rio	Then let's go to Mama's home!	
Message	Rinne	"All right. We can take a bath together. So then... can
you come by in an hour, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	Got it. An hour from now.	
Message	Rio	"Huh? Papa, Mama, you aren't going to take a bath
together?"	
Message	Shido & Rinne	We will not!	
Message	None	"(Both Rinne and I reacted the same way at Rio's
suggestion.)"	
Message	None	(So now we're in bed together, but...)	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha... I-It kinda feels... weird, huh?	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... Doesn't it?	
Message	None	"(Rinne and I are sleeping in the same bed... I can't
believe it.―But there's a small being fidgeting
between us.)"	
Message	Rio	Hehe. Papa and mama together. Rio's so happy.	
Message	Shido	I see, you're happy... That's good.	
Message	Rio	Papa and Mama, you're warm.	
Message	None	"(Rio moved her body between us like she was a little
kitten.)"	
Message	Rio	"Papa and Mama, if you guys are far away, it's too
cold. Come close, please."	
Message	Shido	C-Closer...	
Message	Rio	Come on Papa, this way!	
Message	None	(Rio yanked my arm.)	
Message	Rio	Mama, closer too. Okay?	
Message	Rinne	Okay... Rio-chan, you seem so happy. 	
Message	Rio	Yeah. When I'm happy, you smile.	
Message	Rinne	"I see. That's right... When you're happy, people smile,
huh..."	
Message	None	(Rinne laughed, but she seemed a little sad.)	
Message	Rio	Rio wants everyone to be happy.	
Message	Rinne	Rio-chan, that's...	
Message	Rio	"Once I find the most important thing, everyone can
be happy, right?"	
Message	None	"(If Rio finds the most important thing, then Eden―
this fake utopia―will be complete.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Hey, Rio-chan? Who do you think the happiness
will be for?"	
Message	Rio	Hm? I don't know... Happiness is happiness, right?	
Message	Shido	Well, Rio...	
Message	Rinne	"It's fine, Shido. I'm sure Rio-chan is like I was in
the past."	
Message	Shido	Rinne... As in when you were the Ruler?	
Message	None	(Rinne nodded gently.)	
Message	Rio	Hey... Mama, can I ask you something?	
Message	Rinne	Sure. Ask me anything.	
Message	Rio	Um, Mama... Are you happy?	
Message	Rinne	...I don't know.	
Message	Rio	...Mama?	
Message	None	"(Rinne hugged Rio tightly. I could tell, being right
next to them.)"	
Message	Rio	"When you hug me tight Mama, it feels soft. I have
Papa and Mama together... Rio is so happy..."	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Mama is happy, too...	
Message	Rio	Mama's happy, too... That makes me ha...ppy...	
Message	Rinne	...Good night, Rio-chan.	
Message	None	"(Rinne said softly, but it seemed like she was about
to cry. Was I imagining that?)"	
Message	None	"(Just as I thought, I couldn't fall asleep. Rinne and
Rio were already sleeping. Their peaceful breathing
was synchronized like a real mother and daughter.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm so glad this wasn't my room. Or else, I might
have given it to her.)"	
Message	None	(The "important thing" of hers left in my room.)	
Message	None	"This is... proof... that you acknowledged me as
family. As someone important. That's why I absolutely
don't want to lose it... Is that selfish of me?"	
Message	None	"(And this is what I saw last before coming to this
world. Proof... of family.)"	
Message	None	"(Does Rinne remember? Maybe she's forgotten...
But even if she did remember... she won't bring it
up.)"	
Message	None	"(Rio is trying to find the most important thing to
continue this Eden. She believed that was everyone's
happiness.)"	
Message	None	"(I feel like I was able to understand Rio just a
little bit today. Rio must have been born from Rinne.
From the former Rinne―the Ruler.)"	
Message	None	"(That's why Rio must be trying to continue this world.
Rinne isn't saying she wants to continue it. No, she
can't. That's why Rio must have been born.)"	
Message	None	"If that paradise you speak of truly existed...
Then, both good and bad things would end up
unfolding the way I'd want them to."	
Message	None	"But... Can you really call that a paradise?!
Can you really be satisfied with such a superficial,
convenient happiness?!"	
Message	None	"(I remembered a lot of things and kept thinking over
and over. But still, I couldn't find an answer.)"	
Message	None	"(But I'm a bit lost in this temptation. Maybe I don't
have to choose. I can let time tell. Maybe I'll be fine
with that.)"	
Choice		I can't let that happen.	
Choice		It's easier if I let that happen.	
Message	None	"(No, I can't let that happen. If I don't do anything,
I'll be the one who'll regret it the most.)"	
Message	None	"(I won't think about it for now... because seeing such
happy sleeping faces makes me think that I too will
feel happiness.)"	
Message	None	"(I bet you it'll be easier if I let that happen.
I won't have to carry such a heavy burden.)"	
Message	None	"(But I can't do that. To be the one who takes everyone
else's bright futures away. I can't cut them off with
my choice like Marina says.)"	
Message	None	"(I'm going to stop thinking for now... I just want to
enjoy this happy moment.)"
