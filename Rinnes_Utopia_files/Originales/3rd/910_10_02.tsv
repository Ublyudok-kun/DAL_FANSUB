Message	Tonomachi	Yo, Itsuka. What a coincidence.	
Message	Shido	Oh, Tonomachi...	
Message	Tonomachi	"What the hell, man! You could greet me with a
little more enthusiasm, you bastard!"	
Message	Shido	"You're putting words in my mouth! Oh, come to
think of it. Tonomachi, what would you consider
the most important thing...?"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Hm? The hell, Itsuka? The answer to that seems
obvious."	
Message	Shido	Obvious? What is it?	
Message	Tonomachi	Of course. To me, the most important thing is...	
Message	Tonomachi	 Right?!	
Message	None	"(Tonomachi glanced up at the sky, wearing
a grave expression. Then, he glared at me.)"	
Message	Tonomachi	...but I won't tell you.	
Message	Shido	"You're not going to tell me?! Man, you are
no help―"	
Message	Tonomachi	"Wait, wait, Itsuka-kun. This is what's most
important to me..."	
Message	Shido	...Hm? Your cell?	
Message	None	(You'll be my lover forever, right?)	
Message	Tonomachi	"This! This is it! This is my idea of paradise!
Someone kind, a step-sister who loves her big
brother. This is what's most important to me!"	
Message	Shido	...Right.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Huh? What's the matter, Itsuka? That was a
weak response. I just admitted what's most
important to me."	
Message	Shido	...No, never mind. I was wrong for asking.	
Message	Tonomachi	"Itsuka? Where you goin'? Hey! HEY! Itsuka!
IIIIITSUUUUKAAA! Where you goin'?! I'm not
done. Come on, you serious?! ITSUKA! COME BACK!"	
Message	None	"(I'm going to ignore Tonomachi's answer,
and continue searching.)"
