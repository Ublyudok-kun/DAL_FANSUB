Message	Shido	"All right, we made it. Seems like we had plenty of
time."	
Message	Rinne	Seems like it. But I'm all sweaty because I ran.	
Message	Shido	"...Sorry about that. I should have checked the time
better."	
Message	Maria	"Phew... Gosh. Shido, you have no sense of planning.
That's no good."	
Message	Rinne	"I think you're right. Shido looks serious, but he's
pretty careless at times."	
Message	Shido	Hey, what's your guys' problem...	
Message	Maria	We just know you well. That's all.	
Message	Rinne	That's right. We basically know the good and the bad.	
Message	Shido	When you put it that way, you're making me blush...	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, Shido-san. You're quite late today. Not only that,
but school just started... and you have two beautiful
women on each side. You sure are a boy of your age."	
Message	Shido	Kurumi?! Why are you...?!	
Message	Kurumi	"What are you so surprised about? I'm your classmate,
so of course I'd be here."	
Message	Shido	Oh, that's right...	
Message	None	"(I recalled a memory from before. The Kurumi in Eden
was a clone based in the shrine.)"	
Message	None	"(Seems like the one trapping us now has a similar
power to Eden, but... It seems like it hasn't completely
replicated what life was like before.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"That sure seems to be a low-effort answer. Just
because girls like you so easily, your reaction to this
hurts my feelings. I think I'll cry."	
Message	Shido	S-Sorry. I was just in a daze...	
Message	Kurumi	"Then, to show your penitence, would you pat my head
now?"	
Message	Shido	Of course not! That'll give people the wrong idea!	
Message	Kurumi	"My, my, how unfortunate. But Shido-san... Just because
Rinne is back doesn't mean you should let your guard
down."	
Message	Shido	Right. Thanks.	
Message	None	"(...Seems like Kurumi also recognizes Rinne as my
childhood friend.)"	
Message	None	"""(Come to think of it, in the ""My Little Shido 2"" game
that Maria was managing, Kurumi was a classmate.)"""	
Message	None	"(Does that mean, this environment's been replicated?
I don't know...)"	
Message	Shido	...Come to think of it, where's Maria?	
Message	Kurumi	Maria-san? She's over there.	
Message	Tohka	Hnrgh... Origami Tobiichi... Is that true?	
Message	Origami	"I'm sure of it. That Rinne Sonogami is a threat. With
her return, there's a large chance that Shido's time
and energy will be jeopardized."	
Message	Origami	"So it's not wise to leave Rinne Sonogami as is.
Tohka Yatogami, you should also set up a trap."	
Message	Tohka	"B-But, Rinne is also a precious friend of mine! I can't
betray her...!"	
Message	Maria	"You two, please stop. Doing that will only lower your
dignity."	
Message	Tohka	...What? Lower my dignity?	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Dismissing others in order to fulfill your own
desires is not respectable in the general sense.
People may even hate you because of it."	
Message	Tohka	What?! Grrrr... You set me up!	
Message	Origami	"I just offered the best idea in response to a threat.
Whether or not you take action or not is up to you."	
Message	Tohka	"You...! I won't let you get away with this, Origami
Tobiichi!"	
Message	Maria	N-No! It's almost time for class, please stay calm...	
Message	Shido	Haha...	
Message	None	"(I couldn't help but laugh. Maria was in the classroom
as if it were completely normal, and she's having fun.
Up until now, I thought it would've been impossible.)"	
Message	Ai	"Itsuka-kun, why are you laughing all by yourself so
early in the morning? It's kinda creepy..."	
Message	Mai	"I bet you anything he's thinking of a girl he's
abducted!"	
Message	Mii	We must report him to the police immediately!	
Message	Shido	"No, I was just laughing. But for you to say that much
about me is a bit messed up!"	
Message	Tonomachi	It's how you live your daily life, you bastard!	
Message	Tonomachi	"Tohka-chan, Tobiichi-san, Rinne-chan... The Yamai
Sisters from next door, and now a homestay girl?!
You pervert! Super pervert!"	
Message	Shido	What are you doing in my class, anyway?!	
Message	None	(Why does our class have so many annoying people...)	
Message	Rinne	Shido, you're so popular.	
Message	Kurumi	Yup. He is everyone's Shido.	
Message	Shido	That sounds so wrong?!	
Message	Kurumi	Oh, really? Hehe.	
Message	Maria	"Shido, we're in trouble. Tohka and Origami's argument
is going off on a stupid tangent. At first it was about
Rinne, but now they're arguing over red bean paste."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I noticed. It's the usual, so don't let it bother
you."	
Message	None	"(I told Maria not to worry, and patted her head.
Rather... her saying it's a stupid tangent is pretty
messed up. Well, they really shouldn't be fighting...)"	
Message	Rinne	"Hey, Tohka-chan, Tobiichi-san. It's almost class time,
so you need to sit down."	
Message	Origami	Got it. I'll return to my seat soon.	
Message	Tohka	G-Grr... Sorry, Rinne... I'll go back to my seat, too.	
Message	Rinne	"As long as you guys understand. Come on Shido, you
need to sit down, too."	
Message	Shido	"Got it. Man, it's comforting to have you around,
Rinne."	
Message	Rinne	Huh? Oh... Um, it's not like I do much anyway.	
Message	Origami	"...Tohka Yatogami, you remember this well. This is
how Rinne Sonogami operates."	
Message	Tohka	"I see... So this is how you can get Shido to praise
you."	
Message	Maria	Amazing. Rinne is good.	
Message	Shido	"I don't know... That seems to be a weird way of putting
things, but it's true."	
Message	Maria	"Just as Tohka and Origami say, she must be one
powerful rival. I finally sense it."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you just say something, Maria?	
Message	Maria	Nothing. I was just talking to myself.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Then let's sit down then. Rinne will bring down
the hammer if we keep at it."	
Message	Maria	You're right.	
Message	None	"(Rinne's here, and so is Maria. It should have been our
first time together like this, but it feels so normal.
It was as if this was the way it's always been.)"	
Message	None	"(But something still feels strange in my heart. A world
where the two are present must surely exist. But
it's not real...)"	
Message	Tamae	Okay, everyone. Let's start homeroom...	
Message	None	"(That feeling went away as the school bell rang and
Tama-chan took her place at the front of the
classroom.)"
