Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... It was worth all this just to see everyone
have so much fun. Even Rinne and Maria looked like
they were enjoying themselves."	
Message	None	"(But, it can't be like this forever. There are so many
things we need to think about.)"	
Message	Shido	...Maybe I'll go for a walk.	
Message	Shido	"Come to think of it, when I first met her, it was
around this time."	
Message	None	"(Not much time had passed since then. But Maria is
here with me now... That's why it reminds me of her.)"	
Message	None	"(Marina, a girl who left Maria behind and
disappeared.)"	
Message	None	"(While I was remembering my time in the virtual world,
I realized I'd arrived at Takadai Park. It's late. Of
course there's no one else around but me.)"	
Message	Shido	"...I was only planning to take a stroll around the block,
but I ended up walking further than I thought."	
Message	None	"(If I take too long getting back, I might make Rinne
and Maria worry. I should hurry up and go home.)"	
Message	Shido	"Should I run...? No, I don't have to do that much.
If I just speed walk..."	
Message	None	"(Just then, I heard footsteps, even though the park
was supposedly empty.)"	
Message	None	"(I had hopes. But considering that we were in Eden,
I figured it might be a possibility.)"	
Message	???	Hm... Huh?	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	"(But when I turned around toward the voice I heard,
the person that was there was...)"	
Message	None	(An unfamiliar girl, looking bewildered and innocent.)	
Message	Shido	A... girl? At a time like this?	
Message	???	Huh...?	
Message	None	"(I couldn't explain it, but she had an undeniable
presence. And she seems a bit familiar...)"	
Message	???	Wait... Could you be Papa?	
Message	Shido	What...?	
Message	None	(P-Papa? What is this girl talking about?!)	
Message	???	You're... Papa, right?	
Message	Shido	"W-Wait a minute... I'm Shido Itsuka. I'm a high school
student. It's too soon for me to have a child your
age..."	
Message	???	Shido... Itsuka?	
Message	Shido	That's right! I'm not your papa...	
Message	???	So you are Papa! You're Papa, right?	
Message	Shido	Sh-She doesn't get it at all...	
Message	???	"No, Rio gets it. Shido Itsuka is my papa. Rio's papa's
name."	
Message	Shido	Me... Papa? Wh-What does that mean?	
Message	???	Papa is Papa, right?	
Message	Shido	No, so what "Papa" is―	
Message	???	Oh! Rio has to go soon. So I'll let you know.	
Message	Shido	Uh... Okay.	
Message	???	"For everyone to be happy, I have to find the most
important thing."	
Message	Shido	Huh? What do you mean, the most important thing?	
Message	???	Well, I'll be off! Bye-bye, Papa!	
Message	Shido	Uh, who are you...?	
Message	Rio	Rio is... Rio? Rio Sonogami!	
Message	Shido	Rio... did you say Sonogami...?!	
Message	None	(Like Rinne...?)	
Message	Rio	...Bye!	
Message	None	"(I was dumbfounded by this sudden turn of events,
and this girl named Rio ran off somewhere.)"	
Message	Shido	...W-Wait a minute! Rio! RIO!	
Message	None	"(I rushed after her, but just as I thought, she didn't
respond.)"	
Message	Shido	Who was she...	
Message	None	(Her aura was like a Spirit, and her name...)	
Message	Shido	Rio Sonogami...	
Message	None	"(Her last name was the same as Rinne's. So is she
related to Rinne in some way?)"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, she does resemble Rinne a bit.
But she called me Papa. Who was she...?)"	
Message	???	"Awww. Look at you. So glum, like your happiness just
escaped you."	
Message	Shido	Huh...?	
Message	Marina	Why are you so dumbfounded? You forgot about me?	
Message	Shido	Mari...na? Marina?! You're in this world, too...?!	
Message	Marina	"Yes. I thought I disappeared, but apparently not. My
existence here is an undeniable fact. Unfortunately
for you, you can't get rid of someone that gets in―?!"	
Message	Shido	Don't be like that... I'm so glad to see you again.	
Message	Marina	Hey, let go of me! I don't like this about you!	
Message	Shido	...Oh, sorry. I couldn't help it.	
Message	Marina	"Don't you start with me. Gosh, you're so oblivious to
what you're doing, aren't you? Someday, you'll get
arrested."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... I get that a lot.	
Message	None	(Especially from the Ai-Mai-Mii trio.)	
Message	Marina	What... So you're that happy to see me?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'm happy.	
Message	Marina	That is annoying...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What?	
Message	Marina	"Until I talked to you, you were completely in a daze.
But now, here you are, looking all serious and saying
these things to me."	
Message	Shido	Well um... I don't have any excuses, but...	
Message	Marina	"Well, I don't blame you. You met such an adorable
girl. Right, Papa?"	
Message	Shido	Marina, you saw?	
Message	Marina	"Well, yeah. I was watching the whole thing. And
besides, I know her more than you."	
Message	Shido	H-How do you know so much?	
Message	Marina	Hmm, I wonder...?	
Message	Shido	"You know what... Wait, before we go there, can you
tell me who she is...?"	
Message	Marina	"Hmm. Well, she's looking for something. She said so
herself, didn't she?"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, she did. She said... it was the most important
thing, right?"	
Message	Marina	Yes, that's right. But I can't say any more than that.	
Message	Shido	Marina, do you know something about this world?	
Message	Marina	"Hmm... I do. At least more than you do. Of course,
I'm not the type of girl who'll just give it up when
you ask."	
Message	None	"(...She hasn't changed a bit. But I found her way of
speaking nostalgic in a way.)"	
Message	Shido	"...Well, then I'm not going to ask you now. What do you
plan on doing from here?"	
Message	Marina	Me?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. It's not like you're going to come to Maria's,
right?"	
Message	Marina	Hmm... I decided to help her.	
Message	Shido	Help Rio?	
Message	Marina	"That's right. I can't just leave her be. I feel like I'm
watching over a little sister. She's such a good girl.
Unlike Maria."	
Message	Shido	I see... Isn't that nice.	
Message	Marina	"What? What are you talking about? I'm just helping
her because I'm bored."	
Message	Shido	Gosh, you really are something...	
Message	Marina	"Well, I'll be on my way. I'm sure Rio is waiting for me,
and you have to go home too, don't you?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Then, can I say one thing before we leave?	
Message	Marina	"What is it? If you ask me anything suspicious, I'll
report you to the police."	
Message	Shido	"That outfit is cute. I've never seen you in normal
clothes, so it's really new to me."	
Message	Marina	What...?! Are you an idiot?!	
Message	Shido	...That hurts?! Don't throw rocks at me!	
Message	Marina	Shut up! Gosh, when you compliment me like that....	
Message	Shido	Then what?	
Message	Marina	"Why didn't you compliment me in the beginning? And
you call yourself a ladies' man..."	
Message	Shido	I don't remember becoming one! But sorry...	
Message	None	"(I just messed up with Maria by talking about her
clothes.)"	
Message	Marina	"Gosh, I'm starting to feel... whatever. Later, Shido
Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Later, Marina.	
Message	None	"(Marina should have disappeared, but I was able to see
her again. And I have a feeling I'll see her again
sometime soon. She did say, "Later.")"	
Message	Shido	"In the end, there are so many things I can't figure
out. In fact, I feel like even more mysteries are
piling on."	
Message	None	(But I did learn one thing.)	
Message	Shido	Marina changed...	
Message	None	"(Marina is... probably the same Marina before she
disappeared. She hasn't forgotten the kindness of
saving her little sister. That made me so happy.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Welcome home, Shido. You're pretty late. Did you
walk far?"	
Message	Shido	"Rinne, you see through everything... Yeah, I started
to walk and lost track of time."	
Message	None	"(I should keep my meeting with Rio and Marina a
secret for now. I still don't know what's going on as
it is. I don't want to worry Rinne even more.)"	
Message	Rinne	...What's the matter? Did something happen?	
Message	Shido	Oh, nothing. I was just thinking.	
Message	Rinne	Wait, about this world―	
Message	Shido	No, no! It's seriously not a big deal.	
Message	Rinne	"Are you sure? You shouldn't think too hard on your
own, okay? I'll always be here to listen to you."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I know. So, where are Tohka and the others?	
Message	Rinne	"We were chatting till pretty late, but they just went
back to their houses. Kotori-chan and the others took
a bath and went to bed."	
Message	Shido	I see. Thanks for taking care of everyone, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	No problem at all. I'm going to go home now.	
Message	Shido	Okay, got it Rinne. Good night.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah. Good night, Shido... I'll see you tomorrow.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, tomorrow.	
Message	None	"(This world... A new Eden... What is it for? The same
world Rinne created, but it's not by Rinne. Maria and
Marina are here, too. This shouldn't be happening.)"	
Message	None	"(Rio... I wonder if that girl knows the secret to this
world. There's no proof, but...)"	
Message	Shido	The most important thing...	
Message	None	"(What could it be? Does it pertain to me? Or her?
I don't even know where to start.)"	
Message	Shido	If it's something important for me...	
Message	None	"(Then I thought about the little bag. I thought I saw
it recently...)"	
Message	Shido	...It can't be.	
Message	None	"(I shouldn't think too much. I'll sleep it off, clear my
head, and try again in the morning.)"	
Message	None	(And then I closed my eyes.)
