Message	None	"(This world is wrong. So I need to end it. But then―
I thought of Rio.)"	
Message	None	"(She ran all over the place to protect this world, so
everyone in this world could be happy. That was her
wish. But is such a wish from Rio... wrong?)"	
Message	None	"(This world where Rio, Rinne, Maria, and Marina exist.
Is it really okay to end it? Is there really no future
in this world?)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido...?	
Message	Shido	Rinne, I―	
Message	None	"(I didn't look at Rinne's eyes, but down at my palms.
The key is shining under the setting sun. Rinne's
most important thing. That's why this is―)"	
Message	Marina	―Fouund it!	
Message	Shido	Marina?!	
Message	Marina	"A spare key, huh... I see. It's very like Rinne
Sonogami."	
Message	Shido	Like Rinne Sonogami... What do you mean by that?	
Message	Marina	"The "most important thing" that Rio was looking for
is related to Rinne Sonogami. We were really cutting
it close, but now all the pieces have gathered."	
Message	Shido	I see... But Marina, what about you...?!	
Message	None	"(Marina asked me to erase her and move on towards
the future. But then why...?)"	
Message	Marina	"Forget about that right now. This is... even more
important. Because this is her only wish."	
Message	Rio	"Thanks for finding it, Papa. Mama's... most important
thing."	
Message	Shido	Rio?	
Message	Marina	"Go on, Shido Itsuka. Give it to her. You promised,
right? That you'd look with Rio for the most important
thing."	
Message	Shido	Well...	
Message	None	"(It's true. I did promise her. Rio, Rinne, Marina―I
couldn't have the resolve to erase them from
existence.)"	
Message	Rio	Papa... You don't like it? Do you hate this world?	
Message	Shido	"No. I don't hate it. I mean, you exist here, Rio.
And... Rinne and Marina are here, too. That makes
me... very happy."	
Message	Rio	"Then why won't you give it to me? If I have that,
then you can keep being happy, right Papa?"	
Message	Shido	I know... I know that. But it's not the right thing...	
Message	Marina	I don't think that it's not the right thing.	
Message	Rinne	Marina-san... Why?!	
Message	Marina	"Hey, Rinne Sonogami. I think it's okay... for us to
dream just a little longer."	
Message	Rinne	"But then Shido will... And Tohka-chan and the
others...?! We don't have the right... to take away
their futures! Marina-san, that's what you told me!"	
Message	Marina	"...I know. I was ready to disappear, too. But I was
with Rio today... and I wavered. I wanted to... watch
over this world that she's going to leave behind."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean, she's going to leave it behind?	
Message	Marina	"Why don't you stop just listening and think for once?
It means exactly how it sounds. Rio is Eden's power
itself. She was born just to find this thing."	
Message	Shido	Eden's power... Wait―?!	
Message	None	"(I was going to ask Marina, but I had a hunch.
About Rio's purpose and its cruel end.)"	
Message	Rinne	As Eden stabilizes, Rio-chan will disappear... Right?	
Message	Marina	"Rinne Sonogami... So you realized, huh? But it's only
natural. You were the one who was controlling that."	
Message	Rinne	"I only had a hunch. The night I held Rio-chan until
she fell asleep, I felt it. It felt familiar... That
kind of power. Rio-chan really was born from me, huh?"	
Message	Rio	Yeah. Rio was born from Mama. And Papa, too!	
Message	Shido	From me...?	
Message	Marina	"Yeah. It's really simple. Rinne Sonogami's power
as Ruler. A part of it was always inside Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Inside me... Wait?!	
Message	None	"(Marina's words made me realize... No... Maybe I was
beginning to sense it from within.)"	
Message	None	"(I have the power to seal a Spirit's spiritual powers
with a kiss. And during the last Eden, I kissed Rinne
and tried to seal her powers.)"	
Message	None	"(But Rinne, who was a crystallization of those
spiritual powers, was erased in the process.)"	
Message	None	"(Rio... A girl who calls me "Papa", and Rinne "Mama".
Those names weren't wrong at all.)"	
Message	Shido	"Rio was... born from Rinne's Spirit powers sealed
inside of me?"	
Message	Marina	"That's right. A portion of the spirit power that was
supposed to disappear with Eden was left inside of
you."	
Message	Rinne	"I think my feelings―my wish to want to be with
Shido―must have remained..."	
Message	Shido	Rinne... You...	
Message	Rinne	"You don't have to worry about me, Shido. You find
your own answer."	
Message	Shido	Okay...	
Message	None	"(Rinne's feelings. Maria's feelings. Marina's
feelings. And Rio's feelings.)"	
Message	None	"(Of course no one wants to disappear. They're all
desperately trying to suppress their feelings for
someone―for me.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked over at Rinne. Rinne looked sad, yet
happy in a way.)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne is pushing me forward. Putting herself aside.
But I―)"	
Message	Shido	"Rio! Do you want to be with me, Rinne―with all of
us?!"	
Message	Rio	"I want to! I want to be with you guys more and more!
To be honest, I wanted to play with you guys a lot!
"	
Message	Rio	But Rio―	
Message	Shido	―Then let's be together.	
Message	Rio	Pa...pa?	
Message	Shido	Come here, Rio.	
Message	None	"(Rio looked confused as she came close to me. I
softly placed the key into her hands.)"	
Message	Rio	It's okay? I thought you didn't want to, Papa.	
Message	Shido	"No. It's okay. We'll find our own form of happiness
in your world Rio. So, will you watch over us, Rio?"	
Message	Rio	"...Okay! Rio... will watch over you guys. Papa, Mama,
and everyone's happiness!"	
Message	Shido	Okay. It's a promise.	
Message	Rio	Okay. Promise!	
Message	Rinne	I see... So this is your answer, Shido?	
Message	Shido	That's right. Sorry, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"No, it's fine. I can continue to be with you, Shido...
There's a side of me that's happy about that."	
Message	Marina	Aha... So it ends this way.	
Message	Shido	Marina, you...	
Message	Marina	"You're so naïve... Seriously so naïve. Why did you
let it happen? Why did you choose this side? Then
you'll never have a future. You know that, right?"	
Message	Shido	"No, that's wrong, Marina. The more important future is
definitely this one."	
Message	Marina	The more important future...?	
Message	Shido	"Your guys' future. Marina, Rinne, and Rio's future...
It only exists here."	
Message	Marina	"You're so stupid. We never existed in the first place.
So it's only right that we disappear. "	
Message	Rinne	"But Marina-san... You said you didn't want Rio-chan's
world to disappear. That you wanted to watch over
it. I thought you wanted a future too, Marina-san."	
Message	Marina	"I think I'll disappear with Rio. So the one that will
continue to watch this world is Maria. Not... me."	
Message	Shido	Marina...	
Message	None	"(Marina was looking straight at me. She still seemed
to be wavering... It seemed that way.)"	
Message	Rinne	Hey Rio-chan. Can I do a little magic spell?	
Message	Rio	Magic spell? What's that?	
Message	Rinne	Um...	
Message	Rio	...! Okay... Okay! I think that's really good!	
Message	Rinne	"Right? I think it's really good, too. So can I ask you
to take care of it?"	
Message	Rio	"Yeah, leave it to me! Marina, come here! Papa, Mama,
let's all hold hands!"	
Message	Marina	Huh? What are you trying to do?	
Message	Rinne	Just hurry, hold her hand. Come on, Shido.	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(Huh? What were Rinne and Rio about to do?)	
Message	Rio	"Rio is going to do a magic spell with everyone, okay?
So close your eyes for a little."	
Message	Shido	Okay. So we just close our eyes?	
Message	None	"(Rio nodded. After making sure Rinne and Marina
closed their eyes, I closed mine too.)"	
Message	None	"(And there stood a world I've seen before. But
something was different. A power inside me seemed
to fade. I felt that throughout my body.)"	
Message	None	"(I tried to open my eyes, but I couldn't. That's right.
It's as if this world was reality.)"	
Message	Rio	"Thank you, Papa. It was so fun going to all these
places with you. Thank you, Mama. It felt so nice when
you held me. Rio was very, very happy."	
Message	Shido	Rio... You...	
Message	None	"(I was about to say something―but I stopped myself.
I felt myself tearing up, but I gritted my teeth and
stopped.)"	
Message	None	"(Rio has fulfilled her purpose―and she's going to
disappear. I think that was decided from the
beginning.)"	
Message	None	"(But no... because of that. As the person seeing Rio
off, I can't cry.)"	
Message	None	"(What Rio wished in her short lifespan, was nothing
more than our happiness.)"	
Message	Shido	Thank you, Rio. Thanks to you, I felt so happy.	
Message	None	(Rio smiled. Her body was gently shining.)	
Message	Rio	"And for Marina... A special for you. A gift from Rio
and Mama! It's a very wonderful magic spell."	
Message	Marina	"A gift from Rio and Rinne Sonogami...? I don't need
th―"	
Message	Rinne	"―Please accept it. I'm sure it's something you need.
It may make you sad. But even then... Your wish will
come true, Marina-san."	
Message	Marina	...Okay, fine. I'll take it, all right?	
Message	Rio	Okay! It's a very happy spell.	
Message	Marina	"...?! This power... Wait, you're going to make me the
Ruler of Eden, not Rinne Sonogami?!"	
Message	Rinne	"If you are able to take on the role of the power as
Ruler from Rio, then you can exist separately from
Maria-chan."	
Message	Rinne	"If Shido is going to choose this world, then I'm sure
everyone would be happier if there was a future for
you too, Marina-san."	
Message	Marina	"How dare you?! I never asked for this! Then I... I'll
be with Rio...!"	
Message	Rio	"Bye-bye. Thank you for being with me this whole
time. Mother, please become happy."	
Message	Marina	"...?! ...If you're going to call me that, you should
have done so from the beginning. Gosh, you're such
a mean daughter..."	
Message	Rio	Let's see each other again.	
Message	None	"(Rio disappeared, and Eden was born again. A world
without Rio, but with Marina. A secluded Eden where
people would seek happiness over and over again.)"	
Message	None	"(I am going to live in such a place. But that is my
choice. The choice that I desired.)"	
Message	None	"(I may lose the memory of this goodbye. But I thought
hard so that this would be the one thing I wouldn't
forget.)"	
Message	None	"(But I don't regret it. I feel bad for the former me
who said that there was no happiness in this world.
But I realized―)"	
Message	Shido	We can see each other again, right Rio?	
Message	None	"―I'm sure there would be a lot of happiness in this
world."
