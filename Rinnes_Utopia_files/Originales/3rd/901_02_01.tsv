Message	None	(Maria and I just left the house in our uniforms.)	
Message	None	"(...This feels so strange. To be able to walk to school
with Maria like I did back then.)"	
Message	None	"(Just as I thought that, Maria—who was swiftly walking
in front of me—suddenly turned around.)"	
Message	Maria	What's the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Oh... Nothing in particular. Uh, how do I say this...
You look like you're having fun, Maria."	
Message	Maria	"Oh... right... Maybe I was in too good of a mood.
Considering our current situation, it's proof that I'm
not being careful enough. Sorry, Shido..."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no, no. I wasn't trying to criticize you, Maria.
I think it's fine that you're like this."	
Message	Maria	...Really?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, of course. I'm happier to see you acting natural,
Maria."	
Message	Maria	I knew you'd say that.	
Message	Shido	"Does it make you happy to go to school in your
uniform?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Actually, wearing this uniform, I feel like a real
member of Raizen High School."	
Message	None	"(She's right. In the virtual world, Maria wasn't
wearing a uniform. Nobody ever questioned it, so she
didn't have to wear it, but...)"	
Message	Maria	I suppose I've made a bit of a mistake.	
Message	Shido	Haha. You don't look like you think that at all.	
Message	Maria	"Ah, you've caught on! You're really sharp, Shido.
It may be Marina's influence."	
Message	Shido	I see... Maybe...	
Message	None	"(Marina disappeared and left Maria behind. Unlike
Maria, Marina was more teasing in the manner that
she spoke.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(If Maria's here, does that mean maybe Marina's
somewhere around, too? I'm sure that Marina
disappeared back then.)"	
Message	None	"(But if it's this abnormal world, maybe... I keep getting
split seconds of hope like that. And besides―)"	
Message	Shido	.....	
Message	None	"(Besides...? Besides what? The words that came to
mind spun around in my head.)"	
Message	None	"(What was I thinking right now? If Maria's here, who
was it that would've been here, too? Wait, besides
that was―)"	
Message	Maria	Shido? You stopped walking. Is something wrong?	
Message	Shido	Oh, sorry! I―	
Message	???	Shido!	
Message	None	"(The moment that someone called for me from behind...
I felt like I knew the voice, it sounded so familiar.)"	
Message	None	"(I remember... No, I don't. I remember. No, I don't.
For some reason I had this sense that my memories
and consciousness weren't matching up.)"	
Message	???	Shido!	
Message	None	(This voice!)	
Message	None	"(Is this what it means when your mind goes blank?
I was so detached that I was conscious of it. But this
soft voice, those kind eyes... She's...)"	
Message	Shido	Rin...ne?	
Message	None	"(When I called out to her, she softly nodded in my
arms.)"	
Message	None	"(I felt myself hold onto her even more tightly. If I
squeezed too hard, would she just pass through me
like a phantom...?)"	
Message	Shido	Are you... really Rinne?	
Message	None	"(In response, I definitely felt her. A nostalgic feeling―
her warmth.)"	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... I'm Rinne... Rinne Sonogami. Shido...	
Message	None	"(The moment I acknowledged it, something inside me
overflowed. The memories of early summer. Joy,
sorrow, pain, anger―all these emotions came over me.)"	
Message	None	"(And eventually, one of them stood out over the rest.
Rinne Sonogami... a special person, my former
"childhood friend".)"	
Message	None	"(We had a sad separation, and I wasn't supposed to
be able to see her again... or so I thought.)"	
Message	Shido	I don't believe it... You're here, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"I'm thinking the exact same thing, Shido.
I'm wondering how I could be here."	
Message	Rinne	"But there's another part of me that thinks none of it
matters... Is that terrible of me?"	
Message	Shido	Not at all... I'm thinking the same thing...	
Message	Rinne	I'm so happy... You haven't changed at all, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Right back at you. You're the same old Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha... Maybe we're similar.	
Message	Shido	We are childhood friends, after all.	
Message	Rinne	...Yeah, we are childhood friends.	
Message	Tohka	Oh! Rinne! It's been a while, I was worried about you!	
Message	Kotori	"Rinne-oneechan, welcome back! So it was today that
you were coming back."	
Message	Rinne	"Tohka-chan, Kotori-chan...! It's been a while, how
have you guys been?"	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! I've been really well!	
Message	Kotori	I've been good, too! How about you, Rinne-oneechan?	
Message	Rinne	I... Hmm. I guess I missed you guys so much.	
Message	Kotori	Oh, I'm going to go call Yoshino and the others!	
Message	Tohka	Right, good idea! We will leave it to you, Kotori!	
Message	Rinne	Kotori-chan, don't run so fast! It's dangerous!	
Message	Kotori	I'm fine!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's going on...?	
Message	None	"(Everyone is totally fine with Rinne being here... Isn't
this weird?)"	
Message	Maria	She's the only one who can answer that.	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! Y-You were here...	
Message	Maria	"I see how it is. "You were here," huh... Who's the one
who ignored me, being all lovey-dovey with his
girlfriend?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, um... Maria-san? Are you upset?	
Message	Maria	I'm not upset at all. ♪	
Message	Shido	AHHHH!	
Message	None	(Sh-She's not the Maria I know!)	
Message	Rinne	"...Oh, sorry Shido. I'm supposed to be living alone,
and I guess the setting is that I've been visiting my
parents."	
Message	Shido	I see... I get it now.	
Message	None	"(Rinne came near me and whispered into my ear. I felt
like Maria was pouting even more next to me, but it
must be my imagination... Or at least, I hope it is.)"	
Message	Tohka	"Hey... Shido, Rinne. Are you guys telling each other
secrets?"	
Message	Shido	"N-Not at all, Tohka. We were talking about dinner
tonight."	
Message	Rinne	"That's right, Tohka-chan. It's been a while, so we
were discussing what kind of special food we could
prepare."	
Message	Tohka	"I see! Your cooking is amazing, Rinne! I'm getting
excited!"	
Message	Kotori	Hey, I brought them over!	
Message	Yoshino	Rinne-san... Good morning. I'm happy... you're back...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ya-hooo! It's been a while, Rinne-chaaan!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehe... Rinne. Finally you've returned from your
journey of salvation. Thanks to your efforts, it seems
as though the miasma of darkness has been lifted..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Joy. I'm glad nothing happened.	
Message	None	(Hm? Kaguya and Yuzuru―)	
Message	Miku	"Hehe. Congratulations, Rinne-san! We missed you so
much."	
Message	Rinne	Thanks, everyone. I'm happy to be back.	
Message	None	(...Miku, too? Wait could this be—)	
Message	Shido	...Is that what it means?	
Message	Rinne	"...I think so. I too have memories of spending time with
Kaguya-chan, Yuzuru-chan, and Miku-san."	
Message	None	"(Rinne answered my mutterings. I think I'm especially
happy because Rinne has naturally fit in with the rest
of the group.)"	
Message	Tohka	I know! Why don't we celebrate Rinne's return?	
Message	Miku	"Oh, that's a nice idea, Tohka-san! We should have a
party or something with a buffet...."	
Message	Shido	Buffet... Hey, we don't have that much space.	
Message	Kotori	"Then why don't we do teppanyaki? Then we can all
gather around the pan and cook!"	
Message	Maria	"I see. That seems doable. We all cook things we like
and enjoy one another's presence."	
Message	Tohka	"Oh, teppanyaki! That's a great idea. Meat, fish,
vegetables... We can cook anything, right? I'm very
excited!"	
Message	Shido	"That's true, but... I don't know if you're supposed to
just cook anything..."	
Message	Rinne	"No, I think it'll be fun for all of us to be together. We
can all bring food in, kind of like a mystery pot...? Of
course be sure to prepare things we can eat, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, good idea. Let's do that.	
Message	None	"(Well it's not like we'll use the things they bring
directly. It'll be fun.)"	
Message	Kotori	"AH! You guys are chatting too much! We'd better hurry
or else!"	
Message	Maria	"Kotori is right. If we walk too slowly, we may miss
homeroom."	
Message	Shido	Alright. Then let's head out.	
Message	Kotori	I'm that way!	
Message	Yoshino	"Oh... I'm going to go home, too. I will see everyone
later... Um, the party... I look forward to it, too."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yeah, totally, I can't wait. Yoshinon is so excited!"	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I'll see you later.	
Message	Kaguya	"Then let's go, everyone! To be late to the party would
taint the Yamai name."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. However, Yuzuru will be the first through the
gate."	
Message	Yuzuru	 Run, run, run―	
Message	Kaguya	"H-Hey, Yuzuru?! Wait a minute!
"	
Message	Kaguya	"Let us go Tohka, my kin!
We must not allow Yuzuru to be first."	
Message	Tohka	U-Understood!	
Message	Miku	Oh, you guys! Don't leave me behind!	
Message	Shido	Hey, you guys, don't―And there they go.	
Message	None	"(Hm... Wait, Miku's heading that way, too. Does that
mean she's attending Raizen High School like Maria?
Her uniform still seems to be her old one, though...)"	
Message	None	"(Well she went ahead, so there's nothing I can do.
At this rate, it'll be a lot of people.)"	
Message	Shido	"And besides, we left early. We don't have to rush too
much..."	
Message	Rinne	...I wonder if everyone was looking out.	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say something?	
Message	Rinne	...No, nothing. We should go too.	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Maria	...*Stare*.	
Message	None	"(Maria is staring at me. That's right, this is the only
time I can check with Rinne about what's going on
without Tohka and the others noticing.)"	
Message	Shido	...Rinne, can I ask you one thing?	
Message	Rinne	...I don't know.	
Message	Shido	What...?!	
Message	Rinne	"You want to ask me about this, right? A world where
there's no way I would exist... Is this place Eden...?"	
Message	None	(I gulped. She nailed it. I was about to ask that.)	
Message	None	"(Maria doesn't have a body. Rinne, who should have
disappeared. And a fake memory implanted in
everyone's minds as if there's something to hide.)"	
Message	None	(I remember this twisted world.)	
Message	None	"(That summer, Rinne activated this infinitely looping
world, Eden. Unfortunately... there's no way that this
isn't related.)"	
Message	Rinne	It's a strange feeling. I know that we're inside Eden.	
Message	Rinne	"And I recognize myself as "Rinne Sonogami". But I'm
not the Ruler of this world... That, I'm sure of."	
Message	Shido	You're not the "Ruler"...?	
Message	Rinne	"Shido, you may not be able to believe me. But I have
no powers right now. I can't create an ideal world for
you, nor can I send you back."	
Message	Rinne	"To put it frankly, I'm like an empty shell. I lost
everything, and I am all that's left."	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	"Sorry, Shido. I can't do anything for you. I'm sure
that... all of this is my fault."	
Message	Shido	"Well, we don't know that. And besides, don't say you
can't do anything for me."	
Message	Rinne	Shido...	
Message	Shido	"I'm just happy you're by my side, Rinne. I told you,
didn't I? That we can start over. Maybe now's the
time."	
Message	Rinne	...?!	
Message	Shido	"...This time, it's a promise. Although I don't know what
might happen next."	
Message	Rinne	...Thanks, Shido. I'm... so happy.	
Message	None	(I gently took Rinne's hand.)	
Message	Maria	...I see. Rinne Sonogami, I understand the situation.	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?!	
Message	None	"(I was seriously surprised... Maria had been standing
between Rinne and myself before we knew it.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Nice to meet you. I'm Rinne Sonogami. You must be...
Maria Arusu-san, right?"	
Message	Maria	Please call me Maria.	
Message	Rinne	Oh, okay. Um, can it be Maria-chan?	
Message	Maria	Yes. That is not a problem.	
Message	Rinne	"Thanks. Um, the Maria-chan in my memory is a half-
Japanese girl who lives overseas... and has come to
do a homestay here. But that's not true. Right?"	
Message	None	"(Maria looked at me for a split second. She must be
checking to see if it's okay for her to say so. I looked
her in the eyes and softly nodded.)"	
Message	Maria	"...That would be the case, I am artificial intelligence
born of the Fraxinus. Although I have a personality
similar to that of a human, I am not real."	
Message	Rinne	"I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for it to come out like
that! I'm so sorry for saying something that could
have hurt you..."	
Message	Maria	Rinne Sonogami... You're a kind person.	
Message	Rinne	"That's not true at all. But someone who's even nicer
taught me."	
Message	Maria	Is it... that person?	
Message	Rinne	"Yes. *giggle*... It's exactly who you think it is,
Maria-chan."	
Message	Maria	I see. Heh...	
Message	Shido	Um... Who are you guys talking about?	
Message	Maria	That is none of your... Well it kind of is, huh?	
Message	Rinne	"Right. It may have something to do with you, but
maybe not."	
Message	None	(That makes me even more curious...)	
Message	Maria	"Anyways, I can now deduce the situation based on your
conversation. The Angel called Eden, or someone with
similar powers, may be the key to this phenomenon."	
Message	Shido	"You're right, Maria. That's very likely. I feel like it's
similar to your case, but..."	
Message	Maria	"No. I know for certain that this isn't virtual reality.
However, it's true that we are in an abnormal situation.
In order to resolve it, we need more information."	
Message	None	"(But what can we do to resolve it? I don't even know
what that is. Not that it's a good enough reason to do
nothing.)"	
Message	Shido	"But... When you say gather information, what do you
mean?"	
Message	Maria	"First, we're going to have to live our normal lives. We
need to see what's going on in the world. Of course,
within a range that doesn't disturb our daily lives."	
Message	Shido	"I see... You have a point. It wouldn't be the first time
we used this approach. There were hints about what
was going on in our daily lives."	
Message	Maria	"Right. As we continue to live our lives here, we should
be able to catch on to the intention behind all this.
Someone may contact us like Marina did."	
Message	Rinne	"Right. I agree with Maria-chan. I have a feeling that
you'll be the one who'll find the answer, Shido."	
Message	Maria	What a coincidence. I agree with you, Rinne Sonogami.	
Message	Rinne	"*Giggle*... You too, huh Maria-chan? Oh... Call me
Rinne, Maria-chan. It feels too formal, you know?"	
Message	Maria	Understood. Then I will call you Rinne from now on.	
Message	Rinne	Okay! It's a pleasure, Maria-chan.	
Message	Maria	The pleasure is mine, Rinne.	
Message	None	"(Seeing them call each other by name made me tear up
a bit. The two who should have disappeared have met,
and can now be friends. It really feels like a dream.)"	
Message	Shido	.....	
Message	None	"(Suddenly I felt a pang of pain in my heart. If Eden is
a fake world like the other one, someday it will
disappear.)"
