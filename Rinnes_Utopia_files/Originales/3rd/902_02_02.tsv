Message	Shido	I just started walking like usual, but...	
Message	None	"(Having the walk be over as soon as we reach home...
We can't just do that.)"	
Message	Rio	Hey, Papa?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it, Rio?	
Message	Rio	Someone is following us.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Origami	What's the matter?	
Message	Shido	...?! I thought I heard Origami. Haha... It can't be.	
Message	Rio	Can't it? Behind you.	
Message	Shido	Behind... me?	
Message	None	(I turned around and there was no one there.)	
Message	Shido	...Ahh, don't scare me.	
Message	Origami	What a coincidence to see you here.	
Message	Shido	H-H-H-H-Hey?! O-Origami?! What are you doing here...	
Message	Origami	"I was taking a stroll with you on my mind, when I
bumped into you by coincidence. A fateful encounter."	
Message	Shido	No, no, that's definitely reaching...	
Message	Rio	Hey, Papa? Is she Origami Tobiichi?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Rio. Can you hold on a minute...	
Message	Origami	"Is she involved with you, Shido? I am Origami
Tobiichi. I'm like Shido's wife."	
Message	Shido	"No, she's Tonomachi's relative. Hey wait... Don't tell
her absurd things."	
Message	Origami	Absurd? I don't know what you're talking about.	
Message	Shido	Oh, come on...	
Message	Rio	Papa. Did you get married to Tobiichi-san?	
Message	Shido	NO! We're not like that!	
Message	Rio	Then another kind of relationship? A lover?	
Message	Origami	That's right. We have yet to submit the documents.	
Message	Shido	"I told you we're not like that! A classmate, she's my
classmate."	
Message	Rio	Yeah, I know. Ahahaha! You're so funny, Papa.	
Message	Shido	"...You know, Origami jokes a lot. Don't take her
seriously, okay Rio?"	
Message	Rio	Okay, got it! I just believe half of it, right?	
Message	Shido	I-I didn't say that, but... Yeah something like that.	
Message	Origami	"Shido, I want to ask you something. If she's
Tonomachi's relative... Why is she calling you Papa?"	
Message	Rio	Hm? Because Papa is Papa.	
Message	Shido	Ah, I guess I look like her dad.	
Message	Origami	I see. As long as she's not your true child, it's okay.	
Message	Shido	If that were to be true, that wouldn't be funny...	
Message	Origami	...What's your name?	
Message	Rio	Rio!	
Message	Origami	I see. There, there.	
Message	Rio	"Hehe. That tickles. But you're good at it, Tobiichi-
san!"	
Message	Origami	Thank you. How do you know my name?	
Message	Rio	Papa kinda told me.	
Message	Origami	Shido, I am touched by your love.	
Message	None	"(What is up with this combination... I'm getting tired
of dealing with them...)"	
Message	None	"(We went to the park and played on the swings until
the sun set.)"	
Message	Rio	Rio has to go soon.	
Message	Shido	Oh, is it time to see Marina?	
Message	Rio	Yeah. I promised her.	
Message	Shido	I see. Did you have fun?	
Message	Rio	Yes. I had a lot of fun.	
Message	Shido	Okay, good.	
Message	Rio	Well... Bye, Papa, Tobiichi-san.	
Message	Origami	I want a child like you with Shido.	
Message	Shido	Hey Origami... Give her an appropriate goodbye.	
Message	Origami	Bye-bye Rio.	
Message	Shido	Later, Rio.	
Message	Rio	Okay. Bye, you two!	
Message	None	"(...Hey wait. I had something to ask Marina and I totally
forgot. Oh well, next time I see her―)"	
Message	Rio	I forgot to tell you something, Papa.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Rio	If you're going to visit today... Park, okay?	
Message	None	(Rio whispered into my ear.)	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Rio	Bye-bye!	
Message	Origami	Shido, what did Rio say?	
Message	Shido	...Thanks for today. I guess she was shy?	
Message	None	(I couldn't tell her what Rio told me.)	
Message	Origami	I see. I can't believe she's related to Tonomachi.	
Message	Shido	I know. Totally not alike.	
Message	None	(Well probably because they're not related.)	
Message	Origami	"Shido, be careful... I have a feeling she'll eventually
become one strong enemy."	
Message	Shido	What's that supposed to mean?	
Message	None	(I gave Origami a wry smile.)
