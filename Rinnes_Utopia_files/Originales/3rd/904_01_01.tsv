Message	Shido	Mm...	
Message	None	(Hey, I'm not... in my room.)	
Message	Shido	Um... Where am I...?!	
Message	Rinne	"...Mm....mmm....
...Zzz..."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(I immediately sat up and my brain started to wake
up―That's right... I slept in Rinne's room with Rio...
but where's... Rio?)"	
Message	Shido	...Where did Rio go?	
Message	None	"(It was just Rinne and me in the bed... That's not
good.)"	
Message	None	"(...Maybe I can go home while she's sleeping. I'm
sure Kotori isn't back yet... And Maria may know
where Rio went.)"	
Message	Rinne	...Mm... Shido... is...it... delicious...?	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Rinne... I'll see you later.	
Message	Rinne	Mmm... okay... zzz...	
Message	None	"(I couldn't tell if Rinne responded or not, but she
started to breathe steadily again.)"	
Message	None	(I need to hurry home. I feel a bit awkward...)	
Message	Shido	Phew. The morning sun feels nice.	
Message	None	"(After changing in the living room, I stood outside
and stretched. And then I turned around.)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne's house felt like she was living there. In
other words... it was no longer a place where Rinne
just spent her downtime.)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne was born again in this world, and she's living
her normal life. That made me a bit happy.)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne isn't a Spirit. Reine-san told me after Eden
ended.)"	
Message	None	"(A fake world with fake settings. Rinne was the
manager. And her existence wasn't real.)"	
Message	None	"(I've been looking at Rinne until today and I thought
about something. Rinne probably wants the real thing.)"	
Message	None	"(A bond with everyone after you spend time together.
Just like Rinne said herself the other day.)"	
Message	None	"(The cooking class yesterday was also the same.
Rinne wasn't doing it for me, but for herself.)"	
Message	None	"(But this will all end soon. According to Rio and
Marina, it could be tomorrow... or even today. The
time is definitely nearing.)"	
Message	None	(So...)	
Message	Shido	I have to make a decision.	
Message	None	(I put a hand over my heart, as if to promise myself.)	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Shido... You sure seem to be home early.	
Message	Shido	K-Kotori?! Why are you up this early?	
Message	Kotori	"*Yawn*... I just got home a bit ago, too. You didn't
look like you weren't coming in at all. So I was just
waiting for you."	
Message	Shido	Ah... I see. Sorry for keeping you.	
Message	Kotori	"Forget about that. Shido, you're stressed about
something, aren't you? You've been acting weird the
past few days."	
Message	Shido	...Gosh, you really are something.	
Message	Kotori	Well, we are family you know? So, what happened?	
Message	Shido	"Sorry, Kotori. I... can't say anything this time. There's
something I need to do."	
Message	Kotori	It's about Rinne, isn't it? Or is it Maria?	
Message	Shido	...?! Kotori, do you know everything already...?	
Message	Kotori	"No... But I know that much. I mean, when you look at
them, there are times when you're looking off into
the distance. It's kind of like you're... the old you."	
Message	Shido	I see... I suck at hiding things, huh?	
Message	Kotori	You do. But I'm not going to ask you right now.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"I told you, I'm going to let you do what you want.
An adorable little sister's role is to push you from
behind when you need it, right?"	
Message	Shido	...Thanks.	
Message	Kotori	"Hehe... But you owe me one. I'm sure Tohka and the
others aren't up yet, so I'm going to go sleep a bit
longer. You do what you need to."	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Kotori.	
Message	Kotori	Hang in there, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	Right.	
Message	None	"(I can't have Kotori support me while I just stand
there doing nothing. I will find an answer―today.)"	
Message	None	"(I looked all over the house, but I couldn't find Rio
or Maria. She should have been home.)"	
Message	None	"(Eden is coming to an end. Maybe Rio―and Marina
helping her―are in a rush.)"	
Message	Shido	.....	
Message	None	"(I took out the small bag in my drawer. Inside was a
spare key. A spare key I handed to Rinne in the last
Eden.)"	
Message	None	(And... what Rinne left to me.)	
Message	None	"(Once the normal days returned, that feeling of loss
struck pain in my heart once again. It's as if it were
screaming so I wouldn't forget.)"	
Message	Shido	But I have to go.	
Message	None	(I came here to do everything I've come to do.)	
Message	Shido	...She's awake by now, right?	
Message	None	"(It's past 10. It's not like we were up especially late,
so Rinne should be up by now...)"	
Message	Rinne	Who is it...	
Message	Rinne	 Huh? Shido? Oh, did you forget something?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no... It's not that. Rinne, do you have some free
time today?"	
Message	Rinne	"I don't have anything to do in particular... What's
the matter? I woke up and both you and Rio-chan
were gone, so I was a little surprised."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, sorry. I thought I'd try to get home before
Kotori got back."	
Message	None	"(However, she was standing like a gladiator at the
entrance.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, I see. Sorry, I didn't think about that. So,
where's Rio-chan?"	
Message	Shido	"When I got home, Maria wasn't home. So I think
they're together..."	
Message	Rinne	I see... I'm a little worried.	
Message	Shido	"It's fine. Maria and Marina are by her side. I'm sure
they're just taking a stroll together."	
Message	Rinne	"I see. You're right. So what about you, Shido?
If it's not about Rio-chan, what did you need to talk
to me about?"	
Message	Shido	"Right. It's not a big deal, but would you come with
me?"	
Message	Rinne	"Sure. You want to go shopping, right? I'll go with
you. Since it's morning, should we go to the station―"	
Message	Shido	―Let's go on a date, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"...Excuse me? Sorry, Shido. I couldn't hear you.
Can you say it again?"	
Message	Shido	"We're going on a date, Rinne. We didn't finish the
last one."	
Message	Rinne	"Date... with me? Are you serious? You don't have to
feel sorry for me..."	
Message	Shido	"No. I want to go on a date with you, Rinne. So come
with me."	
Message	Rinne	"...Haha. That's not fair, Shido. If you're going to
put it that way... how can I say no?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I know I'm not fair. Did you not know that
already?"	
Message	Rinne	"No. I know all too well... That's what I like about
you."	
Message	Shido	"...*Grunt*. Th-Thanks. So will you get ready? I'll be
waiting here."	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Then give me a bit more time okay, darling?	
Message	Shido	What?! Wh-Where did that come from?	
Message	Rinne	I just copied Miku-san. Anyways, be right back.	
Message	Shido	Gosh... Rinne.	
Message	None	(As I said it, I could feel myself smiling.)	
Message	Shido	I... I like that part of you, too.	
Message	None	"(I knew she couldn't hear me, but I just wanted to
say it anyway.)"
