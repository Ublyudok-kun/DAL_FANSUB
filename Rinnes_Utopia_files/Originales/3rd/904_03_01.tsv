Message	None	"(This world is wrong. This is a world that has
stopped. A world that can't move into the future.)"	
Message	None	"(I knew all of that from the beginning. But in this
moment, I remembered Rinne.)"	
Message	None	"(But then, Rio and Marina appeared. There was an
existence that wanted to continue in this life, and I
think I got confused.)"	
Message	None	"(Whether my days with Rinne or a future without her
were correct, I didn't know. I spent my days like this
until finally I had an answer.)"	
Message	Shido	Rinne... I've decided.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. I'll trust whatever you're going to choose.	
Message	None	(I don't need this anymore.)	
Message	Shido	...I'll carry on the burden. You... Marina, and Rio.	
Message	Rinne	"It's okay, Shido. That's the correct answer. Your true
happiness... isn't here."	
Message	None	"(I looked at the key shining in the sunset and tried to
grip it―)"	
Message	Shido	―?!	
Message	Rinne	Shido?!	
Message	Marina	―Mine.	
Message	Shido	Marina?!	
Message	Marina	So it was this, huh? Man, that's kind of a surprise.	
Message	Marina	"Rio thought it'd be where Rinne Sonogami's memories
were, but it's only natural that it'd be where Shido
Itsuka was. I guess Rio's just a child, after all."	
Message	Shido	Marina... Why did you...?	
Message	None	"(Marina said to move toward the future and let her
disappear. So then, why...?)"	
Message	Marina	"Well, I didn't really want to do this, but she asked
me to. Sorry, Shido."	
Message	Shido	Rio...	
Message	Rio	"Thanks, Marina. Thanks to you, Papa... I found it.
The most important thing!"	
Message	None	"(Marina softly placed the key on top of Rio's palm.
Rio hugged the key as if it were something precious.)"	
Message	Rio	"Now everyone can be happy. Everyone can be really,
really happy!"	
Message	Shido	No, Rio... This world shouldn't go on.	
Message	Rio	"Why not? I mean at this rate, you'll be sad. Right,
Papa? You won't get to see Mama anymore. Maria-
onechan and Marina will disappear, too."	
Message	Shido	...But even then, it's still not right.	
Message	Rio	"But here, you can have everything. You can have
a happy dream, live a happy life. It'll have a happy
beginning and a happy ending."	
Message	None	"(I feel like I've heard this kind of tempting offer
before.)"	
Message	None	"(It reminds me of the girl who once appeared as an
enemy.)"	
Message	Rinne	Shido... Do you think Rio-chan is...	
Message	Shido	"I see, Rio... You're Rinne from that moment―
You're the Ruler herself. That's why you're trying to
continue Eden, isn't it?"	
Message	Rio	"No. Rio is Rio. Rio just wants everyone to be happy.
That's all. If Papa and Mama are happy, that's even
better!"	
Message	Shido	"Rio. Even if you continue this world, I won't be
happy."	
Message	Rio	"Why won't you be? Won't you be happy because you get
to be with Mama?"	
Message	Shido	"No, Rio, that's not it. You don't understand. To
continue this world... Do you know how lonely it is
to repeat it over and over?"	
Message	Rio	"Lonely? Rio ill be happy, as long as everyone is
here. And besides... Rio's world won't break like
Mama's."	
Message	None	"(Rio's words caused Rinne to look down. The last
Eden was destroyed because of Rinne's emotional
wavering.)"	
Message	None	"(But it was going well at first. There's no guarantee
that it wouldn't happen again.)"	
Message	Shido	"That may be true for now. But that day will eventually
come."	
Message	Rio	When will it come?	
Message	Shido	Well...	
Message	None	"(I had no words. How many times would we have to
go through this for her to reach Rinne's level...?
No, Rinne wouldn't know, either.)"	
Message	Rio	See? It's okay, right?	
Message	Marina	You really are honest, Rio.	
Message	Rio	Marina? What's the matter?	
Message	Marina	"I can't do it. Even if I know what you want, and I
want to help you―I can't accept this."	
Message	Rio	Mari...na?	
Message	Marina	"You're hiding something, aren't you Rio? The fact that
you'll disappear regardless."	
Message	Shido	"Rio... will disappear even if I choose this world?
Wh-What do you mean?!"	
Message	Rinne	...I knew it.	
Message	Shido	Rinne? What do you mean, you knew it?	
Message	Rinne	"...I felt it the night I held Rio-chan until she fell
asleep. It felt very nostalgic... That kind of power.
Rio-chan, you must have really been born from me."	
Message	Rio	Yeah. Rio was born from Mama. And Papa, too!	
Message	Shido	From me...?	
Message	Marina	"Yeah. It's really simple. Rinne Sonogami's power
as Ruler. A part of it was always inside Shido Itsuka."	
Message	Shido	Inside me... Wait?!	
Message	None	"(Marina's words made me realize... No... Maybe I was
beginning to sense it from within.)"	
Message	None	"(I have the power to seal a Spirit's spiritual powers
with a kiss. And during the last Eden, I kissed Rinne
and tried to seal her powers.)"	
Message	None	"(But Rinne, who was a crystallization of those
spiritual powers, was erased in the process.)"	
Message	None	"(Rio... A girl who calls me "Papa", and Rinne "Mama".
Those names weren't wrong at all.)"	
Message	Shido	"Rio was... born from Rinne's Spirit powers sealed
inside of me?"	
Message	Marina	"That's right. And Rio had a will until now, to find
"the most important thing". But from beyond this
point, you don't need her right?"	
Message	Marina	"Even if Eden disappears and becomes complete, Rio
Sonogami doesn't have a future."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Rio	"Everyone's happiness is more important to Rio.
That's why it's fine."	
Message	Shido	I...	
Message	None	"(Rio was willing to sacrifice herself to continue this
Eden.)"	
Message	None	"(Even if she disappears, she wanted everyone to be
happy. That's all she wished for.)"	
Message	Marina	"Shido Itsuka. Don't waver over something you've
already decided. If you give up, Rio will continue this
Eden. You're a man, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	...I know. I know it. But―	
Message	Marina	That's why people tell you you're too nice.	
Message	None	(...I, I don't want to―)	
Message	Rinne	No, Rio-chan.	
Message	Rio	Huh...? Mama...?	
Message	Rinne	"You... must have worked so hard without understanding
what you were doing... So that emotion... must be my
curse."	
Message	Rio	I don't get it?	
Message	Rinne	"I'm sorry. But I want you to listen to me. You really
are my daughter, aren't you? And my emotions put
you through pain."	
Message	Rinne	"You see, I don't want to disappear, either. I want to
be by Shido's side. I want him to say he loves me.
I want him to hold me. I want him... to remember me."	
Message	Rinne	"But even then, I've made up my mind. I'm going to
see Shido off. Because all of this is me being
selfish."	
Message	Rio	Mama... You're going to say bye to Papa?	
Message	Rinne	"Yes I will, Rio-chan. Or else, true happiness won't
come."	
Message	Rio	Is there such a thing as true in happiness?	
Message	Rinne	There is. See, like this.	
Message	None	(Rinne hugged Rio. Rio leaned in comfortably.)	
Message	Rinne	Rio-chan. Are you happy to be with Mama?	
Message	Rio	"Yeah. It's so warm to be in your arms... It makes me
happy."	
Message	Rinne	"See? It's a lot easier than you think to be happy,
right?"	
Message	Rio	Yeah... it is easy.	
Message	Rinne	So we never needed Eden from the beginning.	
Message	Rio	"But then Mama, your happiness will be gone. Don't you
want to be happy?"	
Message	Rinne	"Thank you for thinking of me, Rio-chan. But I'll be
fine. Thanks to you, I was able to see Shido again,
and I felt so much happiness. How about you, Rio-chan?"	
Message	Rio	Rio... was also very happy.	
Message	Rinne	"See? Happiness is always nearby. So we need to give
it back to them. The happiness that everyone is going
to find on their own, in their futures."	
Message	Rio	"I understand now, Mama. I can feel it from you. From
the sound of your heartbeat."	
Message	Rio	Mama... you must really love Papa. The same as Rio!	
Message	Rinne	"The same? I don't know... I think I love Shido more
than you do, Rio-chan."	
Message	Rio	Nuh-uh! Rio loves Papa more! Right, Papa?!	
Message	Shido	Rio... Yeah. I love you too, Rio.	
Message	Rio	"Papa... Rio knows now. True happiness is different.
I have to return everyone."	
Message	Shido	Rio... I...	
Message	Rio	"Rio was happy to be with you, Papa. The family
restaurant, the sleepover, all of it was so, so fun!"	
Message	Shido	"I had so much fun, too. I wanted to be with you for
longer. But I'm so sorry. For being such a bad papa."	
Message	Rio	No, you're really nice, Papa. Rio is so happy.	
Message	Shido	Rio... Thank you. I was happy, too.	
Message	Rio	Hehe... Please be a lot, lot, lot more happy okay?	
Message	Shido	"Got it. Leave it to me. I'll become so happy that it's
way too much."	
Message	Rio	Oh, and Marina!	
Message	Marina	"What do you want, Rio? I have no plan on getting in
the way of family time."	
Message	Rio	Thanks for being with me all this time, Mother.	
Message	Marina	―?! Rio!	
Message	Rio	Mama, please.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Leave the rest to Mama.	
Message	None	"(And then Rio returned inside Rinne. Naturally, as if
she was returning to her original place.)"	
Message	Rinne	Thank you... Rio.	
Message	Marina	Rio's gone, huh... Then I guess that ends my role.	
Message	Shido	Marina... Aren't you happy?	
Message	Marina	"What? I have no idea what you're talking about. Don't
look at me."	
Message	Shido	You know...	
Message	None	(She doesn't have to act tough at a time like this.)	
Message	Marina	"Guess this is farewell for us. Thanks for the nice
dream... Shido."	
Message	Maria	Marina...	
Message	Shido	Marina, don't tell me you...	
Message	Maria	"No, I think she really doesn't want you to see her
face. Marina is Miss Crybaby."	
Message	Shido	If she hears you, she'll be so mad.	
Message	Maria	It's fine. I think she understands.	
Message	Shido	She has an adorable side to her, doesn't she?	
Message	Maria	"Hehe. She actually has a lot of these moments.
My One-san, that is."	
Message	Shido	I'll remember that side of her, too.	
Message	Maria	Yes, please do. Now then, I'll be on my way.	
Message	Shido	Way... Where are you going?	
Message	Maria	"For a walk of course. I'm going with Marina. I want to
see this town for as long as possible. Now, now,
Shido... There's someone waiting for you."	
Message	None	(And Maria lightly pushed my back.)	
Message	Shido	Maria...?	
Message	Maria	"Please spend time with her in the end. Goodbye,
Shido. Next time, I will see you through a screen."	
Message	None	"(And then Maria just walked off. The only ones left
were me... and Rinne.)"	
Message	Shido	Everyone's gone.	
Message	Rinne	"...Yeah. I can return you anytime, Shido. Rio-chan is
back, but the power of Eden is inside me."	
Message	Shido	I see... Rio did disappear, then.	
Message	Rinne	That's not it. Rio-chan is here.	
Message	None	(And Rinne placed her hand over her heart.)	
Message	Rinne	―And the rest is here.	
Message	None	(And then she placed her hand over my heart.)	
Message	Shido	Ah... I see. You're right.	
Message	None	(The time I spent with Rio was etched into my heart.)	
Message	Rinne	"Shido... I'm going to close Eden. So I have to say
goodbye."	
Message	Shido	"Right... It is time for goodbye. Come to think of it,
I wasn't able to say goodbye to you the last time."	
Message	Rinne	"You're right. I just said all I wanted to say and made
you cry."	
Message	Shido	How do you know that...? That I cried?	
Message	Rinne	Well... That's a secret. Secrets are a girl's specialty.	
Message	Shido	"I see... Well, I don't let it bother me. I mean, it's
you we're talking about."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe. It's between you and me, right?	
Message	Shido	Haha. Right. Between you and me.	
Message	Rinne	Ahahaha. Hey Shido...? Can I ask you one last thing?	
Message	Shido	Sure. If it's something I can do, anything.	
Message	Rinne	You shouldn't say something like that.	
Message	Shido	Well, but―	
Message	None	"(Something flowed... It smelled sweet. Before I knew
it, Rinne's face was right in front of me―and she put
her lips on mine.)"	
Message	Rinne	You said anything, so I did it.	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Rinne	"Last time, you kissed me. So this time... it's from me.
Did I make your heart pound?"	
Message	Shido	"You always make my heart pound. In a lot of different
ways."	
Message	Rinne	"Now I'm satisfied. I really was happy. Because the me
that disappeared... thought that I would never see you
again."	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I forgot... about you. I thought I decided that I
would never forget you..."	
Message	Rinne	"It's okay. It can't be helped. But this time... just a
little magic."	
Message	None	"(And what Rinne offered was the spare key that
Marina took from me. But there was something I
didn't add―a pretty pink flower key holder.)"	
Message	Shido	This key... And this key holder... Did you...?	
Message	Rinne	"Yup. I put it on when you were talking to Maria-chan
earlier. Isn't it cute?"	
Message	Shido	Yes, it's cute. What... kind of flower is this?	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... It's a secret.	
Message	Shido	What the heck? You could tell me, you know.	
Message	Rinne	"Nope. Or will you not take it unless you know the
name?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, of course I will. I'll take good care of it. I
promise."	
Message	Rinne	"It would be nice if you could use it instead of your
current key. So that even if you forget me, you can
remember me someday."	
Message	Shido	Okay, I will. Thanks, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	"No, I'm the one that should be thanking you. Thank
you for all the memories, Shido... I think it's almost
time."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... It's time to say goodbye.	
Message	Rinne	"Don't look so sad. The end... I want you to see me
off with a smile. I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere."	
Message	Shido	You're right. I'm sure we'll meet again.	
Message	None	"(Rinne and I must be connected somehow. So I'll
remember her again. And we'll meet again. I'm sure
we can meet again someday.)"	
Message	Shido	This time, I'm going to say it. Goodbye... Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Okay. Goodbye, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Rinn―	
Message	None	"(I reached out for Rinne, who was crying on the
inside―)"	
Message	None	"(―And the moment I was about to touch her hand, I
grabbed air.)"	
Message	Shido	...I promise.	
Message	None	"(After my second goodbye, what was left to me was
the same spare key as last time.)"	
Message	Shido	No, it's not the same. Right, Rinne?	
Message	None	"(And I shook the flower key holder on the key. It felt
like it was responding, and I thought it flashed.)"	
Message	None	(Hmm... Not here either, huh?)	
Message	Shido	Then is it in my room?	
Message	None	"(I entered my room and remembered for a split
second. The spare key that Kotori gave me before.
It should be inside my drawer.)"	
Message	None	"(―There it is. The small bag at the back of the
drawer. A design that looks kind of girly at first
glance.)"	
Message	Shido	This, huh? Uh...	
Message	None	"(I took it out of the bag, and unlike the simple one
I used, this one had a pink flower holder. Maybe I
put it on so I wouldn't lose it. I don't remember.)"	
Message	Shido	But just one...	
Message	None	"(I can't just give the spare to one person. Maybe I
should make a few.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, I'll change my key to this one. I might as well.
And it's easy to tell, anyways. So I'll just use it."	
Message	None	"(So I swapped the key with the one I had and put it
into the bag. The simple one with no design went
back into the bag and I closed the drawer.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Shido? Everyone's almost here...
"	
Message	Kotori	Hey, what are you doing?	
Message	Shido	Hm? Oh Kotori. Sorry. I'll head over.	
Message	Kotori	"Hmm... What's that? A "Forget-Me-Not" key holder?
That sure is cute."	
Message	Shido	Forget-Me-Not? Is that the name of the flower?	
Message	Kotori	"What? You put it on without knowing? It's Scorpion
grass. A flower that blooms in the spring. It means
"forget me not". And it also means "true love"."	
Message	Shido	.....	
Message	None	"(I wonder why. The moment I heard those words, I felt
my heart pound.)"	
Message	Kotori	What's up with your face?	
Message	Shido	Oh... Nothing.	
Message	Kotori	"Really? Whatever. Anyways, I'm going to go ahead of
you."	
Message	Shido	"Forget me not"... and "true love" huh...	
Message	None	"(This design may not be particularly manly, but for
some reason... it felt so natural to me. It's as if it
were something made for me.)"	
Message	Shido	Good to know you.	
Message	None	"(I said that to the key. It felt weird, but this is going
to be my long-time companion. I have to make a good
impression.)"	
Message	None	Yeah. Good to know you, too.	
Message	None	"(For a second, I felt like I heard someone's voice.
It felt nostalgic. Melancholic. A voice that would
make me feel that way.)"	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	None	(I knew it was weird, but I answered.)
