Message	Shido	All right, we came to the shopping district, but...	
Message	None	"(It's hard to decide where to go when you don't really
have a purpose. I guess we can buy some drinks
somewhere...)"	
Message	Rio	Hey, Papa?	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it, Rio?	
Message	Rio	"There's someone staring over there. She has a lot of
odangos. She must eat a lot."	
Message	Shido	"A person that's eating a lot looking this way?
...Oh, no!"	
Message	Shido	Tohka?!	
Message	Tohka	"I knew it was you, Shido! I was wondering about it,
but you were with someone I didn't know, so I wasn't
sure if I should call out to you."	
Message	Shido	Ah I see. What a coincidence.	
Message	Tohka	I know. Anyways, who is that girl, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh, she's...	
Message	Rio	...Eat. Is Rio going to be eaten?	
Message	Shido	"...No, no. Tohka does eat a lot, but she won't eat
you, so don't worry."	
Message	Rio	...Really?	
Message	Shido	Really. There's no one that eats people.	
Message	Rio	Huh? Rio knows someone? Tokisa―	
Message	Shido	"STOP! Please I don't want to be cursed, so don't
say any more!"	
Message	Rio	Really? If you say so, Papa. Okay.	
Message	Shido	Thanks. So, um... she's Rio.	
Message	Tohka	Rio. That's a nice name! It's similar to Rinne's name.	
Message	Rio	Yeah. Rinne is Rio's Ma―	
Message	Shido	Sh-She's Tonomachi's relative. I'm looking after her.	
Message	Tohka	Tonomachi's? They don't look alike at all.	
Message	Shido	"Well, that happens with relatives. Anyways, what were
you doing?"	
Message	Tohka	"Oh. It smelled good today, so I dropped by the dango
store. See look. It's freshly made and it looks so
good!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, it does look good.	
Message	None	(All right. I was able to dodge that one...)	
Message	Rio	Papa. Is she... Tohka Yatogami?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. So Rio, don't call me Papa in front of her...	
Message	Rio	Why? Papa is Papa, right?	
Message	Shido	There's a time and a place for things...	
Message	Tohka	Shido... Why is Rio calling you Papa?	
Message	Shido	Oh... I guess she likes hanging out with me.	
Message	Tohka	"Well, you are very likeable. So you're playing dad for
now, huh? That must be nice, Shido."	
Message	Rio	Yeah, Papa is nice! He's super-duper nice.	
Message	Tohka	Right. Rio you're right, Shido is very nice.	
Message	Rio	Tohka-chan, you eat a lot!	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*?!	
Message	Rio	But that's what makes you great.	
Message	Tohka	Y-Yes...	
Message	Rio	"Then do you want to go on a walk with us too,
Tohka-chan?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's a great idea. Once you're done with the
dango, do you want to take a stroll with us, Tohka?"	
Message	Tohka	Okay. Then I must eat it. Do you want to try one?	
Message	Rio	I can? Don't you like to eat a lot, Tohka-chan?	
Message	Tohka	It's fine. I have one more. No need to be shy.	
Message	Rio	"Okay. Thank you, Tohka-chan. *Nom*... *nom, nom*...
Yummy!"	
Message	Tohka	Right?! Isobeyaki is just one of my favorites.	
Message	Rio	Are there others?	
Message	Tohka	Yeah. My very favorite is the one with kinako.	
Message	Rio	Oh, that sounds good.	
Message	Tohka	Do you want to try it?	
Message	Rio	Yeah. Tohka-chan, you're nice. Just like Papa.	
Message	Tohka	Hehe, right?! I don't eat a lot, I'm just nice!	
Message	Rio	If you don't say stuff like that.	
Message	Tohka	*Grunt*...?!	
Message	Shido	Hehe... Ahaha...	
Message	Tohka	What's so funny, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Nothing.	
Message	None	"(I'm not going to tell her that it's hard to tell which
one of them is older.)"	
Message	None	(Evening fell as we walked around with Tohka.)	
Message	Rio	Rio has to go soon.	
Message	Shido	Oh, is it time to see Marina?	
Message	Rio	Yeah. I promised her.	
Message	Shido	I see. Did you have fun?	
Message	Rio	Yes. I had a lot of fun.	
Message	Tohka	Okay, good.	
Message	Rio	Well... Bye, Papa, Tohka-chan.	
Message	Tohka	Okay, see you later Rio!	
Message	Shido	Bye, Rio.	
Message	None	"(...Hey wait. I had something to ask Marina and I totally
forgot. Oh well, next time I see her―)"	
Message	Rio	I forgot to tell you something, Papa.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Rio	If you're going to visit today... Park, okay?	
Message	None	(Rio whispered into my ear.)	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Rio	Bye-bye!	
Message	Tohka	I couldn't hear... What did Rio say to you?	
Message	Shido	...Thanks for today. I guess she was shy.	
Message	None	(I couldn't tell her what Rio told me.)	
Message	Tohka	Hehe, I see. Rio was very cute.	
Message	None	(I nodded with a smile.)
