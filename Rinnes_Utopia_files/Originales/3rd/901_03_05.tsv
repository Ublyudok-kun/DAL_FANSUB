Message	None	"(After classes were finished for the day, I wrapped up
my after-school duties.)"	
Message	Shido	"I have to cook dinner, so I guess I'll drop by the
market before going home."	
Message	None	"(Oh, but if Rinne went before me, then we might
double-up on groceries. I could give her a call to
check.)"	
Message	Shido	...She hung up?	
Message	None	(Hm. I wonder if she's inside the market already?)	
Message	Rinne	Hey, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"Rinne?! Were you waiting for me? Sorry for keeping
you."	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, don't worry about it. I just decided to wait on my
own. I figured we should go together. And I was talking
the whole time, so I wasn't bored at all."	
Message	Shido	Talking? Is someone waiting with you?	
Message	???	BAH!	
Message	Shido	AH?! Wha-What—?!	
Message	Maria	Shido, you are quite theatrical.	
Message	Shido	"...Oh, it's you, Maria. Were you the one talking with
Rinne?"	
Message	Maria	Yes, that was me. I was sharing information with her.	
Message	Shido	Sharing information...?	
Message	Rinne	I asked her what happened while I was gone.	
Message	Maria	And I also asked about Rinne.	
Message	Shido	I see. You two sure got close.	
Message	None	"(Rinne doesn't know anything that's happened
recently. Maria doesn't know Rinne. I guess they'd
have a lot to talk about.)"	
Message	None	"(I feel a little emotional because I never thought
there'd come a day where the two would be laughing
with one another.)"	
Message	Maria	I'm sensing a fatherly gaze from Shido.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah, it feels that way. Although our eyes are
meeting, it looks like you're seeing something far
away..."	
Message	Shido	"N-No, no. It's not like that. I just finished up, so
let's hurry and go to the market."	
Message	Maria	"...I am unsatisfied with that answer, but sure. We
also must consider the time required to prepare
dinner."	
Message	Rinne	"Then Shido, you have to hurry up and get ready to go
home."	
Message	Shido	Oh, hang on a bit.	
Message	Maria	"It feels like just the other day, but I'm already so
nostalgic."	
Message	None	"(Maria walked merrily in front of me and was happily
looking around her.)"	
Message	Shido	You look like you're having fun, Maria.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I never imagined that I could walk through this
town on my own two feet again."	
Message	Shido	"But don't do anything dangerous, okay? There are
cars here, you know."	
Message	Maria	"You don't need to tell me that. Shido, you are so
overprotective."	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... You two are like brother and sister.	
Message	Maria	Rinne. Please take back that statement.	
Message	Rinne	Huh?	
Message	Maria	"I am not a little sister to Shido. I will never be.
Right, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	O-Oh... Yeah, I guess.	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, we had a similar conversation
before. I remember she pouted because I didn't treat
her like a girl.)"	
Message	Maria	"A little sister can be precious, but can never become
a girlfriend."	
Message	Rinne	"I see... Maria-chan, you want to become Shido's
girlfriend, huh?"	
Message	Maria	Yes. Shido and I have already kissed.	
Message	Shido	Hey! Maria-san?!	
Message	None	(It's true, but her statement can be misleading.)	
Message	Rinne	Hehe... Then I'm rooting for you, Maria-chan.	
Message	Maria	Rinne, are you...?! 	
Message	Rinne	The old me would have said that.	
Message	Maria	Huh?	
Message	Rinne	"But sorry. I can't get myself to say that right now...
I want to be with Shido, too. I want to be the most
important person to him. Even if it's just a dream."	
Message	None	"(Her words felt like nails being driven inside me. I
should have known about Rinne's feelings. And how
she's not good at expressing herself...)"	
Message	Rinne	"So I can't give him to you... No, not to Tohka-chan,
Tobiichi-san... No one. I don't want to give him up.
That's how I feel."	
Message	Rinne	Hahah... I wonder why.	
Message	Rinne	"Before, I used to think that as long as Shido was
happy, I was fine... I really thought that. How weird.
I... I feel like I'm not my usual self."	
Message	Maria	You're not weird.	
Message	Rinne	Huh...?	
Message	Maria	"Of course it's not weird. It's only natural you want
to be with the person you love. That is what "love"
is."	
Message	Rinne	Maria-chan...	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah... You must be right. It has to be...
I want to be by Shido's side."	
Message	Rinne	"Haha... I wonder why I wasn't able to say such a
simple thing all this time. Why... did it take me
so long?"	
Message	Shido	Rinne...	
Message	Maria	"Now that you've realized your feelings, we are now
officially rivals, Rinne.
"	
Message	Maria	I won't lose to you or the others.	
Message	Rinne	Yeah... I won't lose, either.	
Message	Maria	Okay. Hehe.	
Message	Rinne	Sure. Ahaha.	
Message	None	"(The two looked at one another and started to laugh.
The heavy air from earlier was gone, and it seems like
they're back to their usual selves.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. Then let's head to the market.	
Message	Rinne	.....	
Message	Maria	.....	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's wrong, you two?	
Message	Maria	Let's go, Rinne.	
Message	Rinne	Sure, let's go.	
Message	Shido	H-Hey! What's up with you guys?!	
Message	None	(Did I say something?)	
Message	Rinne	"Come to think of it, I think you're almost out of soy
sauce, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you're right. I think we'll use a lot of it today, so
why don't we buy two big ones..."	
Message	Maria	"If you want soy sauce, then we're going to have to
go over there. If you're not particular on brands, the
light value seems cheaper."	
Message	Rinne	"Maria-chan, can I have you bring the Cookman? It's a
bit expensive, but Shido usually buys it."	
Message	Maria	Is that true?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. Well, we do buy other brands from time to time,
but I do often buy Cookman."	
Message	Maria	"I see... I'm sorry, Shido. I never had to think about
this before."	
Message	Shido	"It's not like I'm particular, though. The taste of your
dishes can change when you change the soy sauce
brand, so I do like to change brands sometimes."	
Message	Maria	"I see. I was able to learn more things about you,
Shido."	
Message	Shido	It's not that big of a deal.	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah, Maria-chan. If you cook at Shido's place,
you'll come to learn these things."	
Message	Maria	"I feel like I just lost, hearing you tell me this,
Rinne."	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh, it's not like that. This soy sauce is fine. So
what's left...?"	
Message	Maria	It may be good to purchase fruits.	
Message	Shido	"Ah, you have a point. I'm starting to get tired of
baking dessert."	
Message	None	"(When we first entered the market, both Rinne and
Maria seemed to be in a bad mood but as we
discussed what to make, things returned to normal.)"	
Message	None	"(Seems like there's still a hint of rivalry, but that much
is something my heart can handle, so I'm happy.)"	
Message	Maria	"A fruity vegetable would be tomato. It's often used as
a dessert, too. Additionally, the color component
lycopene has various health benefits."	
Message	Shido	Well, that sounds good. Let's buy some tomatoes.	
Message	Rinne	"Wait a minute. Peaches are on sale. What do you
think? Although it may be a bit off-season, it still
looks really good."	
Message	Shido	"Peaches, huh? It's true that we don't usually have
them at home. You want to go with that?"	
Message	Maria	"But as Rinne stated earlier, peaches are in season
during the summer. I can say that this time, there
will not be much flavor to them. I suggest tomatoes."	
Message	Shido	"Well you have a point. It's probably on sale because
it's off-season. Hmm, now I'm not sure."	
Message	Rinne	"I understand where Maria-chan is coming from, but I
think Tohka-chan would enjoy sweet peaches rather
than tomatoes."	
Message	Maria	"Rinne, there are also plum tomatoes. You can enjoy
the sweetness as if it's a fruit."	
Message	Rinne	"But a plum tomato is pretty pricey, right? I don't
think there's a need to buy something so expensive."	
Message	Maria	"Shido likes to try new things, so I don't see a
problem with it. I don't think he's ever had a plum
tomato before. Right, Shido?"	
Message	Shido	"Yes, that's true, but... It's not like I want to force
myself to eat it―"	
Message	Maria	Hm...	
Message	None	(I sense a sharp gaze...)	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess it's worth trying.	
Message	Maria	Right. I knew you'd say that, Shido.	
Message	Rinne	"But Shido is also very frugal. See? Look Shido, this
is half the usual price. It's a good deal."	
Message	Shido	"It's true it may be a good deal, but you don't have to
be so gung-ho over the peaches..."	
Message	Rinne	...Hm?	
Message	None	(I sense a strong sense of pressure from Rinne...)	
Message	Shido	"Well, I guess when it's on sale, it'd be a shame not to
buy it."	
Message	Rinne	Right? I mean, you're a good shopper like I am, Shido.	
Message	Maria	Hmmm.	
Message	Rinne	Hehe...	
Message	None	(Why does it feel so cold suddenly...)	
Message	Shido	"Hey, you two, it's not like it has to be either-or, so
why don't we buy both?"	
Message	Rinne & Marina	Oh...	
Message	None	"(We finished grocery shopping and headed home.
Maria and Rinne had two bags and I had four. We
ended up buying a lot of things.)"	
Message	Shido	But... we sure bought a lot. Can we eat all of this?	
Message	Rinne	"Well we have a lot of big eaters, so I'm sure we'll be
fine. If you're worried, do you want to call
Tonomachi-kun over?"	
Message	Shido	"No, we don't have to call him. If we did, he'd be
really annoying..."	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha... If he heard that, he'd cry.	
Message	Shido	"Let him cry. Well, if we have any leftover
ingredients, we can think of the menu for tomorrow."	
Message	Maria	"Then I will think up of the ultimate recipe. I suppose
I can consider a variety of choices so that I can be
ready for any ingredients to be left."	
Message	Rinne	Then let me help. Let's think about it together.	
Message	Maria	Right. If you're with me, I'll feel more at ease.	
Message	Shido	Seems like I don't need to be here.	
Message	Rinne	Probably not.	
Message	Maria	I agree.	
Message	Shido	Y-You guys don't have to be that direct...	
Message	None	"(It's as if I'm in the way. Sometimes these two are
competing, and other times they're close. I feel like
it's odder than Tohka's and Origami's relationship.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Well if Maria-chan and I are here, then you won't have
to worry about cooking."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. We can prepare an even more delicious meal than
you, Shido."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that may be true but I'm starting to lose my
position..."	
Message	Maria	"Hehe... Now don't look like a lost puppy, Shido. We're
not saying this to be mean."	
Message	Rinne	"You see, when you were paying earlier, Maria-chan
and I were talking. So we decided that we're going to
help you."	
Message	Shido	Help... me?	
Message	Maria	"Yes, assistance to live in this world. Shido, you have
the tendency to ball up everything on your own..."	
Message	Rinne	"We can't get you out of this world currently. But...
That's more of a reason that I want to do everything
I can."	
Message	Shido	You guys...	
Message	Maria	"Other than us, no one else has realized that
something is off. So you can rely on us more."	
Message	Rinne	"Yeah. It's painful for us to see you always stressed
out."	
Message	Shido	"....Oh. Thanks. I'll depend on you guys when the time
comes."	
Message	None	(With that, I started to walk faster.)	
Message	Maria	...Shido, what's the matter?	
Message	Rinne	Maybe he felt a bit embarrassed?	
Message	None	"(Rinne's voice from behind wasn't off. I was a bit shy
about it. But something else was on my mind.)"	
Message	None	"(I've ended Eden once. Same goes for Maria's virtual
reality world.)"	
Message	None	"(This dream, the fake scenery of non-reality. Is this
a dream that I have to wake up from?)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne said before that we should feel happiness in
this world. The me of the past would have immediately
said... "That's wrong.")"	
Message	None	"(But now, there's a side of me that doesn't think that
way anymore. I'm starting to think that there may be
another way.)"	
Message	None	"(...I'm going to keep this to myself. I'm not ready
yet.)"
