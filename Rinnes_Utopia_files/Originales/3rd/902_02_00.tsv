Message	None	"(In the end, I ended up going to the rooftop by
myself. I wanted to gather my thoughts about what
to do next.)"	
Message	None	"(Just as I was thinking this morning, I think the
biggest goal is for me to find Rio. That's the
least I can do for now.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess I'll have to go back to Takadai...	
Message	None	"(Rather than letting things happen, I needed to take
action. It's way better than doing nothing at all.)"	
Message	Shido	All right. I'm going to head over.	
Message	None	"(Because I killed some time on the rooftop, everyone
else had already gone home.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, not everyone has memories of the past, so I'll
go on my own to keep from stressing them out. But if
they find out, I have a feeling they'll be mad... Hm?)"	
Message	Shido	Is that...?!	
Message	Rio	...Papa!	
Message	Shido	Whoa! So you are the girl from yesterday...	
Message	Rio	Not just some girl. I'm Rio.	
Message	Shido	O-Oh, right... Rio. So what are you doing here?	
Message	Rio	I wanted to see you, Papa!	
Message	Shido	M-Me...? Oh, perfect. I wanted to see you, too.	
Message	Rio	Hehe... I'm so happy! Same as Paaapaaa ♪	
Message	None	"(Well, it's true that I wanted to see her. I never
imagined that she'd be the one to find me.)"	
Message	Shido	Marina isn't with you today?	
Message	Rio	Marina? Marina visits me when it gets dark outside!	
Message	Shido	I see. She's a nice girl.	
Message	Rio	Yeah, Marina's nice! She stays with Rio!	
Message	Shido	That's nice.	
Message	None	"(Seems like Marina and Rio get along. I wonder why
it's only at night? I'm sure she's protecting Rio, but
there's no reason to be gone in the daytime...)"	
Message	Rio	"But if I'm with you Papa... I think it's more fun! So I
came to invite you."	
Message	Shido	Invite me?	
Message	Rio	"Yes, invite! Papa, will you help me look for
something?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, you mentioned it yesterday...	
Message	Rio	"Yeah! The most important thing! Rio has to find it
here."	
Message	Shido	You have to find it here...	
Message	None	"(If that has to do with Eden, it may be the base point
for the barrier like last time. But that's only if...
this girl is related to Rinne somehow.)"	
Message	None	(I have to ask her if she's involved.)	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rio?	
Message	Rio	What, what, Papa?	
Message	Shido	Why do you call me Papa?	
Message	Rio	Why? Shido Itsuka is Rio's Papa. Papa is Papa.	
Message	Shido	Hmm, I see... I guess.	
Message	None	"(Her answer was so vague that I couldn't help but
sigh. My question still hasn't been answered.)"	
Message	Rio	What's the matter, Papa? Are you tired?	
Message	Shido	Oh, no, it's nothing. Can I ask you one more thing?	
Message	Rio	Sure. If Papa's going to help me!	
Message	Shido	Uh... okay. Only today, all right?	
Message	Rio	Okay!	
Message	Shido	So I want to ask you, Rio... Are you Rin―	
Message	Student A	Hey, isn't that Itsuka the sophomore?	
Message	Student B	"He's with a little girl. He was rumored to be a
pedophile... Could it be...?"	
Message	Student C	That's crazy!	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Rio. Can we take a walk?	
Message	Rio	Okay, got it.	
Message	None	"(If we stay here, more annoying rumors could spread...
It's best that we get out of here.)"	
Message	Shido	"Okay, we got pretty far, so I think we're good now.
So Rio, I wanted to ask you..."	
Message	Rio	Okay.	
Message	Shido	Do you have anything to do with Rinne?	
Message	Rio	Rinne? You mean... Rinne... Sonogami?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah that's it. Rinne Sonogami. She has the same last
name as―"	
Message	Rio	I wanna see her!	
Message	Shido	You wanna see her...? Rinne?	
Message	Rio	Oh... but I don't want to see her.	
Message	Shido	Which is it... So you do know Rinne?	
Message	Rio	"Yeah I know her. I know her just as much as I know
you Papa."	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	Rio	Rinne Sonogami is Mama. Rio's mama.	
Message	Shido	M-Mama...?	
Message	Rio	"Yup, Mama! Because I was able to see Papa, now I
want to see Mama."	
Message	None	"(Rio's statement made my brain stop. I'm Papa... and
Rinne's Mama? What is going on?)"	
Message	None	"(Rinne and I aren't like that, and Rio looks like
she's in grade school. If that's the case, then that
means I did stuff when I was in elementary school...)"	
Message	Rio	"Rio wanted to go see Mama too. But Marina said I
can't. Rio is a good girl and keeping that promise."	
Message	Shido	I see... You really are a good girl, Rio.	
Message	None	"(I softly patted her head. Rio looked happy and leaned
into me.)"	
Message	None	"(Rio is a child. There are many times when it's hard
to communicate with her.)"	
Message	None	"(From what Rio said, Marina seems to know what's
going on. It's best we kill some time and see Marina.)"	
Message	Shido	"There's still time before Marina comes, right? Then
why don't we go take a stroll?"	
Message	Rio	"Yeah! Strollliinnngg wittth Paaapaaa! Wiiiith Paaapaa!
Stroooll!"	
Message	Shido	Hahaha... Rio, you're so energetic.	
Message	Rio	Yeah. Papa, you said that kids are best energetic.	
Message	Shido	"Did I say that in front of you, Rio? Oh well. Then
let's head out."
