Message	Shido	Oh, Mana? Out shopping?	
Message	Mana	Hey, Onii-sama! Yes, I am! What about you?	
Message	Shido	I was just passing by. What are you buying?	
Message	Mana	"Oh. Some instant foods. I saw a sale, so I
thought I would stock up."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, I see. Don't you get bored of eating
that stuff after a while? Let me make
you dinner sometime."	
Message	Mana	"Are you freaking serious?! I can't wait to
eat your cooking!"	
Message	None	"(Mana smiled from ear to ear, as if she
was an ordinary girl. This was as good of
a time as any to ask.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, yeah. Mana, what's the most important
thing to you?"	
Message	Mana	"The most important thing, huh? I've never
freaking thought about it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, it's hard to say...	
Message	Mana	"Well, if I could pick one thing, it might be you.
You're my only family."	
Message	Shido	I see. Thanks, Mana. You mean a lot to me, too.	
Message	Mana	"Yeah! You're always on my mind!
"	
Message	Mana	Oh. The sale's about to start.	
Message	Shido	Ah, I see. Sorry for stopping you. Go ahead.	
Message	Mana	"Okay! Hehehe... I'm freaking stoked I got to
talk to you like this."	
Message	Shido	Right...	
Message	None	"(Family's the most important thing, huh?
She makes a good point.)"
