Message	Shido	"There are barely any people here. Well, I have Rio
with me, so I guess that's lucky."	
Message	None	"(It wouldn't be great if someone ended up reporting
me to the authorities.)"	
Message	Rio	Papa, how far are we going to walk?	
Message	Shido	"Hm... Why don't we check this place out a bit, then
head over to Takadai. There aren't too many people
there."	
Message	Rio	Okay! Then Papa, please show me the way, okay?	
Message	Shido	Leave it to me, Princess.	
Message	Rio	Do you think Rio is a princess?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. You're as adorable as a princess, so you are a
princess."	
Message	Rio	Like how Papa's Papa?	
Message	Shido	It's a little different, but... Yeah, kind of like that.	
Message	Rio	Heeey.	
Message	Shido	...Huh? Rio, where are you?!	
Message	None	(Did something happen...?!)	
Message	Kaguya	Hehe. I've captured the princess, Shido!	
Message	Rio	She captured me.	
Message	Shido	Kaguya?! What the... What are you doing?	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph. Hearing you say she's a princess... I'm not
going to keep quiet about it. The princess's blood
shall resurrect my true powers―"	
Message	Kaguya	"*Cough*?! What, how dare you hurt me in this
manner... Who are you?"	
Message	Kurumi	"Gosh. You've gone too far, involving a child in your
antics."	
Message	Kaguya	Kurumi?! You dare get in my way?!	
Message	Shido	K-Kurumi... What are you doing here?	
Message	Kurumi	"It seemed like Kaguya-san was playing around, so I
came to rescue you. Is that a problem?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, I don't know exactly what's going on, but... I
guess you saved us?"	
Message	Rio	Oh? I don't know.	
Message	Kaguya	"*Grunt*... How dare you get in the way of my holy
ritual... I was just planning to have some fun with
her..."	
Message	Kurumi	"Your definition of fun is unsettling. You need to
study a bit more."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph. So... My servant Shido. Who is that? Is she
really your pretty, pretty princess?"	
Message	Shido	"What is up with that name... She's Rio. Uh...
Tonomachi's relative."	
Message	Kaguya	"I see, I get it now! So the last hope that your eternal
friend has left you! That is her true nature, is it?"	
Message	Shido	Uh, what do you mean by true nature?	
Message	None	"(She's not really related to him, and Tonomachi isn't
my eternal friend.)"	
Message	Rio	Hmm... Rio is a pretty, pretty princess?	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, you are a very adorable princess.	
Message	Rio	Hehe... Thank you for saying nice things, Kurumin.	
Message	Kurumi	Hauu?!	
Message	Shido	Wh-What the?! Kurumi is acting odd...	
Message	Kurumi	You really are adorable. What is your name, nya?	
Message	Kaguya	Nya? I just felt shivers down my spine...	
Message	Kurumi	Wh-What is your name?	
Message	Rio	I'm Rio, Kurumin.	
Message	Kurumi	"Then Rio-san, please tell me one thing. Why are you
calling me Kurumin?"	
Message	Rio	Kurumin is Kurumin, right? A pretty kitty, right?	
Message	Kurumi	I don't quite understand, but my heart hurts.	
Message	Kaguya	"It's so rare to see Kurumi being attacked one-sided.
Hehe... I've witnessed something interesting today."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Yeah.	
Message	None	"(I think Rio heard from Marina what happened in the
virtual world. That's why it makes sense that Kurumi
wouldn't remember.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Anyways, small child―Do you know my name?	
Message	Rio	Kaguya-chan.	
Message	Kaguya	Grr... That's not it―my true name!	
Message	Rio	Hmm... Ka-chan?	
Message	Kaguya	I'm not at that age!	
Message	Kurumi	Hm... Hehehehe.	
Message	Shido	Pfft... Hahahahahaha!	
Message	None	"(I guess both Kurumi and I couldn't handle Rio's
sudden statement.)"	
Message	None	"(After that, Kurumi hugged Rio, and Kaguya and Rio
played pretend... Before we knew it, it was evening.)"	
Message	Rio	Rio has to go soon.	
Message	Shido	Oh, is it time to see Marina?	
Message	Rio	Yeah. I promised her.	
Message	Shido	I see. Did you have fun?	
Message	Rio	Yes. I had a lot of fun.	
Message	Shido	Okay, good.	
Message	Rio	Well... Bye, Papa, Kurumin, Kaguya-chan.	
Message	Kurumi	Yes, I am satisfied.	
Message	Kaguya	"Be careful when saying my name in front
of other people, Rio, my underling."	
Message	Rio	"Okay, Kaguya-chan. I'll be sure to not call you Ka-
chan."	
Message	Kaguya	Like I said—!	
Message	Shido	Haha... Kaguya, say goodbye.	
Message	Kaguya	Okay. Later, Rio.	
Message	Shido	Later, Rio.	
Message	Rio	Okay! Later! Goodbye!	
Message	None	"(...Hey wait. I had something to ask Marina and I totally
forgot. Oh well, next time I see her―)"	
Message	Rio	I forgot to tell you something, Papa.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Rio	If you're going to visit today... Park, okay?	
Message	None	(Rio whispered into my ear.)	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Rio	Bye-bye!	
Message	Kurumi	My, a secret with Shido-san?	
Message	Shido	"No... She just said thanks for today. I'm glad she had
fun."	
Message	None	(I couldn't tell her what Rio told me.)	
Message	Kurumi	"Right. Though I feel like there was one bad influence
here."	
Message	Kaguya	Hey, are you talking about me?!	
Message	Kurumi	"Oh, so you knew. It doesn't look like you feel bad
about it at all."	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph. You're of a similar breed, so you shouldn't be
talking!"	
Message	Kurumi	A-A similar breed? To... whom?	
Message	Kaguya	To me.	
Message	Kurumi	"What... He...hehehee... Seems like we played too much.
I'm going to excuse myself now."	
Message	Kaguya	Huh? She's gone already?	
Message	Shido	Oh, Kurumi must have been shocked.	
Message	None	(I couldn't help but give a wry smile.)
