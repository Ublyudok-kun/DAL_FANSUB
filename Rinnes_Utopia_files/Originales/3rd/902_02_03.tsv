Message	Shido	"Okay, so we're at the station... What should we do
now?"	
Message	Rio	Did you not have anything in mind, Papa?	
Message	Shido	"Well I thought there'd be more stuff to look at versus
from the shopping district. Maybe we can walk
around..."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, isn't that Shido-kun? Are you on a date without\nYoshino? Is this some kind of date?"	
Message	None	(That voice...)	
Message	Yoshino	Shido-san... What a coincidence.	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino and Yoshinon! What a coincidence. I'm
surprised to see you two here at the station. What's
the matter?"	
Message	Yoshino	Well, um...	
Message	Kotori	Sorry Yoshino. It was crowded.	
Message	Kotori	" What? Shido?!
What are you doing here?"	
Message	Shido	Oh, um...	
Message	Rio	"Papa, that's Yoshino-chan and Kotori-chan right?
Are we playing together?"	
Message	Yoshino	Sh-Shido-san... That child...	
Message	Kotori	Did you... abduct her?!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Aw, maaan. You finally did it, didn't ya Shido-kun...\nWeren't you satisfied with Yoshino-chan and Kotori-\nchan?	
Message	Shido	Who the hell do you guys think I am...	
Message	Kotori	I mean, it's Shido...	
Message	Yoshinon	"It is Shido-kun..."	
Message	Yoshino	Yes...	
Message	Shido	How little faith do you guys have in me?!	
Message	Rio	"Papa, they have faith in you. Everyone's saying the
same things about you."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, but it's in the wrong direction!	
Message	Kotori	"So, who is she? You're making her call you Papa...
Are you sure you didn't kidnap her?"	
Message	Shido	Of course not! She's, um...	
Message	Rio	Rio is Tonomachi-kun's relative.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	What... Is that true?!	
Message	Yoshino	Wow...	
Message	Yoshinon	"What a surprise!"	
Message	Rio	Right, Papa?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. The teacher needed to speak with Tonomachi
after class, so I'm with her until that's done."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Seriously, you're surrounded by all kinds of
girls, Shido."	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hmmm. Anyways, Shido-kun. Yoshino says she's\nwondering about something."	
Message	Shido	Yoshino? What is it?	
Message	Yoshino	Why is that girl calling you... Papa?	
Message	Shido	O-Oh about that...	
Message	Rio	"Papa is like my Papa, so he's Papa. Anyone like Papa
I can call papa."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... Is that so?	
Message	Shido	Haha... I guess so.	
Message	Kotori	Papa, eh? You look so happy about that... Pathetic.	
Message	Shido	Hey... There's probably a better way to express that.	
Message	Kotori	"It's fine. It's just you, Shido. Anyways, what's her
name?"	
Message	Rio	Rio is Rio! Nice to see you, Kotori-chan.	
Message	Kotori	"Yes, nice to see you too. I was going to introduce
myself... but it seems like you already know me."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I guess Tonomachi talks about us a lot.	
Message	Kotori	"What? That's amazing. You just listen to him, and you
can figure things out."	
Message	Shido	"That's true. I mean, it must be her first time seeing
you guys."	
Message	Rio	Hey, Yoshino-chan. This rabbit is cute.	
Message	Yoshino	Um... Rio-san... She isn't a rabbit...	
Message	Yoshinon	"That's right! Yoshinon has... an awesome name. Yoshinon!"	
Message	Rio	Hmm... Yoshinon?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Yup, yup! Yoshinon! You can also add a '-san' too?"	
Message	Rio	Yoshinon Rabbit-san!	
Message	Yoshinon	"LIKE I SAID... Yohinon isn't a rabbit!"	
Message	Yoshino	That's... right. Yoshinon is Yoshinon!	
Message	Rio	"Mm... Rio sees now. Yoshino and Yoshinon... So
confusing."	
Message	Yoshino	Aw...	
Message	Yoshinon	"Nooo!"	
Message	Kotori	"Jeez, what are you two doing? You're dealing with a
kid, remember? Well, I guess there's not much
difference there."	
Message	Shido	You're one to talk, no?	
Message	Kotori	Shut up. Anyways, Shido, what are you guys up to?	
Message	Shido	"Well, Rio said she's going to go back in the evening,
so we were taking a stroll to kill time. We didn't
have any particular plans."	
Message	Kotori	All right, then it's settled. Rio!	
Message	Rio	Hm? You called me?	
Message	Kotori	"Let's play together.
"	
Message	Kotori	No problem, right Shido?	
Message	Shido	S-Sure. But are you sure you guys are okay with that?	
Message	Kotori	"Absolutely. Yoshino and I were planning to anyways.
What do you say, Rio?"	
Message	Rio	Okay! Rio wants to play, too!	
Message	Kotori	"U-Um... You know, you should call me Kotori-oneesan
like the elegant girl I am. Or you can call me Onee-
sama."	
Message	Rio	Okay. Let's go, Kotori-chan.	
Message	Kotori	She's not listening... *whimper*...	
Message	Shido	Oh well, let's go.	
Message	Yoshinon	"All right. Yoshino is going to teach you what it\nmeans to be the master of hanging out!"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon... Don't say weird stuff.	
Message	None	"(And so we all hung out together. I guess this turned
out okay.)"	
Message	None	"(We had some parfait at a restaurant, then we went
to a shop to check out some trinkets, and before we
knew it, it was evening already.)"	
Message	Rio	Rio has to go soon.	
Message	Shido	Oh, is it time to see Marina?	
Message	Rio	Yeah. I promised her.	
Message	Shido	I see. Did you have fun?	
Message	Rio	Yes. I had a lot of fun.	
Message	Shido	Okay, good.	
Message	Rio	"Well... Bye Papa, Kotori-chan, Yoshino-chan, and
Yoshinon Rabbit-san!"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Like I said, it's not Rabbit-san! Oh well, whatever...\nBye-bye!"	
Message	Yoshino	That was fun. Goodbye... Rio-san.	
Message	Kotori	Bye, Rio.	
Message	Shido	Later, Rio.	
Message	Rio	Okay! Bye, everyone!	
Message	None	"(...Hey wait. I had something to ask Marina and I totally
forgot. Oh well, next time I see her―)"	
Message	Rio	I forgot to tell you something, Papa.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Rio	If you're going to visit today... Park, okay?	
Message	None	(Rio whispered into my ear.)	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Rio	Bye-bye!	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hey, Shido-kun. What did Rio-chan just say?"	
Message	Shido	"...She wants to play with everyone again. I guess she
was just shy."	
Message	None	(I couldn't tell her what Rio told me.)	
Message	Kotori	"Well if she's related to Shido's friend, I guess we
can see each other again if we want to."	
Message	Shido	Hey Kotori, Tonomachi isn't my friend.	
Message	None	(That was a messed up thing to say.)	
Message	Kotori	Shido... You're a terrible friend.	
Message	None	(I ignored her and we headed home.)
