Message	Shido	Phew, that should do it.	
Message	None	"(Phew. I didn't expect to have after-school duties
today... No one's left in the classroom but me.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I still have to get ready for dinner, but I have
time. I'll drop by the market to pick up some food.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, Rinne said she's going to be
handling it. Then I have nothing else I can think of
doing. Hm... I guess I'll just go home and help Rinne.)"	
Message	None	"(Wait a minute... Now that Rinne and Maria are here,
not to mention tomorrow's meals, Rinne won't be able
to buy everything on her own, huh?)"	
Message	Tohka	Oh, Shido! I knew it! You're still here!	
Message	Shido	Tohka? Were you waiting for me?	
Message	Tohka	Yeah! I wanted to go home with you!	
Message	Shido	Sorry, and thanks Tohka. Do you mind if I drop by the shopping district?	
Message	Tohka	"Hm? Oh, you're getting food for the teppan party
tonight? Rinne already went to get food..."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, but considering tomorrow's food too, I figured
I should pick up some more."	
Message	Tohka	"I see! Of course I'll go with you! I was just getting
hungry."	
Message	Shido	Well... we're not going to go to go eat...	
Message	Yuzuru	Question. Where do you plan on going, Shido?	
Message	Shido	"Oh, the shopping district... Whoa, Yuzuru?! Were you
on duty today, too?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. Yuzuru was also on duty. On a side note,
Kaguya made plans to go out with Yoshino, so she
has already graciously left us."	
Message	Shido	"I-I see... It must be tough for you too, Yuzuru. So
you came to check in on me, then?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Right answer. I figured I might be able to go home
with you and we could hang out."	
Message	Shido	Hang out?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Information. Currently there is a local gourmet festival
happening in the shopping district. Would you like to
swing by?"	
Message	Tohka	"Local gourmet festival? Then does that mean we get
to eat something delicious?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Indeed. There are special items and dishes from
various local regions. There are food trucks as well,
so I'm sure you'd enjoy it, Tohka."	
Message	Tohka	Whoa! That sounds great!	
Message	Shido	I see. I may be able to buy something interesting.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Wise eyes. I believe you will be bombarded with foods
you normally do not have access to."	
Message	Shido	All right. Let's swing by, then.	
Message	None	"(Rinne should be buying stuff for dinner, but if I find
something interesting, I think I'll buy it.)"	
Message	Tohka	"I wonder what kind of food trucks there are... I can't
wait!"	
Message	Shido	Hey, don't forget about dinner, okay?	
Message	Tohka	It'll be fine. I'll only just nibble.	
Message	Shido	As long as we're clear...	
Message	None	"(Well it's Tohka, I guess I don't have to worry about
her.)"	
Message	Shido	Whoa.... There are a lot of people here.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Assumption. It must be because of the gourmet
festival. However it appears that the placement of the
food truck may also be contributing to the problem."	
Message	Tohka	Oh... Shido, this place smells so good!	
Message	Shido	"Haha. I guess it's a pro of having the food truck here,
huh? Wow... There are so many kinds of food. It's
really amazing."	
Message	Tohka	"All right, then let's go check out the shop there.
I can't wait!"	
Message	Shido	"Hey, don't run, Tohka. We need to ask Yuzuru...
Wait, where is she?"	
Message	Yuzuru	Purchased. Sorry for the wait. Please eat this.	
Message	Shido	"Yuzuru?! You were just gone for a second, and you've
already bought something?!"	
Message	Shido	What are you holding?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Introducing. Yuzu juice from Shikoku. I heard it's great
for beauty too, so please try it out."	
Message	Tohka	"Yuzu? Oh, the sauce we used from the hot pot we
had the other day? Wouldn't you say it's too sour to
drink?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. I believe you're talking about yuzu ponzu.
That just uses yuzu juice in the ponzu sauce. This is
a juice with yuzu juice and water."	
Message	None	(Yuzuru brought me a cup of juice and also for Tohka.)	
Message	Shido	These cups seem interesting...	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. Supposedly all stores are using the same cup.	
Message	Shido	"I see. Well, it is a festival, so I think unity is
important."	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. Yuzuru also thinks this is fine.	
Message	Tohka	"Ah, this tastes very good! The balance between sweet
and sour is perfect!"	
Message	Shido	"...Yeah. Tohka, you're really fast when it comes to
these things."	
Message	None	"(I was impressed with Tohka and tried a sip of the
yuzu juice.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh, you're right, Tohka. The scent of yuzu is strong,
but it's really mild and easy to drink."	
Message	Tohka	Yeah. I feel energized.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analysis. The organic sours in the yuzu are best for
recovering from fatigue. It also helps with heartburn
and pains in the liver."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Addition. There's also vitamin C and flavonoids used
as antioxidants to prevent sickness. It's of the
Rutaceae branch, but is stronger than the tangerine."	
Message	Tohka	"I see... In another words, the yuzu is in the same
family as the tangerine?"	
Message	Shido	"Well, they're definitely related... Yuzuru, you sure
are knowledgeable."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. When I battled Kaguya in the past, I
researched various gourmet dishes across all regions."	
Message	Shido	"I never knew you guys had such battles... How would
you even win that kind of competition..."	
Message	Yuzuru	Satisfied. Now let's try the black oden over there.	
Message	Tohka	"Whoa! What is that?! It's different from the usual
one!"	
Message	Shido	Hey...! Wait, Tohka!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Delicious. It's different from ordinary oden. The
broth is delicious."	
Message	Tohka	You're right. This is delicious. What is this powder?	
Message	Shido	"That's broth powder. Black oden is different and
uses broth powder. It sounds delicious, doesn't it?"	
Message	Tohka	"Yeah! Oh, I know! Shido, you should try it. You'd
better eat it when it's hot."	
Message	Shido	Oh, well, I...	
Message	Tohka	Hurry up Shido. It'll be ruined if it's cold.	
Message	Shido	But that's...	
Message	None	(I'm embarrassed to do it in front of others...)	
Message	Tohka	Come on! Open your mouth! Wide! AHHH!	
Message	Shido	O-Okay...	
Message	None	(I guess I have to brace myself.)	
Message	Shido	*Nom*... *chomp, chomp*...	
Message	Tohka	What do you say? Is it good?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. The beef tendon makes the black oden so good.	
Message	Tohka	That's great. It's so nice to eat delicious food together!	
Message	Shido	Yeah.	
Message	Yuzuru	Envious. Are you favoring Tohka?	
Message	Shido	Not at all. She just gave me a piece...	
Message	Yuzuru	Questionable. Then you mean... you don't mind if I do the same.	
Message	None	(And Yuzuru offered me some too.)	
Message	Shido	Oh um... Is that how it's going to be?	
Message	Yuzuru	Request. Please open your mouth.	
Message	Shido	"It doesn't have to be the same thing though. We can
go to another stand..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Negative. Shido, you always play it off like that. I want
you to open wide right here."	
Message	None	(Yuzuru won't back down... Fine.)	
Message	Shido	Ahh...	
Message	Yuzuru	Praise. Ahh... Good job.	
Message	Shido	Mm... This is delicious!	
Message	Yuzuru	Agreed. That was the most delicious among the dishes.	
Message	Tohka	"I thought it was the most delicious, too! I wonder what
that black thing was..."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Thinking. I believe... it could be fishcake? But it feels
different..."	
Message	Shido	"It looks like it's chopped up, so it's hard to tell,
but it is fishcake. Black oden is all about the black
fishcake."	
Message	Tohka	"I see. So this is fishcake! I thought I tasted it before,
but I couldn't tell."	
Message	Shido	"They've adjusted it for mass consumption, huh?
Chopping it up like this makes the broth seep in
better. You can only taste it at a place like this."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Compared to the black oden I know, the taste
is seeping through. Now I understand why."	
Message	Shido	"Well it could have been a coincidence, but if we
attribute it to the mastery of the chef, it seems even
more delicious."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Impressive. That's amazing, Shido. You're not the head
of the household for nothing."	
Message	Shido	"Haha. Thanks. I'm glad we were able to have a nice
snack."	
Message	Tohka	Snack? That wasn't a snack, that was oden right?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Answer. Depending on the location, they serve it at
snack stands as well. Children supposedly eat black
oden as a snack."	
Message	Tohka	"Oden as a snack, that's interesting. But I'm kind of
bummed that the others aren't here, especially since
it's a rare snack."	
Message	Shido	"Then I'll try making it next time. Then we can all eat
it together."	
Message	Tohka	That sounds great!	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. I'm sure everyone will be happy.	
Message	Shido	"But we won't make it as a snack. It'll be dinner,
okay? If I serve it as a snack, I know for certain that
people won't be able to eat dinner."	
Message	Tohka	"Aww... That's unfortunate. But I can't wait to eat with
everyone!"	
Message	Yuzuru	Excited. I look forward to eating your oden, Shido.	
Message	Shido	"All right. So let's head home now. I'm sure we should
be helping out with dinner."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Halt. Wait. There's an interesting place there. Is it
okay if I check it out?"	
Message	Shido	Sure, but where are you going?	
Message	Yuzuru	Rare taste. The aroma of spices is calling me.	
Message	None	(Yuzuru, you must be affected by Tohka.)	
Message	Yuzuru	"Discovery. I was finally able to purchase it. Let's all
taste it."	
Message	None	(Yuzuru brought it over with a smile. It was...)	
Message	Shido	"Is that a curry soup ramen? It's like a ramen version
of curry udon... But the smell is different. Wait, is
this tonkotsu-based?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Affirmative. That's exactly what you said. It seems
like an unbelievable combination, but it seems to be
a dish made with passion. I was curious."	
Message	Shido	"I see. But Yuzuru... Wouldn't you say that's pretty
heavy?"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Hence why I bought one for the three of us
to share. That way, it won't affect dinner too much."	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... Well, you have a point, I guess. I guess we
can manage."	
Message	Tohka	I'm totally fine, Shido.	
Message	Shido	Amazing, Tohka...	
Message	None	"(She ate so much oden too... Actually, I wonder if I
can eat dinner after all this.)"	
Message	None	"(Before I knew it, Tohka had already put the noodles
in her mouth.)"	
Message	Tohka	Whoa. This is soooo good, Shido!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Satisfied. The combination of spices is great. Not
only for the nose, but it mesmerizes even the tongue...
It's as if I were put under a spell..."	
Message	Shido	If you put it like that I'm really curious now.	
Message	None	(I guess I can take a bite...)	
Message	Shido	...?! This is...?!	
Message	Shido	"There's a lot of lard, and the soup is pretty thick,
but that makes the umami of the curry even stronger.
The flavors compliment each other so well...!"	
Message	Shido	"And the spices. Just as Yuzuru said, this is crazy!
Curry and tonkotsu ramen... Normally you'd think the
two wouldn't go together, but I'm really surprised!"	
Message	None	(That was truly some miraculous gourmet...)	
Message	Shido	...Phew. My stomach's finally settled. Let's go home.	
Message	None	"(We threw away our cans of iced tea in the trash can
next to the vending machine, and got up from the
bench.)"	
Message	None	(The three of us devoured the curry ramen so quickly.)	
Message	Tohka	Wait, Shido. I smell something odd over there.	
Message	Shido	Hm? That area is...	
Message	None	(I looked to follow where Tohka was pointing.)	
Message	None	"(It's a flag. It looks like a flag waving in front of
the food trucks.)"	
Message	None	"(And next to the flag was a sign that read "Italian
Yakisoba".)"	
Message	Tohka	Italian... yakisoba? What is that?	
Message	Yuzuru	"Analysis. I believe it's pasta sauce on top of yakisoba.
Kind of like a westernized yakisoba. It does smell
different."	
Message	Tohka	"All right, let's go to that shop next! Let's go Shido,
Yuzuru!"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, wait! Hey, TOHKA!	
Message	None	"(And in the end, we ended up going to three additional
places.)"	
Message	None	"(Of course after eating all that, Tohka was totally
fine.)"
