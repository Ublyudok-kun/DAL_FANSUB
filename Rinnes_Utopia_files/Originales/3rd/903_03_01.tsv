Message	Shido	Mm...	
Message	None	(Hey, I'm not... in my room.)	
Message	Shido	Um... Where am I...?!	
Message	None	"(I immediately sat up and my brain started to wake
up―That's right... I slept in Rinne's room with Rio...
but where's... Rio?)"	
Message	Shido	...Where did Rio go?	
Message	None	"(It was just Rinne and me in the bed... That's not
good.)"	
Message	None	"(...Maybe I can go home while she's sleeping. I'm
sure Kotori isn't back yet... And Maria may know
where Rio went.)"	
Message	Shido	Thanks, Rinne... I'll see you later.	
Message	None	"(Rinne didn't answer me. But I felt like she gave me
a small laugh.)"	
Message	Kotori	Oh, Onii-chan, welcome home!	
Message	Shido	Oh, hey. You're home already?	
Message	Kotori	Yeah. It was so fun～	
Message	Shido	That's nice. And you're eating breakfast.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Kotori called for me and said she wanted toast
for breakfast."	
Message	Shido	"There's more than just jam here. What's up with all
these?"	
Message	Kotori	"I bought them? And now you just get veeeeeeeeerry
little."	
Message	Shido	"Veeeeery... Hey Kotori?! There's no more cash in my
wallet?! How much did you buy?!"	
Message	Kotori	Uh... Well there's crab, uni, shrimp...	
Message	Shido	It's obvious a normal household wouldn't need this!	
Message	Kotori	It's delicious. Right, Maria?	
Message	Maria	Yes. I can't believe it's toast.	
Message	Shido	Gosh, you guys...	
Message	None	(And then...)	
Message	None	"(Our ""ordinary lives"" slowly passed...)"	
Message	None	"""(And suddenly ""this world"" ended. Suddenly. Without
warning.)"""	
Message	None	"(Everything was engulfed in darkness. And I realized
that once again, I wasn't able to say goodbye.)"	
Message	Shido	Huh... What was I doing again?	
Message	None	"(As I said that, I looked around me. I was obviously
in my room. I stood in front of the desk and opened
my drawer, but...?)"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? What was I doing just now? ...Ugh. I can't
remember."	
Message	None	"(I went to go get something in my room, but I forgot
what it was... I guess that's not the first time it's
happened.)"	
Message	None	"(I got home from school and came to get something...
but I forgot. I feel like I've been in a daze for a
long time.)"	
Message	Shido	Am I... sick?	
Message	None	"(It's not like my body felt anything, so I can't really
tell.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Hey, Shido. You're here, right? Give Tohka the snack
you made the other day."	
Message	Tohka	I can't wait to try your homemade snack!	
Message	Shido	Hey, it's evening already. If you eat it now―Oh.	
Message	None	(I thought and I stopped myself. Tohka will be fine.)	
Message	Shido	Uh... Oh, I have to close the drawer. Hang on!	
Message	None	"(...I felt like I was forgetting something. I feel
like it was something really important. But I couldn't
bring myself to remember for some reason...)"
