Message	None	"(Finals were over, and it was just before summer
break. I was on my way to a school retreat with
Tohka and the girls.)"	
Message	None	"(However, our trip quickly took a turn, thanks
to the Deus Ex Machina, aka DEM Company, an
organization who's after the Spirits.)"	
Message	None	"(When we arrived to Arubi Island, I encountered
the twin Spirits, the Yamai Sisters, who could
manipulate the wind.)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hmph. What a joke. Accept me as the one and
only true Yamai Spirit."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Denial. I am the one who will survive. Kaguya,
you are unfit to carry the Yamai name."	
Message	None	"(The two were competing to be the best Yamai
with their charm. Only one problem, I was made
the judge. So whoever wooed me was the winner.)"	
Message	Kaguya	Shido. Tomorrow, I want you to choose Yuzuru.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Request. Shido, please select Kaguya as the
winner."	
Message	None	"(Deep down, each of them cared for the
other. I stressed about the dilemma, so I
decided to consult with Tohka.)"	
Message	Kaguya・Yuzuru	WHAT THE HELL?!	
Message	None	"(However, even as the two tried currying my
favor, my message got through to them. They
ended up battling until the very end.)"	
Message	None	"(Tohka and I tried to stop then, but a wizard
working under DEM, Ellen Mira Mathers, arrived to
snatch Tohka away with the Bander Snatch doll.)"	
Message	Shido	TOHKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	None	"(When Tohka was in danger, a shining sword
appeared. It was Tohka's Angel, Sandalphon.
But she wasn't able to wield it.)"	
Message	None	"(Thanks to the Fraxinus' attack on DEM's battleship,
the Bander Snatch began to malfunction, allowing
Tohka and I to get to the Yamai Sisters.)"	
Message	Shido	Please... Stop fighting!	
Message	None	"(Tohka pushed me, and I put a stop to their
battle with Sandalphon. I cried out to them
both...)"	
Message	Shido	I choose... both of you!	
Message	Shido	"Please! Trust me! Just once! Give me a chance
to save the both of you!"	
Message	Kaguya	"I don't want to die...
"	
Message	Kaguya	I want to live. I want to be with Yuzuru more.	
Message	Yuzuru	Response. Me too.	
Message	Yuzuru	" Statement. I do not wish to disappear.
I want to live with Kaguya."	
Message	None	"(Kaguya and Yuzuru made up, and I sealed
their Spirit powers. We gained a pair of new
friends who could now attend school with us.)"	
Message	None	"(By the time of the Tenou Festival, I met
my sixth Spirit.)"	
Message	Miku	"Huh? Why are you grabbing onto me? Why
haven't you fallen? Why haven't you died?"	
Message	Miku	"Back away from this stage and this world
this instant!"	
Message	None	"(The sixth Spirit, Miku Izayoi, was just like
Kotori. A former human. She hated men. As
a counter-measure, Kotori had a plan...)"	
Message	Kotori	Good luck... Onee-chan.	
Message	None	(...It involved me dressing as a girl.)	
Message	Miku	"Like I said, let's compete. Hm... Okay, fine.
During the Tenou Festival, if Raizen wins,
you can seal my Spirit. How about that?"	
Message	None	"(Miku wasn't concerned about others unless
it worked in her favor. She challenged me at
the Tenou Festival, and I accepted.)"	
Message	None	"(On the day of the festival, there was a
big stage.)"	
Message	None	"(Miku put on a dazzling performance, and then
it was my turn. However, due to an unexpected
accident, we were missing a bandmate.)"	
Message	None	"(We invited the Yamai Sisters to join our band.
Tohka's voice won us many fans, but we got 2nd
place. Miku won... or so we thought.)"	
Message	Miku	"Stop it... I-I won... I won fair and square!
They... They weren't doing their jobs!"	
Message	None	"(Miku's onstage victory was obvious. However,
for the mock store portion, Raizen took the win.
That put us ahead overall.)"	
Message	Miku	"Friendship? Bonds...? Let me prove to you that
none of that means anything to me!"	
Message	None	"(Miku was unsatisfied with the result and
activated her Angel, Gabriel.)"	
Message	None	"(Not only did she manage to brainwash the Yamai
sisters, but also Yoshino, Kotori, and many
civilians who heard her voice through the speaker.)"	
Message	None	"(Just then, Ellen intervened, once again to
capture me and Tohka. Tohka allowed me to
escape, but was captured by DEM.)"	
Message	Shido	Damn it... This isn't the time for this. I...	
Message	None	"(With my friends brainwashed, and Tohka
taken by DEM, I couldn't do anything to fight
back. But once again, she came to save the day.)"	
Message	Kurumi	"Hehehe. Looking glum. You seem to be in a
bind. Hey, Shido-san? Want to fill me in on
what's going on?"	
Message	Shido	Kurumi... Tokisaki?!	
Message	None	"(I was in a desperate situation, and there
stood the only Spirit I couldn't seal, Kurumi.)"	
Message	None	"(Kurumi said she'd lend me a hand to fulfill
her goal, so we formed a temporary truce and
headed to Miku to save Tohka.)"	
Message	Shido	"I see. Let's make a deal. Instead of me sealing
your powers, I can change them to something
else. But you have to listen to me."	
Message	Miku	"What are you talking about...? That won't
change anything―"	
Message	Shido	I want you to help me save Tohka.	
Message	None	"(With the help of Kurumi's power, I learned
about Miku's past and how to communicate
with her. I told her we needed to save Tohka.)"	
Message	None	"(We had no choice but to leave Miku behind.
Thanks to Kurumi's clone, we learned where
Tohka was being kept.)"	
Message	None	"(DEM Company's Japan branch, the first
location. That was our destination.)"	
Message	Kotori	Now, it's time.	
Message	Shido	That's right.	
Message	Kotori	Let's start our date.	
Message	Shido	Let's start our date.	
Message	None	"(Kurumi told me she had another mission, so we
parted ways. Mana claimed to leave DEM, and Kotori,
freed from Miku's control, helped me save Tohka.)"	
Message	Miku	Hmph. How pathetic. Gabriel... SOLO!	
Message	None	"(As I headed to Tohka, I felt ready to faint.
But it was Miku who saved me.)"	
Message	Shido	What? Miku... You remembered your promise?	
Message	Miku	Don't get me mistaken, okay?	
Message	Miku	"I toooootally don't care at all about someone
who spreads hate!"	
Message	Miku	"I came here because I wanted to add another
Spirit into my collection."	
Message	Shido	Thanks!	
Message	None	"(Miku then told me herself about her past.
She suffered a trauma as an idol that made
her lose her voice. She was so confused...)"	
Message	Shido	"Spirit powers don't matter. Even if you
lose your voice, that doesn't mean you're
worthless!"	
Message	Miku	What... I don't believe you!	
Message	Miku	" Every fan who said so never believed me!
When I went through hard times...
No one was there for me!"	
Message	Shido	"I don't agree! I'm sure there are fans who
believe in you and are waiting for you! But
if what you said was true, I'll be there for you!"	
Message	None	"(As I made this vow to Miku, we reached the
final door. Beyond it... was Tohka.)"	
Message	Shido	"I am Shido Itsuka. I've come to save Tohka!
Let go of her immediately!"	
Message	None	"(I barged in, but Ellen launched an attack at
me that hurt me pretty badly.)"	
Message	Shido	Agh...	
Message	Tohka	"Stop! Stop! Please stop...! Anything but him!
Anything but Shido! I care not what happens
to me! I'll do anything! I concede!"	
Message	Tohka	So... Please do not take Shido from me!	
Message	None	"(My life was at risk, and Tohka fell into
despair, which led to the worst-case
scenario. Sephira's Inverse.)"	
Message	None	"(DEM realized they couldn't take down Tohka
and retreated. In order to get Tohka back to
normal, Miku and I fought her.)"	
Message	None	"(But we were powerless against Tohka's
attacks. As she struck Miku, I panicked, and
I felt energy surge in my left hand.)"	
Message	Miku	What are you...?	
Message	Shido	I promised.	
Message	None	"(I used Zadkiel's power to protect Miku, and
when Miku's brainwash abilities wore off,
Yoshino and the Yamai Sisters came as back up.)"	
Message	Shido	Yo, Tohka. I've come to save you.	
Message	Tohka	Shi...do?	
Message	None	"(I descended to where Tohka was and planted
a soft kiss on her lips. I felt a sense of déjà vu.
When our lips parted, Tohka returned to normal.)"	
Message	Shido	Welcome back, Tohka.	
Message	Tohka	I am back, Shido...	
Message	None	"(And so, we were able to rescue Tohka
without losing anyone. As for Miku...)"	
Message	Miku	OH! You've come for me, darling!	
Message	Shido	D-Darling?!	
Message	None	"(She totally changed. I was so surprised
when Miku kissed me gently.)"	
Message	Miku	"Even if I lose my voice, even if no one hears
me sing again, as long as I have you, that's all
that matters. I will sing for you, and only you."	
Message	None	"(Miku made this promise, and smiled from
ear to ear.)"	
Message	None	"(A few days after I sealed Miku, Reine-san
called me in to test a new game.)"	
Message	None	"(It was a virtual reality game called "My Little
Shido 2". Unlike other games, it required me to
enter a VR-world in order to play it.)"	
Message	None	"(Everyone watched as I fumbled through the
game. However, I spotted someone mysterious,
even by video game standards.)"	
Message	???	"...Let me ask you.
...Love.
...What is love?"	
Message	None	"(I met an interesting girl named Arusu, and
then a bug occurred inside of the game, trapping
me by preventing me from logging out.)"	
Message	None	"(However, in order to learn what love is, Arusu
claimed she needed to perform simulations,
calling in some familiar faces.)"	
Message	None	"(The only way I could return to reality was by
teaching Arusu love. So, I went on a ton of
dates.)"	
Message	Shido	"Oh... sorry. Are you the staff here? You were so
beautiful that I thought you were a doll."	
Message	Tohka	"My, you're very kind. I'm the owner of this shop.
My name is Tohka."	
Message	None	"(There was Tohka, the sophisticated store
clerk.)"	
Message	Shido	H-Hey. Don't put your hand in there.	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... You were bratty, but your spirit tastes
pretty good."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Heavenly. I feel like I'm going to melt. Hehe. Shido,
don't worry. I won't take your life."	
Message	None	(Kaguya and Yuzuru became succubi.)	
Message	Shido	I'll make you forget. All your sorrows, everything.	
Message	Yoshino	No, Shido-san! Yoshinon... is watching.	
Message	None	"(There was Yoshino, widowed from her
partner, Yoshinon.)"	
Message	Kurumi	Here we go, twirly-twirly ♪	
Message	Shido	Twirly-twirly!	
Message	Kurumi	Twirly-twirly ♪	
Message	Shido	Twirly! Twirly!	
Message	None	"(And at the maid café, Kuru―no, actually,
let's forget this one.)"	
Message	None	"(As I went about my daily life, I met the
black-haired Arusu.)"	
Message	Arusu	I am Arusu. There is no doubt about it... I am Arusu.	
Message	Shido	I see... I suppose so.	
Message	Arusu	"Hm... Let's see. I am Arusu. But I guess I could also
say that I'm not Arusu."	
Message	None	"(White and black. There were two Arusus,
leading to me naming the white version.)"	
Message	Shido	How about Maria? Sorry, I just thought of it.	
Message	Maria	No. I want it... Maria, Maria Arusu. My... name.	
Message	None	"(She seemed to like her name, so from that
moment on, she became known as Maria.)"	
Message	None	"(Each time my love for someone grew, the
world reset. Maria would learn something new
about love, and soon acquired new emotions.)"	
Message	Maria	"Yes. That is right. That is how everyone
else conveyed their love to Shido. At the
end of a date, you must kiss."	
Message	Maria	"If I do that, I am sure, I will fully understand
love. If I do that, then Shido... and the others
will be released from this world."	
Message	None	"(Maria had an idea, and we decided to go
on a date together.)"	
Message	None	"(We went to school early, walked home
together after class. We even got closer
with Tohka and the others.)"	
Message	None	"(On my first full day of dating Maria,
things took a turn... At the end of the day,
we kissed.)"	
Message	Maria	What is this...? My powers are, aaaah!	
Message	Shido	Maria... Hey, Maria?!	
Message	Arusu	"Good grief. You made me wait quite a while.
But at long last, the time has come."	
Message	None	"(Maria was unconsciously holding a great
power. By learning emotions, she accidentally
ceded control of the game to the black Arusu.)"	
Message	Arusu	"Don't call me by her name! I have my
own name, my actual name... Marina Arusu.
The name my father bestowed to me!"	
Message	Shido	Marina... That's your name?	
Message	None	"(Marina revealed the truth. Maria was a
copy of Marina. That's why we were trapped
here.)"	
Message	None	"(As a creation of DEM, her mission was to
destroy the game and seize control of the
Fraxinus to destroy the real Tengu City.)"	
Message	None	"(We moved to stop her. I made it to Marina, but by
then, she had assumed a massive amount of power.)"	
Message	Shido	"Ngh... This might be... too much. No... I'll
endure this! I'll protect Maria, even if it
kills me!"	
Message	Maria	"Please, give me the strength to protect Shido.
I... wish to protect Shido. I do not want to
lose him... for everyone, and for myself."	
Message	None	"(The world responded to Maria's wish,
allowing her to manifest an Astral Dress.
This power turned the tide.)"	
Message	Marina	"It would never bend in your favor! You're
destined to disappear, like any copy would!
I am the One who will defeat you, begone!"	
Message	Maria	"Let us combine forces for one more powerful
attack. Marina is likely expecting it as well."	
Message	Shido	Got it! GOOOOOOO!!	
Message	None	"(Thanks to Maria, I was able to summon
Sandalphon. With Marina taken out, the
virtual world ceased, but at a cost...)"	
Message	None	"(Marina, now bracing for defeat, became
unstable, and threatened to drop the Fraxinus
on top of Tengu City.)"	
Message	Shido	"Does that mean both of you will disappear?
No, you absolutely can't!"	
Message	Maria	"This is the best chance we have. For
everyone―for you―to live."	
Message	None	"(I wanted to stop her, even if it meant risking
Marina's life. Maria steeled her resolve, and
headed for Marina.)"	
Message	None	"(I couldn't believe they would disappear. With
Tohka and the rest of the girls' help, Maria and
I barged into the mother room.)"	
Message	None	Maria, Marina! It can't end like this!	
Message	Maria	"It is too late. It is impossible to reset the
Fraxinus' authority control and for Marina
to disappear alone."	
Message	None	"(No matter what, I couldn't have saved them.
In the end, I could only let them go.)"	
Message	Maria	Thank you, Shido. You are the kindest soul.	
Message	Shido	Maria! MARIAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	None	"(Marina disappeared, as did Maria. But not
before she left me with a kiss. Then, the
virtual world disappeared with both Arusus.)"	
Message	None	"(I awoke to find myself back in the real
world. Of course, the Arusus weren't there.)"	
Message	None	"(I felt empty. In the end, I couldn't save them.
But Maria left a message for me, detailing her
true feelings.)"	
Message	Maria	"Most of all, Shido. The time I spent with you, even
the times you do not remember, are treasures to
me. Thanks to you... I learned the answer."	
Message	None	"(In that message was a file. It automatically
installed into my phone. Marina's last gesture.)"	
Message	Shido	M-Maria?! Is that really you, Maria?!	
Message	Maria	Yes. It is your Maria.	
Message	None	"(Before Maria disappeared, it seems Marina
copied Maria's personality data and compiled
an app.)"	
Message	Maria	"I swear to devote myself to helping you,
Shido. That is why you mustn't give up.
Ever. Please be strong."	
Message	Shido	Yeah, I'll do my best. I swear that I'll save them.	
Message	None	(And even now, my date goes on...)
