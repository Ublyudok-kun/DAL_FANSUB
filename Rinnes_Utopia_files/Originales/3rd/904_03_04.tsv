Message	Maria	―Shido, if you take too long, you'll be late.	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I found it! I'll be right out!	
Message	Marina	"Gosh, why didn't you get everything ready last night?
You seriously are so dumb in that sense."	
Message	Shido	I'm really sorry. Thanks for waiting for me.	
Message	Maria	"It's just us today. If you're late Shido, then it's
also our responsibility."	
Message	Marina	"Gosh, what are you, in elementary school? Seriously
can't believe we came back because you forgot
something. I don't like doing double the work."	
Message	Shido	No, I'm so sorry... I totally forgot.	
Message	Marina	"You say that. But we ended up running the last time
too. Seriously, you need to learn, you idiot."	
Message	Maria	"Marina, that's quite enough. We're still going to make
it."	
Message	Shido	Yeah... And... Why are you guys holding my hands?	
Message	Maria	You don't want to, Shido? To hold hands with us...	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not like I don't want to... I was just
wondering why. We didn't do this last time, right?"	
Message	Maria	"It's because you're so indecisive, so Marina said...
We should guide you."	
Message	Marina	"Hey...?! You're the one that asked, Maria! What's a
way to legally hold hands with Shido...?!"	
Message	Maria	Was that so? I don't remember at all.	
Message	Marina	"You remember this... Gosh Shido, don't get the wrong
idea. It's not like I wanted to hold your hand..."	
Message	Maria	Gosh Marina, you're such a typical tsundere.	
Message	Marina	"Shut up! You're acting like the good wife, but your
statements are so venomous!"	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha... Hey, chatting here defeats the purpose,
right? Let's get going."	
Message	Maria	"You're right. Let's go. Gosh Marina, you really went
off on a tangent."	
Message	Marina	"If you're picking a fight with me, I'll take it.
Seriously."	
Message	Shido	Y-You guys, be nice okay?	
Message	Maria	"Hehe. You worry too much, Shido. This is our sisterly
love."	
Message	Marina	Yeah, something like that. We're always like this.	
Message	None	"(Always like this, huh... When did we get to the point
where we could say that so casually?)"	
Message	Shido	You two sure seem to be having fun.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Very much so. It's fun.	
Message	Marina	"Yeah. When we're with you, we never get bored.
Something new happens every single day... That's
what makes it so interesting."	
Message	Shido	You might be right. That's why it's so fun right now.	
Message	Maria	Yes. Well, let's get going, Shido. Hold my hand tight.	
Message	Marina	"You'd better not let go of mine, either. If you do,
you won't hear the end of it."	
Message	Shido	Okay, let's go!	
Message	None	"(And we started to speedwalk. The power from both
hands I held were similar, and it made me realize that
they were truly sisters.)"	
Message	None	"(Our daily lives continued. Slowly, one step at a time.
And it was nothing but the ordinary, yet it's not
ordinary at all.)"	
Message	None	"(But I believe that this was what it should have been.
The reason why I chose the world Rio left us―)"	
Message	Maria・Marina	Shido!	
Message	None	(I think their smiles were the answer itself.)
