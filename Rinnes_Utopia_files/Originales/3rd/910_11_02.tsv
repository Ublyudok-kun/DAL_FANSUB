Message	Tamae	Ah, Itsuka-kun. Hello.	
Message	Shido	Oh, sensei? What are you doing here?	
Message	Tamae	"Oh, I had errands to run. I still have quite
a ways to go."	
Message	Shido	Oh. Gotcha...	
Message	None	"(She's always busy. We just finished the
Tenou Festival.)"	
Message	Tamae	Itsuka-kun, are you on your way home?	
Message	Shido	"Um, you could call it that. I'm kind of taking
a walk."	
Message	Tamae	Is something bothering you?	
Message	Shido	Hm, a little bit. It's not a big deal, though.	
Message	Tamae	"When you put it like that, I'm curious. Feel
free to let me know if you need anything."	
Message	Shido	Then, would you mind...?	
Message	Tamae	Go ahead.	
Message	Shido	What is the most important thing to you?	
Message	Tamae	"Oh, hm... That is an abstract question.
"	
Message	Tamae	"The most important thing... the most important
thing. It's difficult to pin it down to one thing."	
Message	Shido	It's a tough question, isn't it?	
Message	Tamae	"Yes. I mean, my work is important to me, as
are my friends. Of course, my students are
too, but the most important is... my family."	
Message	Shido	Family, huh? I could see that.	
Message	Tamae	"Family. A warm family. I want one...
A new life with a significant..."	
Message	Shido	Sensei? Sensei?!	
Message	Tamae	"I don't want to be alone. I don't want to live
and die alone. *whimper* I need to start a
family with someone fast. My family..."	
Message	Shido	Agh... Oh, man. This isn't going well.	
Message	None	(I think I struck a nerve!)	
Message	Shido	"I-I think family is a great answer! Thank you!
That was helpful!"	
Message	Tamae	*gasp*...! Hey, Itsuka-kun! I was still talk―	
Message	Shido	Thank you!	
Message	None	"(Before things got worse, I ran away as quickly
as I could. Far, far away from her.)"
