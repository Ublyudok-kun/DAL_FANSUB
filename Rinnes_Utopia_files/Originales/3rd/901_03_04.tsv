Message	Shido	Phew, that should do it.	
Message	None	"(Phew. I didn't expect to have after-school duties
today... No one's left in the classroom but me.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, I still have to get ready for dinner, but I have
time. I'll drop by the market to pick up some food.)"	
Message	Shido	Oh...	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, Rinne said she's going to be
handling it. Then I have nothing else I can think of
doing. Hm... I guess I'll just go home and help Rinne.)"	
Message	None	"(Wait a minute... That girl waiting at the gates, could
it be...)"	
Message	Kotori	Well it's about time, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	"Ah, so it was you, Kotori. What are you doing here?
Oh, were you looking for Reine-san?"	
Message	Kotori	"Ne-ga-to-ry.
"	
Message	Kotori	Jeez, I was waiting for you.	
Message	Shido	Oh, really? It's rare for you to come pick me up.	
Message	Kotori	"I do it when I feel like, okay?! Jeez, you don't get
me at all."	
Message	Shido	Sorry, sorry. I had after-school duty today.	
Message	Kotori	"Well, don't worry. It's not like I had anything specific
on the docket. I just wanted to hang out with you
and walk home together."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Hang out? It's really rare for you to say that...	
Message	Kotori	"What's that? Are you saying you don't want to hang
out with your adorable little sister?"	
Message	Shido	"No, that's not it. I was just thinking how we haven't
done much of that lately."	
Message	Kotori	"That may be true. Hehehe. I just feel like hanging out
today!"	
Message	Shido	All right. Wanna drop by the arcade, then?	
Message	Kotori	Huh, the arcade?	
Message	Shido	Then where do you want to go?	
Message	???	Oh, look! I found darling!	
Message	Shido	Hm...?	
Message	None	(I heard a clear voice from behind...)	
Message	Miku	"Gosh～! I was watching all the students walking home
when I realized you weren't in the crowd, darling. I was
so worried!"	
Message	Shido	Miku...?! You, too?!	
Message	Miku	What do you mean, "You, too?"	
Message	Miku	 Oh! Kotori-chan!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, it's Miku～ Herro!	
Message	Miku	"*Giggle*... Hello, Kotori-chan. You're as adorable as
usual."	
Message	Kotori	Hehe. You won't get anything for complimenting me.	
Message	Miku	I'm only stating the obvious. I want to hug you～	
Message	Kotori	NO!	
Message	None	(Kotori swiftly dodged Miku's arms. So swift...)	
Message	Kotori	"I'm going to go hang out with Onii-chan～ I don't have
time to hang out with you, Miku!"	
Message	Miku	"Awww... But I was waiting, though. Please take me with
you～"	
Message	None	"(That's true. It'd be messed up to just say bye to her
here.)"	
Message	Shido	"It'd be rude to just leave her behind. Can't we bring
Miku along?"	
Message	Kotori	Mmm. I guess we can't help it. Got it!	
Message	Miku	"Yay, I'm so excited! So do you know where you want to
go?"	
Message	Miku	"I'm fine going anywhere, as long as you're there,
darling!"	
Message	Kotori	I want to go somewhere we never usually go～	
Message	Shido	"A place we've never gone, huh? Why don't we head to the
station, then? Let's think about it as we walk."	
Message	None	"(God knows who's going to pass by the front of the
school and start spreading rumors.)"	
Message	Miku	Okay, darling. Let's go!	
Message	Kotori	Let's go, go, go!	
Message	Shido	Agh, you guys! I can't walk when you hold on like this!	
Message	Shido	"Oh, come to think of it, I have a coupon for karaoke.
Wanna go?"	
Message	Kotori	Aww... Karaoke?	
Message	Miku	"I am totally for it. I will sing from the bottom of my
heart for you, darling ♪"	
Message	Kotori	We've gone before, so no!	
Message	Miku	A-Aww! I was just about to shine...	
Message	Shido	Sorry, Miku. Then what do you want to do?	
Message	None	(No arcade, no karaoke. Then what's left is―)	
Message	Kotori	Onii-chan, I want to go somewhere I can move my body!	
Message	Miku	Oh, that's great. I'm all for it!	
Message	Shido	Move our bodies... huh.	
Message	None	(What's a good spot...)	
Message	Shido	"I think there was a general amusement arcade near the
station. Wanna check that out?"	
Message	Miku	"That's a nice idea, darling. They have darts, a pool
table, bowling and lots of other things."	
Message	Kotori	Oh, bowling! I want to bowl!	
Message	Shido	Got it, bowling it is. Miku, are you okay with that?	
Message	Miku	Yes! Totally!	
Message	Kotori	Miku, are you good at bowling?	
Message	Miku	Hmm, so-so? I don't think I'm terrible.	
Message	Kotori	I see. Then I can't wait to see what you're made of.	
Message	Miku	How about you, Kotori-chan?	
Message	Kotori	"Mmm. It's been a while for me. I'm not that confident,
but I'm going to defeat my brother!"	
Message	Miku	"Kotori, you're so cute, wanting to compete against
your brother! Then, why don't we team up and aim to
defeat darling?"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah! I'm gonna win!	
Message	Shido	"It's been a while, so can't we just enjoy it rather
than competing...?"	
Message	None	"(Well I guess it's nice that they're enjoying it...
It's not often that we come here, so I'll just go
with the flow.)"	
Message	None	"(The bowling alley on a weekday. Even though it's the
evening, not too many people are here. Just a few
other parties aside from us.)"	
Message	None	(We were able to get a lane when...)	
Message	Kotori	"*Whimper*... The ball's so heavy. I won't be able to
throw iiit..."	
Message	Shido	"Why don't you just use the kids' size? It'll be easier to
throw it, no?"	
Message	Kotori	Awww, that's why I don't like these kinds of sports...	
Message	None	"(I guess not many kids visit here, so there weren't
any around. We needed to go to the counter to ask for
one, but Kotori refused, so she's using a heavy ball.)"	
Message	Shido	If you're too shy, I can go get it?	
Message	Kotori	DON'T NEED IT! Come on, let's go!	
Message	None	(She worries me...)	
Message	Kotori	Awww, not another gutter ball...	
Message	Miku	It'll be fine, Kotori-chan. I'll avenge you!	
Message	Shido	Avenge... Kotori just messed up.	
Message	Miku	Forget the minor details! Here I go!	
Message	None	(She's swinging really hard?!)	
Message	Miku	Oh...?!	
Message	Miku	Oops, I may have curved it too much...!	
Message	Kotori	Oh, so close! It totally curved!	
Message	Miku	"Sorry, Kotori-chan. I messed up～ I'll be sure to get
it in next time, okay?!"	
Message	Shido	That's pretty scary... I can't let my guard down.	
Message	Miku	It's your turn next, darling!	
Message	Shido	All right, you watch.	
Message	None	"(We continued to bowl and I was able to maintain the
lead.)"	
Message	None	"(Miku's scoring a lot. Kotori's bowling granny-style,
but at least she stopped getting gutter balls. We
could've avoided this if she had gotten a kids' ball.)"	
Message	None	(Finally we're at the end—It's Miku's turn.)	
Message	Kotori	Mikuuu. You'd better score, or else we'll lose!	
Message	Miku	"Don't worry, Kotori-chan. An idol always makes it
come together at the end."	
Message	Shido	No hard feelings, okay?	
Message	Miku	Okay! Girls always win these things ♪ Yah!	
Message	Kotori	Whoa?! That's...?	
Message	Miku	This is going to be good.	
Message	Miku	All right! I got eight!	
Message	Kotori	Woooow! Keep going!	
Message	Miku	We did it, Kotori-chan! Spare!	
Message	Kotori	Finish off Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	Uh, but she needs more than six to beat me—	
Message	Miku	Leave it to me! Here I go! Yah!	
Message	Miku	This looks like...!	
Message	None	"(The ball spun furiously and slowly bore down on the
center pin!)"	
Message	Kotori	Whoa! Amazing, Miku! A strike! STRIKE!	
Message	Miku	Hehe, I did it! I did it, Kotori-chan!	
Message	Shido	Damn it, she really did do it at the end...	
Message	None	(I never expected her to beat me for real.)	
Message	Kotori	"Okaaaay, so you lose, Onii-chan! The loser has to be
punished!"	
Message	Miku	Hehe. What should we make him do?	
Message	Shido	Um... I never promised I'd do it, though.	
Message	None	(But I did lose. Maybe I can't avoid it...)	
Message	Kotori	"Hmmm. That was so fun! Gourmet ice cream after
bowling tastes so much sweeter!"	
Message	None	"(As punishment, I had to buy them really expensive
gourmet ice cream. Well, as long as they're happy, I
guess all is well.)"	
Message	Miku	"Yes, I had so much fun today. I want to try something
else next time."	
Message	Shido	I heard there are places we can play tennis and futsal.	
Message	Kotori	Wow, cool! Then let's do something else next time!	
Message	Miku	"Yeah... It's more fun to play sports. Next time, let's
bring Tohka-san and Rinne-san, too!"	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, I totally agree! It'll be so fun with everyone!	
Message	Shido	"Haha, you're right. Let's find some time for all of us
to come together."	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I think you need to prepare to lose again next
time."	
Message	Shido	"What... How dare you say that, little sister. I'm gonna
show you what I'm made of!"	
Message	Kotori	Hahaha! You're just like Kaguya!	
Message	Miku	She has a point there... Hehe.	
Message	Shido	"Ah... Well, forget about that for now. Let's head
home. We'll be making Rinne wait if we take too much
time."	
Message	Kotori	Oh that's right, huh? Then let's go home!	
Message	Miku	Aww, Kotori-chan! Wait for me!	
Message	Shido	Man, after all that exercise...	
Message	None	"(I feel like it's been a while since I played like
this. It was actually really fun. I'm glad we were able
to share the experience together.)"
