Message	None	"(A sudden attack... I had a sense that something was
off, but I couldn't put my finger on it.)"	
Message	None	"(The city I saw shouldn't have been any different.
It was the usual scenery. The path I was used to
taking.)"	
Message	None	"(But I wonder why... it seemed like something was
missing.)"	
Message	None	"(Then again, this wasn't the first time I felt this
way. For the feeling to hit me while things were
relatively peaceful was a strange thought, indeed.)"	
Message	None	"(I don't know what that feeling is, but I'm sure that
something's missing here.)"	
Message	None	"(Despite not having any evidence to back it up, even
though it was illogical... Deep down, I was certain.)"	
Message	Shido	*Sigh*...	
Message	Kotori	"What's the matter, Onii-chan? Why did you sigh out
of the blue?"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Ah, no... I was just... wondering what to make
for dinner."	
Message	None	"(I tried to play it off as I plated our breakfast and
put it on the dining table.)"	
Message	Kotori	Your worries are so innocent～	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that?!	
Message	Kotori	You're you, Onii-chan!	
Message	Shido	"That makes no sense! ...Not that it's a big deal or
anything."	
Message	Kotori	"Aww, got it～ But if you feel sick, be sure to rest,
okay?"	
Message	Shido	Got it. Thanks for worrying about me.	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe. I am your dependable little sister, after all.	
Message	Shido	Yes, I am always depending on you, Imouto-sama.	
Message	Kotori	Hehehe. Leave it to me～	
Message	Shido	Well, let's just eat breakfast. Come on, it's ready.	
Message	Kotori	Okaaaay.	
Message	Kotori	Thanks for the meal!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	Huh...? Onii-chan. Thank you for the meal～	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	Kotori	...	
Message	Shido	Whoa?! Wh-What are you doing, Kotori?!	
Message	Kotori	"Right back at you. "It's not a big deal," my ass.
You're totally zoned out."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... Sorry.	
Message	Kotori	"...So? What happened? If you're stressed about
something, just tell me about it."	
Message	Shido	"Hmmm... I know you're just going to think I'm crazy,
but..."	
Message	Kotori	Stop it with the disclaimers and just tell me already.	
Message	Shido	"Oh. Well... there was someone besides me who used
to make breakfast... right?"	
Message	Kotori	"Obviously. Like mom and me. And the times when
Tohka and the others helped. Even Maria cooked for
us the other day."	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not that. That's not what I meant. I don't
know who it is, but I feel like there was someone else
who used to be in the kitchen a lot."	
Message	Kotori	Huh? You don't know who it is... Are you crazy?	
Message	Shido	...I told you you'd think that...	
Message	Kotori	"I never said I wouldn't. But... What the hell, is this
some kind of scary story?"	
Message	Shido	No. It's just... I felt like someone was here.	
Message	Kotori	Hm... When was this?	
Message	Shido	"When? Um... maybe... before we went into summer
break?"	
Message	Kotori	"Huh? What are you talking about? If it's that recently,
there's no way that any of us would forget. I bet you
it's just some kind of summer fever dream."	
Message	Shido	You might be right...	
Message	Kotori	"...If you're really concerned about it, you could see
a counselor."	
Message	Shido	"Oh, no. It's not that bad. I think I'm just out of it or
something."	
Message	Kotori	"I see. Well if you say so, Shido... Anyways, let's end
the dream talk here. If we keep hanging around, we'll
be late."	
Message	Shido	Right. Oh, you're right... I should hurry.	
Message	None	"(Kotori's right. The only thing I have is this weird
sense inside me that something's off. I'm sure it's
just a continuation of my dream.)"	
Message	None	"(But... no matter how much I think that, once I
acknowledged this feeling, the fog in my heart
wouldn't go away.)"	
Message	Tohka	What is the matter, Shido? You seem a little down.	
Message	Origami	"You clearly weren't focused in class. That must be
because of Tohka Yatogami. You should disappear
from Shido's surroundings immediately."	
Message	Tohka	What?! Don't be a fool, Origami Tobiichi!	
Message	Shido	"Hey, come on you guys, stop it! It's not a big deal.
I... was just thinking about a dream I had."	
Message	Tohka	Dream? What kind of dream?	
Message	Shido	"Hmm... I don't remember it in detail. I think it was a
dream about an ordinary day."	
Message	Tohka	"A dream about an ordinary day? Then that means
it's a dream of me being with you! That must be fun!"	
Message	Shido	"Ah, that's not exactly it... but I guess it's not wrong,
either."	
Message	Origami	"How naïve. If you experience the same day every day,
you'll lack necessary stimulation. Shido, you need a
more intense life... You should come live with me."	
Message	Shido	"Wait! Can you not say things that give people the
wrong impression?!"	
Message	Origami	"It's not a wrong impression. I'm just going off of your
desires."	
Message	Shido	Can you not talk as if I'm some huge pervert?!	
Message	Ai	"Hey, did you hear?! Itsuka-kun is forcing Tobiichi-san
to be perverted again!"	
Message	Mai	"That's not all! He's also trying to spend the night with
Tohka-chan as well!"	
Message	Mii	"What a low-life! Seriously, what a turn off. It goes
against the ethics of modern youth!"	
Message	Shido	"Stop putting the blame on me! Seriously, it never ends
with you guys. Just cut it out!"	
Message	Ai	Look who's talking! The nerve!	
Message	Mai	"Every damn day, we have to watch you flirt! God, you
walking pervert!"	
Message	Mii	Unforgivable. Seriously, beyond forgiving!	
Message	Tonomachi	Yeah! Even if God forgives you, I won't!	
Message	Shido	You stay out of this!	
Message	Tonomachi	Aww...!	
Message	Shido	Argh...	
Message	None	"(Tohka and Origami are at odds again, and our
classmates are making a ruckus. The usual.)"	
Message	None	"(I wonder if I feel like something is missing here
because of my dream.)"	
Message	None	(Hm? That person there...)	
Message	Shido	"Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, and even Miku...? What an
odd combination."	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... Shido-san! Um, I was... um, out shopping...	
Message	None	"(What Yoshino handed me was a plastic bag full of
fish. It seemed like there were all kinds in vibrant
colors.)"	
Message	None	"(...It looked really chaotic. There were even some
that looked like she fished them out of the deep sea.
Where did she buy these?)"	
Message	Kaguya	"Hehehe... You sure seem surprised, my slave. You are
witnessing the true power that dwells inside of us."	
Message	Shido	Um... So what are you trying to say?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Hehehe. Are you sure you wanna ask? You really\nwanna know? Shido-kun, you're going to get super\nturned on hearing what a bad girl Yoshino was today."	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon...!	
Message	Miku	"Hehehe. We were all shopping together, and
because we were so cute, the shop owner gave us
a lot of freebies～"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Ugh, gosh... Bad Miku-chan! You can't just give away\nthe secret so easily!"	
Message	Miku	"Now, now, who cares... Darling would have figured it
out immediately. Right, darling?"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yeah... But that sure is a lot...	
Message	None	"(If these were mostly freebies, I'm kind of worried
about the store...)"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Of course, it wasn't just Yoshino. Kaguya and Yuzuru
were there, so it's only natural that the owner would
give us freebies."	
Message	Shido	I see... Wait, is that supposed to convince me?	
Message	Yoshino	Um, Shido-san... Here...!	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're going to give this to me?	
Message	Yoshino	"K-Knowing you... You'd make something delicious out
of it."	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're starting to sound like Tohka.	
Message	Yoshino	A-Ah...	
Message	Shido	"We should use them while they're still fresh. Well,
why don't we have this as dinner, then? Let's all eat
together."	
Message	Yoshinon	"YAY! You're amazing, Shido-kun! So generous!"	
Message	Miku	"I'd be so happy to be with you and the others! I will
go no matter what!"	
Message	Kaguya	"Oh! That's a great idea! A holy supper from the deep
ocean god... Clearly fit for me."	
Message	Yuzuru	"Correction. Kaguya, there are river fish mixed in
there as well."	
Message	Kaguya	"What?! I-It was only a figure of speech! I didn't make
a mistake, okay?!"	
Message	Yuzuru	"Sad laugh. That's just an excuse that you couldn't
differentiate between the types of fish here. Pfft."	
Message	Kaguya	Rrgh! Yuzuru, you know what?!	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. What are you talking about... Anyways, I'm
going to rush home. What do you guys want to do?"	
Message	Yoshino	Oh... I'm going to stop by my place first.	
Message	Shido	I see. Then I guess I can walk you home.	
Message	Yoshinon	"Oh, I know. Hey Shido-kun?"	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Yoshinon	"Well, since she visits so often, don't you think you\nshould give Yoshino a spare key?"	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yoshinon...?!	
Message	Shido	"Spare key, huh... Come to think of it, a spare key
would—"	
Message	???	"I———ake———of——t"	
Message	Shido	...What was that?	
Message	Yoshino	Shido...san? What's the matter...?	
Message	Shido	"N-Nothing. Spare key, huh... I may have an extra so
I'll look for it, okay?"	
Message	Yoshinon	"Amazing, Shido-kun. You're so understanding!"	
Message	Yoshino	S-Sorry, Shido-san...	
Message	Shido	No problem. I'll see you then?	
Message	Yoshino	Y-Yes! I'll visit later, okay...?	
Message	Shido	Sure. I'll be waiting.	
Message	None	"(Is something happening? I can sense it. There's
something wrong with me today.)"	
Message	None	(And besides, what was that...)	
Message	Shido	"All right. I think I'm ready. I feel like I'm forgetting...
Oh, that's right. Yoshinon brought up the spare key.
I think it's around this shelf..."	
Message	Shido	Huh, it's not here. I thought there was an extra one.	
Message	None	(Hmm... Not here, either.)	
Message	Shido	Then, is it in my room?	
Message	None	"(When I got in the room, I had this feeling... that
the spare key would be in here.)"	
Message	None	"(Come to think of it, it'd be odd that a spare key
would be in my room. Because I'm always carrying
my own key around.)"	
Message	None	"(Well, no point in worrying about that now. Anyways,
I'll try this drawer.)"	
Message	None	"(There it is. A small bag at the back of the drawer.
The design was clearly not something I chose.)"	
Message	None	"(I was certain of it. That there would be a spare key
in here.)"	
Message	Shido	"Huh? Why did I think that? Not only that, but when did
I even make a spare?"	
Message	Shido	"...Wait, Kotori gave it to me. That's right. I just forgot...
There's nothing weird about it."	
Message	None	"(As I predicted, there was a key inside the bag. Just
a key on its own, not decorated, no key ring.)"	
Message	None	...I'll take good care of it.	
Message	None	"(I definitely remembered something right now.
A voice I don't recognize. But it felt so nostalgic...
and the voice was so soft...)"	
Message	None	"(I squeezed the key tightly, and it made a dent in my
palm.)"	
Message	None	"(Along with the cold metal feeling of it, I also felt
a pang of pain go through my chest.)"	
Message	None	"(It felt like all the power in my body was quickly
leaving me. I kneeled slowly onto the floor.)"	
Message	None	"(My heart was pounding. It was similar to something
I remembered... I know, it was like when I used the Spirit's power...)"	
Message	Shido	—*Grunt*... Aha...	
Message	None	"(I felt a sensation like everything was being dragged
around me, then I felt my consciousness being
engulfed.)"	
Message	None	"I...forever, okay?"
