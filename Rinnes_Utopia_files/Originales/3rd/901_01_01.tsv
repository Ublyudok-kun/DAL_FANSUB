Message	None	"(What is this... I feel really nostalgic. Oh that's right.
I've seen this... before...)"	
Message	???	The most important thing... Where is it...?	
Message	None	(Huh? The most important thing?)	
Message	None	Would I know... when I meet them?	
Message	None	(Meet them... You're―)	
Message	Kotori	WAKE UP! Onii-chan, rise and shine!	
Message	Shido	...Hurghk―?!	
Message	None	"(Kotori's foot hit me square in the gut, and I had no
choice but to roll over in my bed.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Ahahaha! You hear that? What a funny sound. He's
on all fours now!"	
Message	Shido	"K-Kotori... What the heck... There are some things...
you should do, and some things you shouldn't do..."	
Message	Kotori	Hahaha. My bad, Onii-chan.	
Message	Shido	How can you be so casual about this?! ...Ow...	
Message	Kotori	"It's your fault for not waking up on time. Come on!
Breakfast, breakfast!"	
Message	Shido	...Oh, that's right. Sorry, let me get it ready now...	
Message	None	(Kotori must be hungry. I have to hurry.)	
Message	Kotori	"Hm? You don't need to get it ready. I mean, it's
already ready."	
Message	Shido	Huh? Already ready?	
Message	Kotori	"Yeah. It was done a long time ago! Come on dearie,
be a lamb and get ready in... 40 seconds!"	
Message	Shido	What kind of grandma are you...	
Message	None	"(Wait a minute. Are you going to tell me Kotori made
breakfast? What is going on here?)"	
Message	Shido	Well, I guess I'll start by changing...	
Message	None	"(My little sister worked hard. I can't let the food go
cold.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh, Onii-chan. I said 40 seconds... *nom, nom*...
I'm already eating... *nom*."	
Message	Shido	"Your mouth's full of food, dear sister. It isn't good
manners, so don't eat and talk at the same time."	
Message	Maria	"Good morning, Shido. I made toast, ham and eggs,
and a salad for breakfast."	
Message	Shido	"Good morning, Maria. Ah, so you made breakfast today,
huh? I knew it. I mean Kotori is the designated eater."	
Message	Kotori	*Nom, nom*... How rude, Nom-chan.	
Message	None	(Who is that...)	
Message	Shido	I wish I coulda helped you.	
Message	Maria	"It's fine. This isn't a big deal. Shido, you're like the
master of the house. Be bold from time to time and
relish in doing nothing."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Thanks, Maria.	
Message	Maria	"You're welcome. It's touching to hear you say that
much. Now Shido, please sit."	
Message	Shido	Sure.	
Message	None	"(I sat down, but it felt a little strange to see Maria
standing in the kitchen.)"	
Message	Maria	Hm? Is something the matter, Shido?	
Message	Shido	Oh... Nothing.	
Message	None	"(That's right. Maria is often here in the kitchen, so it's
not exactly an unusual scene.)"	
Message	None	"(She served me breakfast while I was seated. The
salad was full of vegetables in vibrant colors. There
was even a bit of cereal in it, too.)"	
Message	Shido	"Whoa. It looks so delicious. The dressing... Was this
made from scratch?"	
Message	Maria	"Yes, I made it myself. I'm sure you'll love it. Please
help yourself."	
Message	None	"(Maria's homemade dressing tasted as though she used
onion paste as a base. I think she cooked it so it
wouldn't be too bitter, just very mild and sweet.)"	
Message	None	(I bit into a piece of toast.)	
Message	None	"(Mmm, delicious. It's so nice with a lot of butter on
the toast.)"	
Message	Shido	"Delicious... This is delicious, Maria! You've long
since surpassed me."	
Message	Maria	"Do you think so? I don't know myself. But if that is
true, then I've finally obtained the right to marry
you, Shido. Is that what this means?"	
Message	Shido	M-M-M-Marry?!	
Message	Kotori	"Oh, that's right. You've always said that, huh? That
because you can cook yourself, you don't need a wife."	
Message	Shido	That has nothing to do with this!	
Message	Maria	Hehe... That's unfortunate.	
Message	Shido	You guys...	
Message	None	"(But seriously, Maria's definitely improved. She's
cooked for us before, but... why does it feel like I
haven't eaten it in a while?)"	
Message	Maria	"...You look like there's something on your mind. Is
something the matter?"	
Message	Shido	Oh... Nothing. I was just thinking about something.	
Message	Maria	Thinking. Um... Shido, could it be...	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	Kotori	"Gosh. It's rude to be lost in thought while eating,
Onii-chan."	
Message	Shido	R-Right... Sorry. Let's hurry up and eat.	
Message	None	"(It seemed like Maria had something to say, but... I
wonder what it was. Well, I guess I can ask her after
I send Kotori off.)"	
Message	Kotori	"Well, I'll be on my way then! You're still going to be
here for a bit, right?"	
Message	Shido	"...Yeah. I'll leave after I clean up with Maria. I
still have some time."	
Message	Kotori	Mm. Got it. Later!	
Message	Maria	Later, Kotori.	
Message	Shido	Be careful, okay?!	
Message	Kotori	Got it!	
Message	Shido	"...Maria, weren't you in the middle of saying
something earlier?"	
Message	Maria	Shido, do you not question why I'm here?	
Message	Shido	Question why you're here?	
Message	None	"(Why would I question why she's here? Maria's
always been here... Wait.)"	
Message	Maria	"Do you remember when the last time was that I spoke
to you?"	
Message	Shido	Oh yeah, huh... Uh...	
Message	None	"(That's right. I just spoke to Maria the other day. I
met her in the virtual world and we spent time
together...)"	
Message	Shido	In the end you got in my cell...!	
Message	Maria	"So I was right. You remember. The real time you spent
with me."	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, I was a little confused a while ago, but I
remember now. You and Marina. How I met you two
in the virtual world. Of course I wouldn't forget."	
Message	Maria	I see. Then clearly we are in some abnormal condition.	
Message	Shido	Abnormal...?	
Message	Maria	"...Yes. This world has been altered somehow. I don't
even know if this is reality."	
Message	Shido	Not reality? That's crazy...	
Message	None	(But thanks to Marina, Maria was able to come ba―)	
Message	Maria	"Shido, have you forgotten? I'm the management AI of
the Fraxinus. I'm normally an existence comprised of
just data. However, I am here..."	
Message	Shido	"I see! The only way I can communicate with you is in
the virtual world... Why didn't I realize this?"	
Message	None	"(That's right. Maria's physical body only exists in that
virtual reality.)"	
Message	Shido	Then does that mean we're in virtual reality again?	
Message	Maria	"No, that is not the case. Due to the damage the
Fraxinus had sustained, "My Little Shido 2" has
completely stopped functioning."	
Message	Shido	Then this isn't virtual reality... but reality?	
Message	Maria	"You see, just earlier I asked Kotori if she felt that
it was odd to see me here, but Kotori answered quite
naturally that I've been living here since last week."	
Message	Shido	And that's when you realized this was odd...	
Message	Maria	"Exactly. I don't know how or why, but it's clear that
everyone else besides you and me had their memories
altered somehow. It may be an attack of some kind."	
Message	Shido	"Altering memories... Maybe in the virtual world, but
is that possible in reality...?"	
Message	Maria	"Well the powers of Spirits and the technology that
follows it can be pretty mysterious. So I cannot say
with certainty that it is impossible."	
Message	Shido	"...You have a point. Kotori being like that too must
mean that everyone in Ratatoskr must be in the same
situation inside the Fraxinus."	
Message	Maria	"I cannot confirm it, but we can assume so. Even you,
with your Spirit powers, seem to be affected slightly.
However, it seems I've not been affected at all..."	
Message	Shido	Is it because you're AI?	
Message	Maria	I assume. Of course, this is all speculation.	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Maria	"In my memory, it felt like this world suddenly
appeared. If you have memories from before, can
you tell me what life was like then?"	
Message	Shido	"Uh... I wonder what I was doing... Someone asked me
to look for something..."	
Message	None	"(No matter how hard I thought, it felt like there was
a haze in my brain that kept me from remembering.)"	
Message	Shido	Sorry, I can't really remember.	
Message	Maria	"I suppose it's not that easy. There are currently too
many unknowns. I think we should continue to observe
for a little while longer."	
Message	Shido	"R-Right... Let's do that. I'll try my best to remember,
too."	
Message	Maria	Hehe... I'll be counting on you.	
Message	Maria	"But I don't think we should act too suspicious. If we
take into consideration the person who made this
happen..."	
Message	None	"(The person who made this happen... Could it be a
Spirit or DEM?)"	
Message	Shido	"Got it. I'll be careful. Maria, you be careful too,
all right?"	
Message	Maria	...Of course. I am your Maria.	
Message	Shido	Y-You can't say that in front of people, okay?!	
Message	Maria	Why not? Do you have something to hide?	
Message	Shido	"Well um... I guess you'll give off the wrong
impression."	
Message	Maria	Hehe... I know. That was my way of joking.	
Message	Shido	"*Sigh*... I'm sweating buckets here. Anyways, Maria.
Why are you dressed in our school uniform?"	
Message	Maria	Don't tell me... you just noticed?	
Message	Shido	Oh well... um... sorry.	
Message	None	"(Crap... Did I upset Maria? Um, at a time like this,
I―)"	
Choice		Looks good on you.	
Choice		Does that mean we get to go to school together?	
Message	Shido	"Well... I know it may be late, but you look really
good in our uniform, Maria."	
Message	Maria	...?! Really?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, of course. It's very refreshing.	
Message	Maria	I see. Thank you.	
Message	Shido	You weren't wearing a uniform in the virtual world.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I didn't think I needed to. But now I'm happy I
got to wear it."	
Message	Shido	"Haha, nice. I'm glad we get to be here together,
Maria."	
Message	Maria	Shido, it's terrible how good you are with women.	
Message	Shido	What?! Did I say something really messed up?	
Message	Maria	"No. But I'd recommend that you not say things that
would give the wrong impression."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... I didn't mean it that way.	
Message	Maria	Then you must study more, shouldn't you?	
Message	Shido	You are absolutely right.	
Message	Shido	"Ah... If you're in a uniform, then that means you get
to go to school with us?"	
Message	Maria	"That seems to be the case. Since last week, I've been
a pretty girl homestaying at the Itsuka residence."	
Message	Shido	I see... Wait, homestay? So you're living here?!	
Message	Maria	Yes. That's what we did before, so it makes sense.	
Message	Shido	"Well, I guess you have a point... But you're going to
call yourself a pretty girl..."	
Message	Maria	Is there a problem with that?	
Message	Shido	Not at all.	
Message	None	(I mean it's true. She is pretty...)	
Message	Shido	...So what about Tohka and the others?	
Message	Maria	"I believe they're at the mansion... but since it's
different from virtual reality, I can't speak for Kurumi
and Miku."	
Message	Shido	You don't know, Maria?	
Message	Maria	"I do not have the access right to the Fraxinus or
this world. I suppose to a certain extent, I'm simply
human."	
Message	Shido	"Then I can't be depending on you all the time then,
huh? I have to take action too."	
Message	Maria	"Yes. I will keep you apprised of any updates as
they are confirmed."	
Message	Maria	"But perhaps we've spoken too much. Even if we wish
to clarify the situation, it would be best that we
hurry and go to school."	
Message	Shido	"You're right. Let's hurry and clean this up. We'll
go together, Maria."	
Message	Maria	Okay!
