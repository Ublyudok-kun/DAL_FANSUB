Message	Shido	The most important thing, huh...	
Message	Ai	Oh, heeeey. It's you, Itsuka-kun.	
Message	Mai	Looks like... something's stressing you out.	
Message	Mii	"Why don't you just admit it, and turn yourself
in? If you do it now, your sentence won't be as
severe."	
Message	Shido	"Why would I do something like that? I was
thinking about something. About what the
most important thing could be."	
Message	Ai	Ah, so the time has finally come...	
Message	Shido	Excuse me?	
Message	Mai	"I knew this would happen some day!
We all saw it coming!"	
Message	Mii	"That's why we've been warning you, but
you're a fool who wouldn't listen."	
Message	Shido	Uh, what are you guys talking about?	
Message	Ai	"Shido Itsuka, you played with multiple
women, and the root of all evil..."	
Message	Mai	But one day, you must choose only one!	
Message	Mii	"The bright beauty, the solemn valedictorian,
your childhood friend, the twins, the mysterious
transfer student, and a girl out of your league."	
Message	Ai	But who will remain? TOHKA-CHAN, OF COURSE!	
Message	Mai	You have to pick her.	
Message	Mii	Seriously. It's written in the stars.	
Message	Shido	"Don't get me wrong, ladies. I wasn't talking
about Tohka and the girls."	
Message	Ai	"Now does this mean you plan on getting
married as soon as you graduate?"	
Message	Mai	"Possibly! In the season of our lives, you take
your vows of marriage on graduation day!
That's what Tohka would've wanted!"	
Message	Mii	I won't graduate from you Shido ♪	
Message	Ai, Mai, Mii	KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!	
Message	Shido	...	
Message	None	"(Okay. I'm going to slip out while they're
distracted by this fantasy they've created.)"
