Message	Tamae	Oh, Itsuka-kun. Do you have a minute?	
Message	Shido	Sure, Tama―I mean, sensei―what is it?	
Message	Tamae	"Well, this is random, but do you think Arusu-san
and Sonogami-san are stressed about something?"	
Message	Shido	Maria and Rinne...?	
Message	None	"(She had a point. Those two have a lot on
their plates. I'm sure their minds feel heavy.
I'll have to play it off though.)"	
Message	Shido	Uh. I didn't think so. Why do you think so?	
Message	Tamae	Hm. If I were to put it into words... I have a hunch.	
Message	Shido	A hunch...	
Message	Tamae	Yes. Call it a teacher's instinct...	
Message	Shido	I see. Well, I'll be on my way.	
Message	Tamae	"Hm? I have another hunch! Itsuka, could
it be―!"	
Message	Shido	Y-Yes?	
Message	Tamae	Are you stressed about something, too?	
Message	Shido	Oh... U-Uhhh. Nothing in particular.	
Message	Tamae	"Hmm, I see. Well, if you notice anything
about Sonogami-san and Arusu-san, be
sure to tell me, okay?"	
Message	Shido	Okay. Later, sensei.	
Message	Tamae	"Okay. Good-bye.
"	
Message	Tamae	Hm... It is just as I thought.	
Message	None	(Tama-chan is smarter than she lets on.)	
Message	None	"(She sure is reliable. Well, not where
marriage is concerned.)"
