Message	None	"(One week had passed. Rinne is here, Maria is here.
Everyone's here. The usual daily lives in this world.)"	
Message	None	"(But Rio wasn't here. And Marina who accepted the
powers from Rio as well...)"	
Message	None	(But then it all changed today.)	
Message	None	I'll be waiting.	
Message	None	"(A text with just three words. No location.
A one-sided promise. But this text had so
much meaning. I don't know why, but that's how I felt.)"	
Message	None	"(So I came here. The place I met Marina for the first
time. She should be―)"	
Message	Shido	(―Found you. I knew you'd be here.)	
Message	Marina	"Aww, man. So you did find me. It's been... about a
week?"	
Message	Shido	"Yeah. I was worried. I couldn't find you... So I
thought maybe you were still in Maria."	
Message	Marina	Hey, Shido Itsuka... This world is huge.	
Message	Shido	"Yeah it is. The starry skies are all connected. But
this Eden is―"	
Message	Marina	―It's connected.	
Message	Shido	Huh?	
Message	None	"(My mind went blank. Eden was a closed off
wonderland. We shouldn't be able to leave Tengu City.
A rule made to keep the world repeating itself.)"	
Message	Marina	"Why do you look so dumbfounded? This Eden changed
its settings since I became the Ruler. No, I changed
them."	
Message	Shido	You changed its settings?	
Message	Marina	"Time will not loop infinitely―it will only move
forward. There is no end of the world. That is what
this new Eden is. It goes until Shido Itsuka dies."	
Message	Shido	Until I die? Then you and Rinne can only exist...	
Message	Marina	"That's right. Maybe 30 or 50 years... Or it could be
10 years."	
Message	Shido	"Is that okay with you? The promise you made with
Rio..."	
Message	Marina	"It's fine like this. Humans die someday, too. Rinne
Sonogami and I received a future from Rio to live as
humans."	
Message	Shido	A future to live as humans...	
Message	Marina	"It's nothing special. This is all a dream. A dream
that you'll forget when you wake up. So you can do
anything, and everything will come true."	
Message	Shido	A dream, huh... I see.	
Message	None	"(So if I die, Eden will end, and we'll forget
everything and return back to the original world.)"	
Message	None	"(That just means that everyone living in this town
will be guaranteed a future. Even if that means they
have to live a fake daily life for a little while.)"	
Message	Marina	"So that's why I decided to live life to the fullest. I
want to live this life, the time that Rio gave, one
step at a time. It's precious."	
Message	Shido	I'm rooting for you, Marina. I want to help if I can.	
Message	Marina	Really? You really think you will?	
Message	Shido	"Why would I lie about this? Unlike you, I keep the
promises I make."	
Message	Marina	Then come here.	
Message	Shido	Okay.	
Message	None	"(I did as she asked and went to the stairs. Then
Marina, who was a few steps before me, reached for
me―)"	
Message	Marina	If I do this, I can look you straight in the face.	
Message	Shido	"Well guys are usually taller... Hey wait, what are you
doing...?!"	
Message	Marina	"I told you that I'm going to live life to the fullest,
didn't I? So I am going to do what I want."	
Message	Shido	So how does this connect?	
Message	Marina	"...Well, I don't blame you for being confused. I'm not
very honest, and you're very dull about these things."	
Message	Shido	Um, I don't get it at all...	
Message	Marina	"That's why I said you're a dummy. There's only one
reason why we're like this."	
Message	None	"(She looked straight at me. It was similar to when
Maria looked into my eyes before―)"	
Message	Marina	I love you... Shido Itsuka.	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	"(I was so shy that I wanted to turn away, but Marina
had her arms around my neck and wouldn't let me.)"	
Message	Marina	"I can't help it. You're the first person I've been
honest with. I mean you're always looking after me, I
can't help but get the wrong idea."	
Message	Shido	Well... I was.	
Message	Marina	"It's fine. This is me confessing my love to you. But
Rio called me Mother."	
Message	None	"(Rio did call Marina Mother before she disappeared.
She called Rinne Mama, but she referred to Marina
as one who raised her as mother.)"	
Message	Marina	"I can't run away then, can I? Until I tell Father how
I really feel about him."	
Message	Shido	Marina...	
Message	Marina	"You don't have to give me an answer. Even if you
chose another person, it won't change the fact that
I have feelings for you. This is real."	
Message	Marina	So let me take my first step, okay?	
Message	None	"(I felt her breath as it neared. The somewhat sweet
scent of a girl. I could feel my heart starting to
race.)"	
Message	None	"(Marina looked a little scared, and that made my heart
pound for her. If we ended up not kissing, I felt like
she'd disappear... so I let the kiss happen.)"	
Message	Marina	...Mm.	
Message	None	"(Her acting tough was all an act. Deep down, she felt
lonely. I felt like Marina's emotion flowed inside me
through her soft lips.)"	
Message	None	"(I want to help Marina. I want to be by her side when
she's feeling lonely. But I think... it's still not
love yet.)"	
Message	None	"(As our lips parted, Marina's eyes opened. For a
second, I wanted to linger, but reason made it go
away.)"	
Message	Shido	"Sorry. I still don't know... if I have feelings for
you or not."	
Message	Marina	"I know that already. Shido, you're too nice, so I
know you can't decide on the most important person
for yourself."	
Message	Shido	I guess huh... Pathetic, huh?	
Message	Marina	Seriously, you're so pathetic... Hehe.	
Message	Shido	D-Don't laugh... I mean, I know it's kind of true...	
Message	Marina	"Yeah... But Shido, when you kissed me, you kind of
looked like a pretty cool adult."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that...?	
Message	Marina	Shido, you say that, but I know you know.	
Message	Shido	No, I have no idea what you're talking about...	
Message	None	"(It's true. Before we kissed, I kind of felt like I
was floating from the heat...)"	
Message	Marina	Gosh... Then I'll do it so you know. Please?	
Message	Shido	Um, what are you going to do?	
Message	None	"(As I said that, I felt my heart pounding fast again.
Maybe I'm not as nice as I thought..)"	
Message	Marina	It's easy―We do it again.	
Message	None	(And then Marina laughed like a girl playing a joke.)
