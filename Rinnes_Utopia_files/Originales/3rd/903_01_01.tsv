Message	Shido	*Yawn*... Morning.	
Message	Kotori	Morning, Onii-chan!	
Message	Rinne	Morning, Shido. You sure look sleepy.	
Message	Maria	Shido. Good morning. Breakfast is ready.	
Message	Shido	Oh, thank you. Sorry for leaving it all to you guys.	
Message	Rinne	It's not a big deal. I'm just doing what I enjoy.	
Message	Maria	"Yes, likewise. However, Shido... You should think
about the days that Rinne and I won't be here and
wake up a bit earlier."	
Message	Kotori	Yeah, if that happens, breakfast would be lunch～	
Message	Shido	Oh, you're right... Sorry.	
Message	Maria	"We're not scolding you. We just want you to be a little
more responsible."	
Message	Shido	*Grunt*... Okay.	
Message	None	"(It's true. Since they were always here, I've started
to become complacent. I have no rebuttal.)"	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha, Maria-chan... That was a bit hard on Shido.	
Message	Maria	That's fine. It's important that he knows.	
Message	Rinne	"Gosh, Maria-chan... Anyways Shido, if you just stand
there, your breakfast will get cold."	
Message	Shido	Ah, sorry! Thanks!	
Message	None	(I tried to play off my discomfort and sat down.)	
Message	Kotori	"Man, I'm so excited. We're having a cooking class at
Rinne-onechan's place."	
Message	Shido	A cooking class?	
Message	Rinne	"Remember how Tohka-chan said she wanted me to
teach her how to cook? So I've been visiting her
whenever I have some spare time."	
Message	Shido	"Ah, Maria did tell me about it, but... Wow, a cooking
class?"	
Message	Rinne	"Hahaha. It's not that big of a deal. Tobiichi-san and
Tokisaki-san said that they wanted to join, too...
So then we figured it'd be fun if we all got together."	
Message	Shido	Ah... I see.	
Message	None	"(Then that means almost everyone's gathered there,
huh? If she's taking care of all of them, that's
pretty tough.)"	
Message	Rinne	"Oh, don't worry though. We plan on finishing up by
the evening. I'll be making dinner for you."	
Message	Shido	"No, don't worry about me, okay? I can do things on
my own, and worst-case scenario, I can just eat out."	
Message	Maria	That's right, Rinne. And he has me as well.	
Message	Rinne	"Uh-uh. Yesterday I left him all to you, Maria-chan,
so I'm going to ask you to take care of lunch instead,
and I'll do dinner. Okay?"	
Message	Maria	If that's what you want to do, Rinne, I'll respect it.	
Message	Rinne	Thank you, Maria-chan.	
Message	Kotori	"Seems like not only is Rinne an older sister, but
Maria's becoming one too. I'm getting more big
sisters!"	
Message	Shido	When you say that, I feel like we'll get even more...	
Message	None	(They're not toys.)	
Message	Kotori	"Why are you looking like that? I'm only kidding, gosh.
The only time I'll get a new sister is when you get
married."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's true but... Marriage. It's such a long
while away."	
Message	Kotori	"Who knows. ...Well, I'll never allow you to marry, so
I'll never get a real sister until the end of time."	
Message	Shido	Hm? Did you say anything?	
Message	Kotori	"No, nothing.
"	
Message	Kotori	"Anyways Onii-chan, you're off today. What are you
going to do?"	
Message	Shido	"Uh... I'm going to go shopping. I'll head into town
and check some things out."	
Message	Kotori	Okay, okay. Got it.	
Message	Shido	Do your best to learn from Rinne, okay?	
Message	Kotori	"Hehehe. Don't underestimate me! Just give me a day,
and I'll surpass you."	
Message	Rinne	I-I don't think you can pull that off...	
Message	Maria	"I know. Even if it's you, Kotori, it's not something
you can figure out in a day or two."	
Message	Shido	Haha... Yeah.	
Message	Kotori	Gosh, you guys suck!	
Message	Rinne	Hahaha...	
Message	Maria	Hehehe...	
Message	None	"(Rinne's and Maria's laughter echoed through the
living room. Why did I find that so dear? As the
thought came to mind, my smile almost faded.)"	
Message	Shido	Well, I have to get ready.	
Message	None	(I tried to brush it off, and returned to my room.)	
Message	Maria	Shido...	
Message	Shido	Rio and Marina... They're still not here.	
Message	Rio	Morning, Papa!	
Message	Shido	Morning Rio. Where's Marina?	
Message	Rio	Marina? She's not here.	
Message	Shido	"Not here... Oh come to think of it, you did say she
only comes out after dark..."	
Message	Rio	"Marina is Rio's guardian. She'll be with me when it's
dangerous."	
Message	None	"(I don't know why, but it seems like Marina can only
come out at night. I guess we can't do anything about
that.)"	
Message	Shido	Then that means it's just you and me, huh?	
Message	Rio	No? One more person, right?	
Message	Shido	One more person? It's only Rio and me...	
Message	Rio	Right, Maria-chan?	
Message	Shido	...Maria?	
Message	Maria	...So you've noticed me.	
Message	Shido	Maria... Why?	
Message	Maria	"Sorry Shido. I was curious about you, so... I wasn't
planning on getting caught."	
Message	Shido	What do you mean by that?	
Message	Maria	Exactly what it means.	
Message	Shido	Oh, come on...	
Message	None	"(Maria always had a tendency of following people, so
I guess I would have eventually gotten caught.)"	
Message	None	"(But it seemed like Maria caught on yesterday. Maybe
she sensed Marina since she's like a sibling to her.)"	
Message	Maria	"This will be my first time meeting you, Rio. I'm Maria
Arusu."	
Message	Rio	"Yeah! Nice to meet you! But it doesn't feel like the
first time, huh?"	
Message	Maria	"Is that so? That's nice of you. To have an adorable
girl like you say that sure is nice."	
Message	Rio	Adorable? Rio's adorable?	
Message	Maria	Yes, very. To the point where I want to hug you.	
Message	Rio	Thank you, Maria-onechan.	
Message	Maria	"Not at all. I just spoke the truth. But it kind of tickles
to have you call me One-chan."	
Message	Rio	"You don't know? You can call anyone like a sister
One-chan."	
Message	Maria	*giggle*... I see. You have a point there.	
Message	None	"(As she said that, Maria patted Rio's head. It seemed
so familiar―)"	
Message	Shido	Hey, Maria. Don't tell me you...	
Message	Maria	"I was listening to your conversation earlier. So,
Marina is taking care of her, right?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that's right. Then she...	
Message	Maria	Yes I know. But we'll save that for later.	
Message	None	"(Maria looked me in the eye, and it seemed like she
didn't want me to say any more. She's right. Rio
shouldn't hear things she doesn't need to.)"	
Message	Maria	Anyways, Rio. Where do you plan on going with Shido?	
Message	Rio	"Where am I going with, Papa? Lots of places. We're
looking for the most important thing!"	
Message	Maria	The most important thing, huh?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. Rio is supposed to look for it.	
Message	Maria	I see. So, does it have a shape?	
Message	Rio	Hm... I don't know. But if I find it, I think I'll know.	
Message	Maria	That sure seems vague... May I help?	
Message	Rio	"Really?! If you can help me, One-chan, Rio will be
really happy! You too, right Papa?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, that'd make me happy.	
Message	None	"(And besides... if Rio's with us, I may be able to
have Maria and Marina meet.)"	
Message	None	"(Maybe in this world, I can reunite the two who
would've otherwise never been able to see one
another again. Well... Marina might be shy about it.)"	
Message	Rio	Well, then it'll be the three of us!	
Message	None	"(Rio happily held Maria's hand. Despite their meeting
for the first time, it seems like she's already fond
of her. Maybe she's sensing Marina in Maria.)"	
Message	Maria	Sure. Let's find what you're looking for.	
Message	None	"(I couldn't add to what Maria said. I still didn't
know if I could let Rio find it.)"	
Message	None	"""(But even so, we set off to look for ""the most
important thing"". There were no hints to speak of, so
all we could do was walk around town.)"""	
Message	Rio	Papa, do you think it'll be in this store?	
Message	Shido	"Hey, Rio... Is what you're looking for something we
can buy?"	
Message	Rio	Hmm... maybe? It could be, it might not be.	
Message	Shido	"So you don't know, huh? I thought you might know
where to start looking."	
Message	Rio	"I'm just following it. I'm looking a lot, but I don't
see it anywhere."	
Message	Maria	"So we have no choice but to look where Rio thinks...
In that case, this will be very difficult."	
Message	Shido	...Sure will be.	
Message	None	"""(I gave a wry smile but... I was relieved deep inside
If Rio had said, ""It looks like a key,"" then I.
wouldn't have known what to say.)"""	
Message	None	"(If I were really going to help Rio with her search,
it would be quicker to start by showing her the spare
key. But I couldn't bring myself to do it.)"	
Message	None	"(I had no basis for it, but... I felt like if I did that,
we'd get to a place where there was no turning back.
That feeling took over my body.)"	
Message	Rio	U-Um, that store... I feel something strong.	
Message	Maria	"A toy store. There's a big rabbit plush doll displayed
on the show window."	
Message	Shido	You wanna try going in?	
Message	Rio	Yeah, I'm curious about what's inside!	
Message	Maria	Rio, please don't pull on me. I'll go with you.	
Message	Shido	...It seems like she just wants to go in.	
Message	None	"(Well, Rio is a child, so it's only natural that she's
interested in toys. I can understand why she'd give
an excuse to go inside. Kotori did the same thing.)"	
Message	Rio	Wow, this is amazing. It looks like a real phone!	
Message	Maria	"Toy manufacturers seem to be creating toys with
multiple functions these days. This one has online
data updates and pairs with game consoles, too."	
Message	Rio	Is this guitar a toy, too? Can you really play it?	
Message	Maria	"You're right. It seems to be a pretend item. It seems
like the accessory that comes with it is synced with
the game console."	
Message	Rio	"If you change the accessory, you can change the
song, too! Here I go, kira-kira-live!"	
Message	Maria	"No, Rio. Although it's a display, you can't play with
the store items."	
Message	Rio	I'm sorry, Maria-onechan. I'll be careful.	
Message	Maria	Yes, please do so.	
Message	Shido	You two look like you're having fun.	
Message	None	"(Rio must be happy to be with Maria. I'm sure it's
hard to go inside stores with Marina.)"	
Message	Rio	"Rio saw this on the TV. You're supposed to stack them
and make them stronger, and then you go ""BAM!
right?"""	
Message	Maria	"That's called a trading card game. There are various
types of cards that you can gather and use to battle
with your friends."	
Message	Rio	I see. Then... that's it! Let's do this!	
Message	Maria	O-Okay... But only once, okay? My turn. Draw!	
Message	Shido	Well, I can't just leave them like this, can I?	
Message	None	(I ran after the two and entered the toy store.)	
Message	Shido	...*sigh*. This is just us playing.	
Message	None	"(After the toy store, we went to the book store,
then the flower shop, then a stationery store. We
still couldn't find what we were looking for.)"	
Message	Rio	Hey, Rio isn't playing! I'm looking.	
Message	Maria	"That's right, Shido. Seeing Rio this adorable, it's
wrong to complain."	
Message	Shido	"What Rio said made sense, but I don't know about
you... Maria!"	
Message	Maria	"I'm only kidding. But Rio looked like she was having
so much fun. I think that's all that matters."	
Message	Shido	"I guess you have a point... But we shouldn't lose
sight of our goal."	
Message	Maria	Hehe... You wouldn't fall for it, huh?	
Message	Shido	Yeah... Not this time.	
Message	Rio	"Yeah, Maria-onechan. You have to say something
that makes more sense, or else Papa won't fall for it."	
Message	Shido	Can you not casually say such a scary thing?!	
Message	Rio	Hehehe... Papa, you're funny.	
Message	Maria	"Yes. Shido is funny. I never get tired of watching
him."	
Message	Rio	Yeah, I totally get it! Papa is amazing.	
Message	Shido	"Hahaha. Yeah, right? That somehow doesn't sound like
a compliment."	
Message	None	"(Well, we had a goal in the beginning, but now... I
guess the right thing to do would be to just enjoy
spending time together like this.)"	
Message	None	"(There were so many unknowns, like what kind of
existence Rio was. But I know it's better to just
smile.)"	
Message	None	"(Especially if this is a world with a time limit, and
these imaginary days are numbered... I know there's
still value to the time we spend here.)"	
Message	Rio	Papa, that's a place where we can eat, right?	
Message	Shido	"Yeah, that's a family restaurant. It's a bit after lunch
time, huh?"	
Message	Rio	Yeah, I wanna go!	
Message	None	"(We spent so much time in all the stores, it was
getting pretty late. It was a bit too late for lunch.)"	
Message	Maria	"Then let's go. Judging from the outside, there seem
to be open seats."	
Message	Shido	You can tell?	
Message	Maria	"I remember that place. And besides, I doubt there
would be any obstacles for Rio in this world."	
Message	Shido	You have a point...	
Message	None	"(If Rio is controlling Eden, then things should go
exactly as we plan.)"	
Message	None	(Hm... But did I tell Maria that much?)	
Message	Rio	"Hey, Papa. You need to hurry, or the seats will get
taken!"	
Message	Shido	Oh, Rio, don't yank me...!	
Message	Rio	"So much food. What should I order? Hmm... This...
No... Or this one? Um... Uh... Uh... What do I pick..."	
Message	Maria	"You can choose anything you want, so it's fine.
Take your time."	
Message	Rio	Okay! Thanks, Maria-onechan!	
Message	None	"(Rio flipped through the pages and went back and
forth, looking like she was having fun choosing.)"	
Message	Rio	"Hmm... Rio wants to order so many things. I can't
choose one."	
Message	Maria	"Then please choose Shido's and my order, too.
Then you'll be able to choose up to three."	
Message	Shido	"She's right. Why don't you start off with that? We'll
come again to try out the others."	
Message	Rio	"Again? Okay... You're right! Then... This, this... and this.
Papa, One-chan, are you okay with this?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, sure. I'm fine with anything you like, Rio.	
Message	Maria	"A Hamburg steak combo, omurice, and spaghetti with
meat sauce. I'm worried about how much Rio can eat..."	
Message	Shido	Well, I'm sure we can manage. Let's order.	
Message	Rio	Rio wants to order. Please?	
Message	Maria	"Sure. It's important to try anything. But if you get
it wrong, it won't be good, so you do your best okay?"	
Message	Rio	"Not good if I get it wrong...! Okay... got it. Rio
will do her best."	
Message	None	"(Rio timidly pushed the button, and she looked so
nervous that it was adorable.)"	
Message	Rio	Phew. I'm full.	
Message	None	"(After we left the restaurant, Rio looked satisfied.
I think two hours had passed since we sat down.
The sun was already setting.)"	
Message	Shido	Rio, you ate so much. I'm proud of you.	
Message	Rio	Hehe. Is Rio a good girl?	
Message	Shido	Yeah, you are. Good girl.	
Message	Rio	*Yawn*	
Message	Maria	"I was so surprised to see you finish the whole
omurice. And you even ate cake and pudding for
dessert..."	
Message	Rio	One-chan, sweet things go in another stomach.	
Message	Maria	"You must like sweet things. Is that why you like Shido
too?"	
Message	Shido	Hey Maria, what's that supposed to mean...	
Message	Maria	"I mean exactly what I said. Shido, you're sweet to
girls."	
Message	Shido	I can't deny that...	
Message	Rio	"I don't get it. Rio loves Papa. Do you not love Papa,
Maria-onechan?"	
Message	Maria	No, I love Shido too.	
Message	Shido	Hey, wait Maria. Not here.	
Message	Maria	But it's the truth. And is that a surprise to you?	
Message	Shido	Well, you have a point but...	
Message	None	"(But it's a day off and we're in town. Who knows if
we might bump into people we know―especially
those from school.)"	
Message	Maria	"If you have a problem with the location, then we can
go home or to the park."	
Message	Shido	"Well, that's not what I meant... But we did look all
around this area. The sun's setting already, so we
should call it a day."	
Message	None	"(And it may be time for Marina to come out. Then I can
have Maria and Marina meet.)"	
Message	Rio	Okay got it. Then let's go to the park!	
Message	Shido	H-Hey, Rio! Don't run, it's dangerous!	
Message	Rio	It's just to there, so it's okay!	
Message	Shido	That kid...	
Message	Maria	Hehe... Shido, you're starting to act like a father.	
Message	Shido	"You could at least say brother. Now... Hey, wait! Rio!
I'm going to go home now!"	
Message	Rio	No!!! You're a meanie, Papa!	
Message	Shido	"Then you just stand there! You hear me?! Hey, Maria.
Sorry, I know you just ate, but let's go."	
Message	Maria	"Okay, let's go. We can't leave your precious family
alone."	
Message	None	"(Rio would suddenly run and then stop, then run and
then stop, staying just ahead of us so we wouldn't
catch up.)"	
Message	None	"(It's fine that we're running after her, but both
Maria and I were thrown off by Rio's pace.)"	
Message	Shido	*Pant, pant*... Don't make us run after we eat, Rio...	
Message	Rio	Hehe. But we're playing chase. That was fun!	
Message	Shido	...Well, I'm glad you had fun.	
Message	None	"(That was a workout... Well, the park feels pretty nice.
The weather's nice and the wind is blowing.)"	
Message	Rio	...Hey, Papa. Do you not like it here?	
Message	Shido	Rio...?	
Message	None	"(I don't know how I knew, but I realized that when Rio
said ""here"", she didn't mean the park.)"	
Message	Rio	"Rio loves it here. I mean, I can see you, Papa. And
Marina. And... everyone is smiling."	
Message	None	"(I know. I know that. Everyone's here. There's so
much happiness in this world.)"	
Message	Shido	Well...	
Message	None	"(Things that disappeared came back. I didn't know
anymore... whether what I thought was right was
actually right...)"	
Message	Shido	...Hey, Rio. I―	
Message	Rio	Hmmm... hmmm...	
Message	Shido	Wh-What's the matter, Rio?	
Message	Rio	I'm getting a little sleepy...	
Message	Maria	Shido, please bring Rio here.	
Message	Shido	Okay, Rio. Here.	
Message	Maria	"She must be sleepy because she's full. Hehe. She's
so adorable, look at her sleeping."	
Message	Shido	"We have walked everywhere since this morning, plus
she was just running... I'm not surprised that she's
tired."	
Message	Maria	"You're probably right. And besides, I do hear it's
important to make children take naps."	
Message	None	"(Maria gently ran her fingers through Rio's hair. They
looked so sweet. But at the same time, this was a
scene that couldn't happen in reality.)"	
Message	Maria	"Shido... Now that Rio's sleeping, can I ask you one
thing?"	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Maria	"""Shido... I think you already realize what that ""the
most important thing"" is, don't you?"""	
Message	Shido	...?!	
Message	None	Thanks Shido... I'll take good care of this.	
Message	Maria	I knew it...	
Message	Shido	No, Maria, it's not like that... I, um...	
Message	Maria	"Shido, you're a kind person. You're probably thinking
about someone else again... You don't want to hurt
someone, and you're hurting too, aren't you?"	
Message	Shido	"No, it's not that! That's not it... It's not something
that nice... I... I just..."	
Message	None	"(I couldn't put it into words. Rinne, Maria, Marina...
and Rio. There were too many... too many people I
didn't want to lose.)"	
Choice		...Sorry, I can't really put it into words.	
Choice		...I don't want to give up.	
Message	Shido	...Sorry, I can't really put it into words.	
Message	Shido	...I don't want to give up.	
Message	Maria	"I see. But I believe in you. I know that you'll pick
the right answer."	
Message	Shido	"The right answer... Is there such a thing? I don't
know what that is."	
Message	Maria	"Even so, I know you'll choose it at the end. That's
how you've been saving people all these time. Like...
you did with me."	
Message	Shido	Maria...	
Message	None	"(Ever since I found out about the Spirits, I've made
a lot of decisions. I don't know whether they were
right. Maybe there were a bunch of mistakes.)"	
Message	Maria	"You might stress about it. You might think you're not
ready. But Shido, you've always made the right
decisions. I guarantee that."	
Message	Shido	...Maria. Can you read my heart?	
Message	Maria	"I don't think so. However, I have been watching you,
Shido."	
Message	Shido	I see...	
Message	Maria	"You're always working so hard for other people.
That's why everyone likes you so much."	
Message	Maria	"So I'm going to represent everyone and promise...
No matter what you choose, I'll believe that it was
the right decision. I have faith in you."	
Message	Shido	...Thanks, Maria.	
Message	Maria	You're welcome. That's what a good wife does.	
Message	Shido	"A good wife? You know... Well, thanks. I feel a lot
lighter now."	
Message	Maria	Yes, I am your Maria, Shido.	
Message	None	"(And I couldn't help but smile with her. We did this
recently, but it feels so far away.)"	
Message	Rio	Mm...mmm...	
Message	Rio	Morning, Papa. Maria-onechan.	
Message	Maria	Good morning, Rio. You slept well.	
Message	Shido	Good morning. You feel better now?	
Message	Rio	Yeah, I'm not sleepy anymore.	
Message	Shido	"Okay then, Marina might come any minute now.
The sun's setting."	
Message	Rio	Yeah, it's evening. It seems dark over there.	
Message	None	"(Rio pointed toward the sky. It's true. The sky was
like an orange gradient.)"	
Message	Rio	Hey, Papa. It's almost time...	
Message	Shido	Time? Time for what?	
Message	None	"(I looked around, and Maria was sitting on the swing
alone.)"	
Message	Rio	It's time. Marina.	
Message	Shido	...Marina? No, Rio. That's Maria there―	
Message	Rio	But I'm not wrong...	
Message	Marina	"Gosh, you really do put us in a bind. You should
have left Shido Itsuka a long time ago."	
Message	Rio	I messed up.	
Message	Marina	"Aw, when you say that with a smile, it's not fair.
Anyways, Shido Itsuka... Do I have something on my
face?"	
Message	Shido	"Wait, but... Aren't you Maria? Your clothes are the
same..."	
Message	Marina	"I guess I'll tell you everything. So Rio, you go play
over there."	
Message	Rio	Okay, I'll wait for you.	
Message	Marina	So, where should I start? Any questions?	
Message	Shido	Questions... I mean, where did Maria go?	
Message	Marina	"...Ah, from there huh? In this world, I am Marina and
Maria. Do you understand?"	
Message	None	"(Maria is gone and Marina appeared. Considering the
circumstances...)"	
Message	Shido	So... you guys are two in one?	
Message	Marina	"Correct. I disappeared that time. But I left a present
in the end. You know what that is, right?"	
Message	Shido	Maria's data...	
Message	Marina	"Yeah. And inside there, I guess there was a little bit
of my data mixed in. So a small hint of black mixed
into white."	
Message	Shido	Th-Then, will we be able to resurrect your data?	
Message	Marina	"That's impossible. Not with Marina Arusu now.
It's like a ghost. A faint shadow that will disappear
some day."	
Message	Marina	"My body couldn't come back, even in this Eden.
Maria was able to be resurrected, but I'm so small
that I need Maria's body or I can't move about freely."	
Message	Shido	Marina... Are you okay with that?	
Message	Marina	"What do you mean? What choice do I have? This is
my final destination. There's nothing... beyond this
point."	
Message	Shido	That's... That's just too sad!	
Message	Marina	"Don't say that to me. I know myself. I have a role as
Rio Sonogami's―Eden's guardian. So I can exist like
this."	
Message	Shido	"...Eden's guardian? Kind of like the Angel that
appeared the last time?"	
Message	Marina	"That's right. I listen to Rio and I help her. That's
my role. Although I'm not forced to do so. And I can
cut through space and freely move to where Rio is."	
Message	Shido	"So that's why you were able to get to Rio before me?
So you guys really are sharing bodies."	
Message	Marina	"Yes. I feel bad that I'm causing Maria problems. But
Maria knows that I'm using her body."	
Message	Shido	So she's conscious now?	
Message	Marina	"She's awake, but kind of asleep. It's similar to when
Maria's out. Like I said... We're kind of mixed."	
Message	Marina	"I'm currently replicated from Maria so that might have
something to do with it. I'm currently Marina Arusu,
but not the same Marina Arusu that battled you before."	
Message	Marina	So don't worry about me.	
Message	Shido	Marina!	
Message	Marina	"I won't go back to the original world, and even if I'm
in Eden, I'll eventually completely melt inside
Maria... and disappear."	
Message	Shido	Are you okay with that...?! I can't just accept it!	
Message	Marina	"I disappeared once. So, Shido Itsuka... You should
look more toward the future."	
Message	Shido	The future...?	
Message	Marina	"Just like before, you should get out of these endless
days, and live in the world where you should be. And
be happy there. Isn't such a future awesome?"	
Message	None	"(I understand where Marina's coming from. But she's
saying to just forget everything and live.)"	
Message	None	"(It means abandoning Rinne, Marina, and Rio... It
means that kind of future.)"	
Choice		I think you're right.	
Choice		Everything isn't always about being right.	
Message	Shido	"What you're saying is right, Marina. I do feel like we
should get out of here."	
Message	Marina	"Hehe... If you were still contemplating, that would be
my recommendation. Humans forget what they don't
need to remember. So, that chance has come for you."	
Message	Shido	That may be true...	
Message	Shido	I think everything isn't always about being right.	
Message	Marina	Is that your answer?	
Message	Shido	"I still don't know. But to have you guys disappear and
for everything to end... I just can't accept that."	
Message	Marina	I see. You're too nice at times like these.	
Message	None	"(Marina's smile in the sunset was so beautiful, yet
fleeting. It was loving.)"	
Message	None	"(Is that beauty going to flutter away? No, that can't
be true. I've discovered it for the first time. Marina
Arusu is a girl who can smile like this.)"	
Message	Marina	"Right, so we're done talking here. Someone's waiting
for you, so you should go home now."	
Message	Shido	No. Will you two come with me?	
Message	Marina	"What? Can you stop with that? Rio and I have things
to do."	
Message	Shido	...But we don't have much time, right?	
Message	Marina	I know, but... That's more of a reason―	
Message	Shido	Shouldn't we have her meet Rinne?	
Message	Marina	―?! That's...!	
Message	Shido	Hey, Rio! You want to see Mama?	
Message	Rio	"Mama?! Hey Papa, I can see Mama? Marina said if I
see her, it won't be good."	
Message	Shido	No. Papa will allow it.	
Message	Marina	Hey, Shido! But what if something happens?	
Message	Shido	"Well even if it did, it's better than not seeing one
another at all. Right, Rio?"	
Message	Rio	Yeah! Rio wants to talk to Mama!	
Message	Marina	"...You got me. Fine, I guess! Ugh. Gosh, what is up
with you and your sudden ideas and your actions
and making things happen..."	
Message	Shido	"That's my personality. Sorry Marina, you're going to
have to do this with me."	
Message	Marina	"I guess there's no point in my just standing here.
Only today, though. If something happens to Rio,
then we'll leave immediately. Got it?"	
Message	Shido	Yeah, thanks.	
Message	Marina	Hmph... Gosh, you're so stubborn.	
Message	None	"(I still haven't found my answer yet. But I don't want
it to just end like this. So I'm going to do what I
can now.)"	
Message	None	"(Until the very last moment, I want to have these
smiles last even one second longer.)"
