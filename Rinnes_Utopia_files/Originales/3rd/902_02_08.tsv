Message	Shido	"All right, why don't we go to Tengu Tower? What do
you say, Rio?"	
Message	Rio	Okay, if you're going to go Papa, I'll go.	
Message	Shido	It's perfect for a stroll. You want to hold hands?	
Message	Rio	Yeah!	
Message	None	"(I held Rio's small hand. It reminded me a little of
holding hands with Kotori. It's such a rare thing to
hold hands with a child.)"	
Message	Rio	Papa, your hand is warm.	
Message	Shido	Yeah? So is yours, Rio.	
Message	Rio	Papa and Rio are the same.	
Message	Shido	Yeah, we are.	
Message	Shido	Wow, that was fast.	
Message	Rio	Yeah, it went fast because I was with you!	
Message	Miku	"Hey, darling!
"	
Message	Miku	And a cute girl!	
Message	Yuzuru	Disbelief. Shido, what are you doing here?	
Message	Shido	Oh, um...	
Message	Rio	Papa is on a stroll with Rio.	
Message	Miku	P-Papa?! Darling... is this girl... your hidden child?!	
Message	Yuzuru	Wonder. Shido, you had a secret child...	
Message	Shido	"No, I didn't! And how old would I have been when I
had this child?!"	
Message	Miku	My... darling, such a pervert at such a young age.	
Message	Shido	"Can you not say things that give people the wrong
idea?!"	
Message	Rio	Papa... You're a pervert?	
Message	Shido	"Well, guys kind of are to a certain point... Hey, no!
She's Tonomachi's relative. I'm taking care of her for
a little while."	
Message	Miku	Tonomachi-san? Who's that?	
Message	Shido	My frie... No, classmate.	
Message	Miku	Oh, is that so? Anyways, she's oh-so adorable.	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. It's hard to believe she's a relative of
Tonomachi's. She does look worthy of adoration."	
Message	Rio	Rio is cute? Miku-san and Yuzuru-chan?	
Message	Miku	"Yes. Veeeery adorable.
"	
Message	Miku	...Oh? You know my name?	
Message	Yuzuru	Wonder. How was such information leaked?	
Message	Shido	"Yuzuru, why are you thinking like that... I guess
Tonomachi told her? And Miku, you're a famous
person."	
Message	Yuzuru	Makes sense. You're right. That seems likely.	
Message	Miku	"Hehehe. Good girl, good girl. Oh, would you like to go
karaoke with us?"	
Message	Shido	"Karaoke? Well, I guess if we continue to walk, it
could be tiring. What do you want to do, Rio?"	
Message	Rio	"Miku-chan and Yuzuru-chan are both good singers,
right? Then Rio wants to hear!"	
Message	Miku	My, thank youuu. Yuzuru-san, is that okay with you?	
Message	Yuzuru	Affirmative. Of course. Will you sit next to Yuzuru?	
Message	Miku	Hey! Yuzuru-san, no fair!	
Message	Shido	Will you sing too, Rio?	
Message	Rio	Papa, you want to hear Rio sing?	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I definitely do.	
Message	Rio	Then only for you!	
Message	None	"(And so we all went to karaoke. Supposedly it was
Rio's first time but she seemed to have a lot of fun
singing alone or in duets with others.)"	
Message	None	"(Satisfied, we left and saw that the sky outside was
red.)"	
Message	Rio	Rio has to go soon.	
Message	Shido	Oh, is it time to see Marina?	
Message	Rio	Yeah. I promised her.	
Message	Shido	I see. Did you have fun?	
Message	Rio	Yes. I had a lot of fun.	
Message	Shido	Okay, good.	
Message	Rio	Well... Bye, Miku-chan, Yuzuru-chan. Let's sing again!	
Message	Miku	Okay, I look forward to it!	
Message	Yuzuru	"Agreed. Next time it would be fun to have Kaguya and
the others with us as well."	
Message	Miku	Oh, I agree! The more the merrier!	
Message	Shido	Hey, you two... Say bye to her.	
Message	Yuzuru	Reunite. Goodbye, Rio. Let's hang out again.	
Message	Miku	Bye-bye, Rio-chaaaan. Let's hang out again!	
Message	Rio	Okay! I can't wait to sing again!	
Message	None	"(...Hey wait. I had something to ask Marina and I totally
forgot. Oh well, next time I see her―)"	
Message	Rio	I forgot to tell you something, Papa.	
Message	Shido	Hm? What is it?	
Message	Rio	If you're going to visit today... Park, okay?	
Message	None	(Rio whispered into my ear.)	
Message	Shido	...Okay.	
Message	Rio	Bye-bye!	
Message	Miku	Darling, what did Rio-chan say?	
Message	Shido	"...She said thanks for today. That's nice. Rio seemed
to have a lot of fun."	
Message	None	(I couldn't tell her what Rio told me.)	
Message	Yuzuru	Relief. She really is a good child.	
Message	Shido	Yeah. I agree.	
Message	None	"(I remembered how happy the three looked, holding
microphones together, and I smiled.)"
